1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,400
Let's get back to Phil and Diane.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,200
<i>Phil's been having a hard time finding work,</i>

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,200
and Diane wants him to talk to her about his fear, his disappointment.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,800
And Phil wants Diane to trust him that they'll get through this,

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,600
ideally, without having to keep discussing feelings.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,100
Not your exact words, but am I wrong?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,300
And most guys out there are the same way,

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,900
but ladies, if you're feeling frustrated,

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,500
remember, it's not our fault.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,400
We were raised to be strong, not emotional,

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,600
to deny vulnerability, not embrace it.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,800
And do you know what that makes us? Dinosaurs.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>Nobody needs us</i> to hunt wild animals for food.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,100
Nobody needs us to cut down trees to build shelter.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,300
They need us to evolve, to catch up.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,700
Since the 1960s, women's roles have shifted radically.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,400
And as-uh, as their- in-as their roles have changed,

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,200
so have women, they've- they've, uh-

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,500
<i>well, they've become tougher,</i> and more demanding of us.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
They're partners.

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
And-and-who can blame them? Who-who can-

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,600
who can, uh...

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,100
expecting us to...

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
to do this...

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,400
Joe! Joe!

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Joe!

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,900
Joe.

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
<i>We need an ambulance.</i>

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,200

豪斯医生 第八季第13集</font>

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,200
You want? I'm good.

33
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
Your limp's almost gone.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,400
It pains me to interrupt the collegial banter,

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,700
<i>it pains me even more to listen to it continue.</i>

36
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,100
<i>38-year-old man.</i>

37
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,200
Spikes a fever and collapses during a speaking engagement.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,900
E.R. checks out blood volume, cardiac function, and autonomic reflexes, all normal.

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,700
Patient makes a living telling men to behave more like women.

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm surprised you didn't throw psych symptoms into the differential.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,200
Either way, could be a cerebral AVM. E.R. did a head CT. No sign of AVM.

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,700
Decent thought, though.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,700
The patient's philosophy makes perfect sense.

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,200
Its only flaw is that it's impossible.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,800
Evolution does not work that way. You can't talk legs onto a fish.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,100
We're gonna go extinct, and we're gonna do it drinking scotch and driving muscle cars.

47
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,200
Am I right?

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,300
Am I-thank you.

49
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,500
Cephalic fibromuscular dysplasia? It doesn't explain the fever.

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,200
The patient's talking about compromise.

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,900
If you don't think that's possible, you don't think relationships are possible.

52
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,100
Anyone in this room in a position to disprove that?
This guy's just playing to his audience.

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,200
Women are, by far, the biggest consumers <i>of the self-help industry.</i>

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,700
He could have a pulmonary embolism.

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,900
Clot in his lung increases right ventricular afterload, <i>drops the blood flow to his brain.</i>

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,600
We should do a pulmonary angiogram. Patient lacks major risk factors for a P.E.

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,800
Doesn't rule it out, just makes it unlikely.

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,900
Maybe we start with a D-dimer? Less invasive than the angiogram.

59
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,000
<i>Good idea.</i>

60
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Fine.

61
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,800
Now, I am hereby searching for a number two.

62
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,200
So I'm eating a lot of Bran.

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Also, I want a team leader.

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,700
Someone to fill Foreman's old job.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,900
Why?

66
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,200
You're right. We don't need any more structure.

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,400
It's not like we had a near-fatal stabbing.

68
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,700
Well, if it isn't the old ball and Ukraine.

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,700
Who's that?

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,700
His wife.

71
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Dominika. House.

72
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,600
You survived prison.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,700
And you Atlantic City, where they also have gangs and pruno,

74
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,600
but slightly less recidivism.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
I start Ukrainian food truck business.

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,700
After gambling-win, lose- everybody likes a little knish.

77
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,300
You're here, and I seem to remember throwing out

78
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,000
a bunch of certified letters from immigration.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm assuming there's a connection. Our green card interview is in four days.

80
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,100
They come to the apartment, they ask questions about marriage,

81
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,500
vacations, family history, what side of the bed each sleep on.

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,500
We've never taken a vacation, I don't like your family, and on top.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,000
I hear Kiev is lovely this time of year.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,200
And your mother, who may or may not be dead, for all I know, misses you.

85
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,000
Can it be that genius doctor is afraid to take on a silly government apparatchik?

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Well, I would say more not interested than afraid,

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
but why quibble? Then I go to plan "B."

88
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,400
Make you an offer that cannot be refused.

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,700
How long you been doing seminars?

90
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,300
The marriage counseling, just, uh, the past couple years. <i>Before that, I did corporate coaching.</i>

91
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Can't imagine the same advice works for both audiences.

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,100
Guess you shifted with the market?

93
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,300
There's nothing cynical about my husband. He and I- No, it's okay. I get it.

94
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,000
What guy thinks men should be more like women?

95
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,600
A macho jerk who got a big wake-up call courtesy of three drunks 

96
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
who beat the crap outta me <i>outside a sports bar in Milwaukee.</i>

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm guessing that explains the broken wrist <i>in your medical history?</i>

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,700
Those morons did me the biggest favor of my life.

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,600
I realized I'd sacrificed my health because I couldn't back down

100
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,300
from an argument over football.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Meeting Marlene was the final piece in the puzzle.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She changed my career, my diet.

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,700
She gave me a whole new direction in life.

104
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,900
We'll need to know exactly how you changed your diet, <i>and when.</i>

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,800
Need my apartment key back.
If you're breaking up with me, can we at least talk about it first?

106
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,100
Maybe if you weren't all nag and no shag.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,100
I don't sleep with married men.

108
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll get a copy made. You're an ex-con.

109
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,000
If you get caught perjuring yourself to Homeland Security, you'll end up back in jail.

110
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,800
And that would be troubling if there was
 the slightest chance that we'd get caught.

111
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
You barely know each other.

112
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
You've got about five minutes
 to remake yourselves into a convincing married couple.

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,500
And why?

114
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,900
Dominika gets a green card. What's in this for you?

115
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,000
This is what men do for the women they pretend to love.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,600
Also, she's paying me 30,000 bucks once we pass.

117
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,800
Apparently knishes sell like hotcakes.

118
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,500
Lab results.

119
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,100
Afraid you're gonna have to finish your nag later.

120
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
I said I think it's stupid, right?

121
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,600
Then I think I'm done.

122
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,600
D- dimer came back normal. Rules out pulmonary embolism.

123
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,500
And our patient's a true believer about the follies of masculinity.

124
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,000
He underwent a spiritual overhaul three years ago.

125
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,000
He also went off gluten and red meat.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,500
Unfortunately, that doesn't explain any of his symptoms.

127
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,100
One of those points is not absurd. What's absurd about a change of heart?

128
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,500
What this guy believes is making him a better person.

129
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,300
He's going against his baser instincts. "Base" meaning foundational.

130
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,400
Meaning things we are biologically programmed to do.

131
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,800
Yes, perfectly natural that he stopped doing that stuff.

132
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,400
You know, that's the kind of lapse that could take you out of the running for team leader.

133
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,500
I feel surprisingly okay with that.

134
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,900
Comes with a 50-buck-a-week raise.

135
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm in. You don't want to do that.

136
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,100
Might need your dignity later in life. You didn't.

137
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,700
And she could be on her way to living the dream

138
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,200
unless the rest of you nut up and give her-

139
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,700
this spiritual overhaul...

140
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,300
Did it come after a physical overhaul?

141
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
A major injury of some kind? <i>Bar fight.</i>

142
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,000
But there's no way a broken wrist explains-

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Adams, come with me. You too.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,300
You guys...

145
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,400
Get a copy of that made.

146
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,000
Did those dudes bend your ball sack like Beckham?

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Three years ago. The bar fight.

148
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,100
This is Dr. House. He has a theory.

149
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,200
Oh, Dr. Adams, would you mind?

150
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,900
I asked you a question. I assume you know the answer.

151
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,700
Yeah, I took a couple serious knees to the groin.

152
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
Wha- <i>what has gotten into me?</i>

153
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
Dr. Chase.

154
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,300
Just pick it up.

155
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,300
<i>Do you know what's wrong with me?</i>

156
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,900
<i>Nothing that The Golden Girls</i>
couldn't have handled in 23 hilarious minutes.

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,100
You had a hot flash.

158
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,900
Those guys kicked your guys hard enough to do lasting damage.

159
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,000
You didn't even look when presented with
 two reasonably attractive tuchi.

160
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,200
Yeah, I said it!

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
I was listening to my doctor.

162
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,600
People generally listen with their ears, leaving their eyes free to wander.

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm guessing that your testosterone level is just below "Bieber. "

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,300
Do a blood test to confirm, and STT hormone replacement.

165
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,400
It's no wonder that you think women are so great.

166
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,000
You've basically been one for the last three years.

167
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Tests confirm House is right.

168
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Low testosterone explains all your symptoms. They should go away with replacement therapy.

169
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,200
Uh, we're gonna give you a fairly high dose.

170
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
Over time, your personal physician may reduce it a little.

171
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,000
Just need you to turn around.

172
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,700
Will the shots increase his libido? Are you worried about that?

173
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,000
No.

174
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,100
Have you been unsatisfied?

175
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,300
No. No, it's just...

176
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,100
Well, it's usually me that initiates things.

177
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,700
Sometimes I-

178
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,400
I think maybe you aren't that attracted to me.

179
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,300
Are you crazy?
With these injections, you will see an increase in sex drive.

180
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,700
Okay, great. Yeah.

181
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay.

182
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,300
All done. Okay.

183
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,699
<i>Oh, something's wrong.</i> I think I peed myself.

184
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,400
<i>Is that from the testosterone?</i>

185
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,600
It couldn't be.

186
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,800
I don't think you're going home just yet.

187
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,800
<i>It's not a plumbing problem.</i> <i>Means it's probably neurological.</i>

188
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
And?

189
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,800
<i>And name Dominika's three brothers.</i>

190
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,100
Volodymyr, Oleksiy, and...

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,700
Low testosterone is off the table as a symptom.

192
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,400
Guy got his nuts cracked three years ago.

193
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,800
<i>Don't need to look much further than that.</i>

194
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,600
So his hose just happens to spring a leak at the same time he's in a hospital

195
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,700
for a totally unrelated problem.

196
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Fjodor. It's Fedir.

197
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
If low testosterone means I can't get sick with something else,

198
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,400
then punch me in the junk right now. I would, if it weren't redundant.

199
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Is Fedir the one who married Mykola?

200
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Mykola is Dominika's uncle.

201
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,700
How is it you can retain every detail of our habits and personal lives,

202
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,100
and none of this?

203
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,000
'Cause I find it hard to remember things I don't give a crap about.

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,100
Ergo, Dominika has one brother, and his name is Al.

205
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,700
Maybe the testicular damage set the stage for something worse.

206
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,100
Multiple Sclerosis causes incontinence, and progresses faster in men with low T.

207
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,300
<i>Way to stay on point.</i>

208
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,400
It's that kind of leadership that's putting you at the head of the pack.

209
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,300
There is no pack. She's the only applicant.

210
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,300
Well, that's settled, then.

211
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,900
Have your underlings do an LP and get 
a cranio-spinal MRI

212
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,200
to check for plaques associated with M.S.

213
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,700
I will go tell Foreman about your promotion.

214
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,500
Wait.

215
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,400
<i>So nobody cares about the job till I apply, and suddenly</i>

216
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,000
it's the last limited-edition lightsaber at Comic-Con.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Just seems like it should go to someone with more... Seniority.

218
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,900
Meaning you. I said "more," not "most. "

219
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,100
Meaning you or Taub. House is a dictator.

220
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,000
Second in command 
is a meaningless position. Doesn't look meaningless on my resume.

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,100
Doesn't have to be meaningless at all.

222
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,600
The right person could turn it into something. Get the department running smoothly.

223
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,300
I wonder who that "right person" could be. House is the head of the department.

224
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,800
It's only fair that a woman should hold the other position of authority.

225
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Yeah, let's go affirmative action on this, because then I'll definitely win.

226
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
This is what House wants.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,700
Wind us up and watch us fight over an empty title, 
which would make us extra stupid

228
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,400
because of what we've just been through.

229
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,300
We should let him choose whoever he wants and move on.

230
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,700
So if these proteins are in my spinal fluid, that means I have M.S.?

231
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,900
Proteins may indicate M.S. There's no one definitive test.

232
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,400
That's why Dr. House ordered an MRI as well.

233
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,600
<i>This is anesthetic.</i>

234
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,800
<i>It's a scary diagnosis.</i>

235
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,500
But advances are being made.

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,700
Several drugs approved just this year.

237
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,800
To be honest, at the moment, I'm feeling
 a little more worried <i>about the testosterone injections.</i>

238
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,900
<i>It's making me feel, uh, different.</i>

239
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,300
Just kind of amped.

240
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,900
I went through this big life change, and it felt really...

241
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,900
Meaningful.

242
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,900
But what if it was all just chemistry?

243
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,800
Loss of testosterone could have been a factor,

244
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,000
but think of it as a catalyst.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
<i>It got you to reevaluate. Now you know what's important.</i>

246
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,100
You can choose to hold onto that.

247
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Right?

248
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,100
It's certainly worth trying.

249
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Deep breath, stay very still.

250
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,500
Just tell House to drop the whole team leader thing
. That's the only way it'll go away.

251
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
I don't think it's such a bad idea.

252
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,000
A little more structure in your department couldn't hurt.

253
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,500
Yeah.

254
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,800
House is doing this because of his great love of structure,

255
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,900
not because he wants us to turn on each other.

256
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,400
So don't do that.

257
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,300
It makes sense to have someone in there with a little more accountability.

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,300
As long as it's not Adams.

259
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,900
She sees the whole thing as an opportunity to remake the department in her image.

260
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,300
Or Park, for obvious reasons.

261
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,300
And Taub's got the kids. He's pretty busy.

262
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Are you seriously angling

263
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,400
for a job that you mocked its fate the whole time I had it?

264
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,700
I don't want the job.

265
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,200
You just don't want anyone else to have it.

266
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,000
This'll be great.

267
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Your grandmother's kind of sexy.

268
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,200
That is Taras Shevchenko, the greatest Ukrainian poet.

269
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,200
Is he the guy behind "There once was a man from Kremenchuk"?

270
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,700
Help me move coffee table.

271
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,000
Well, then where will we have coffee?

272
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,400
And by "coffee" I mean scotch. Coffee and booze are artificial high for me.

273
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,300
High is in exercise.

274
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,800
Dance aerobics. Fun, and good for the butt.

275
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,600
Amy Grant?

276
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,900
<i>I know.</i> <i>But there's a hot girl</i>

277
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
jumping up and down in my living room, so...

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,400
You have a limited amount of time

279
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
to learn a ton of uninteresting facts.

280
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,100
Welcome to my wheelhouse.

281
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
You brought a protractor?

282
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
You never know when you might need to make a pie chart.

283
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,000
Looks like someone <i>is currying favor for the team leader position.</i>

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,100
Yes.

285
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,000
We'll be using a basic alphabet technique

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
with a mnemonic multiplier.

287
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,300
In high school, they called me "The Bookie Monster. "

288
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,300
Pop quiz. Where did you get the candlesticks?

289
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,900
On three. One, two, three.

290
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,200
- Morocco. - Denver.

291
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,800
Drink up.

292
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
It's gonna be a long night.

293
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,900
You really think this guy's gonna hulk out once the hormones kick in?

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,800
Some male lizards do push-ups to attract mates.

295
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,700
When scientists gave them extra testosterone,

296
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
they did push-ups until they died.

297
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,400
Same drive you took advantage of to get Chase to carry a box of files down to your car yesterday.

298
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,000
Periventricular and subcortical white matter are clean.

299
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,400
So you're saying masculinity is ingrained and irrational.

300
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm saying it's pointless to try-

301
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,900
By extension, you're also saying femininity is enlightened and rational.

302
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,400
<i>It's the way we should all be,</i> guys just are incapable of it.

303
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,900
Brain stem and cord are clean.

304
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,500
<i>Is it okay if I scratch my nose?</i>

305
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,600
Go ahead.

306
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,100
Guess he doesn't have M.S.

307
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,500
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,200
Is it your hand? No, it's my eyes.

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,700
I'm-I'm seeing double.

310
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,000
<i>Smile. It's your honeymoon.</i>

311
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,000
So what causes double vision on top of all the other symptoms?

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,300
It's not a brain tumor or we would've seen it on the scans.

313
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,100
<i>Eye exam didn't offer anything conclusive.</i> Let's do some winter shots.

314
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,600
Wardrobe change. Thyroid eye disease in conjunction with Graves.

315
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,100
Thyroid level was normal.

316
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Check it out.

317
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,000
Simpson traded this in exchange
 for me helping out on some of my days off.

318
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,400
Quite the display of initiative and leadership.

319
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,500
But you're way too smart to fall for a blatant bribe like that.

320
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,900
Or a blatant flaunting of cleavage. Like those.

321
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,700
<i>What happened to not letting House get to you?</i>

322
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,200
You're like lemmings,

323
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,900
marching off the cliff of competitive humiliation.

324
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,200
All I'm doing is my job. <i>House has indicated that he considers me attractive.</i>

325
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,000
There's nothing wrong with me using my strengths to my advantage.

326
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,100
<i>With an argument like that,</i> maybe you should just drop down to your knees and-

327
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,900
I mean, unless that's not your strength.

328
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Oh, big hug, big man. It's cold out here.

329
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,500
<i>At the risk of derailing</i> this very productive photo shoot and bickering session,

330
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,000
what about myasthenia gravis?

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,300
<i>Extra-ocular muscle weakness leads to double vision,</i> atonic bladder leads to incontinence.

332
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,800
Could've been triggered when his T got really low.

333
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,100
Ooh, a little one.

334
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,500
He'd be a good pick.

335
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,900
<i>Smooth.</i>

336
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,300
<i>You let the rest of them compete,</i>

337
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,400
tear each other to pieces, then you swoop in with a save.

338
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,300
<i>Start the patient on IVIG and plasmapheresis.</i>

339
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,400
Can you handle that, please?

340
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,200
I need a minute.

341
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,500
<i>Well, make it quick.</i> We're doin' Memphis.

342
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,300
You think you want this, but it's a bad idea.

343
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,400
I was gonna go Dollywood, but I'm not sure I could off that wig.

344
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,100
Everybody was playing nice,

345
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,600
and in your world, nice doesn't solve cases,

346
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,300
but after what happened, a little bonding is a good thing.

347
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,500
We still have ideas, we still argue.

348
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,000
Maybe it could work better if we appreciate each other.

349
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,700
That was impressive.

350
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,500
You said that whole thing without once moving your lips.

351
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
The ones you're not moving.

352
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,900
Oh. I get it.

353
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,100
I won't play along with your stupid games, so I'm no longer a man.

354
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,900
Clever.

355
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,000
Actually, you won't play along with my stupid games because you're no longer a man.

356
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,300
Still clever, though.

357
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,600
Studies have shown that raising kids lowers testosterone levels in men.

358
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,100
The more involved you are, the lower it gets.

359
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,400
Right. Having kids has neutered me.

360
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Or maybe it's helped me finally grow up.

361
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,300
How are you feeling?

362
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,600
As long as I keep my eyes closed, pretty good.

363
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
Really good, actually.

364
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,900
I got energy, I feel confident, clear.

365
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,700
Testosterone does tend to perk you up.

366
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
Hey, Hon. I brought you a burger.

367
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,600
Really? You're in the hospital. Eat whatever you want.

368
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,700
You're the best wife ever.

369
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,700
And I'm not just saying that because of how great your ass looks in those jeans.

370
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,500
<i>I'm sorry. That was-</i>

371
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,300
No, it's okay. Girl likes to know she's appreciated.

372
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,100
Come here.

373
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,600
So I think we should talk to Leading Lights about seminars and DVDs.

374
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,400
Are you sure? You were worried about the commitment.

375
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, there's no point in being in business with them halfway.

376
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,300
You okay with that? It's good to finally have a decision.

377
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Okay.

378
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,500
<i>Fedir is the brother she worries about the most.</i>

379
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,200
Ever since Luba passed.

380
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,800
Sorry.

381
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,600
But this is the closest we could find to the cold, soulless offices of a government bureaucracy.

382
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
If you're not using your office, I will.

383
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Does Dominika still communicate with her high school friends? <i>Uh, Vasyl, yes.</i>

384
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,500
Oksana, no. Not since she kissed Pavlo.

385
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,800
'Cause that bitch knew that Dominika liked him.

386
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,100
Wrong.

387
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,900
Oh, Oksana is a slut. Dead to me.

388
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,000
The right answer is the wrong answer.

389
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,500
<i>No husband would pay that much attention</i> to his wife's friend dramas.

390
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,700
Haven't you been divorced three times?

391
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,100
In-between those divorces, I was married, non-fraudulently,

392
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,800
<i>for 12 years total,</i>

393
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,000
<i>which is 12 years longer than anyone in this room.</i>

394
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,800
Move.

395
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,500
So are you going for this team leader thing?

396
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,700
Probably. You deserve it.

397
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,000
You have way more experience than me. You're giving up?

398
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,200
I wish.

399
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,800
I still have a lot of med school debt,

400
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
and my parents need help with their mortgage.

401
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,300
So I could kinda use the money.

402
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,100
As of an hour ago, I'm just seeing one of everything. Looks like you guys were right-

403
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,400
We'll be right back.

404
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,400
"I could use the money"? You want to game me, you gotta do better than that.

405
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,800
- Chase- - You want to be a leader, you have to know how to manipulate.

406
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,200
You can't just spill-

407
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,500
I think the whites of his eyes were yellow.

408
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,200
Everything okay? Jaundice.

409
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,600
There's something wrong with your liver.

410
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,900
Liver function tests confirm his enzymes are totally out of whack.

411
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,100
So much for myasthenia gravis. Can we hurry this up?

412
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,600
I have a government to defraud at noon. If you need to leave, you should.

413
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm fairly confident our patient's got sarcoidosis.

414
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,000
<i>Wow, you said that with so much authority.</i> Did anyone else get chills?

415
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,200
Just until I realized our patient has no sign of parenchymal lung abnormalities,

416
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
<i>which makes sarcoidosis a long shot.</i>

417
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,700
And bookkeeping isn't gonna get you any farther than boobs.

418
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,900
Though in fairness, the boobs were really, really helping.

419
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,600
<i>I still think it's myasthenia gravis.</i> Did you miss the recap?

420
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,100
We treated for that. The liver tanked. But his vision got better.

421
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,500
Liver problems could be a sign of celiac.

422
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
He's been back on gluten since he's been in the hospital. Yesterday he had a burger.

423
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,500
That would've kicked the celiac into gear, causing the liver problems.

424
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,100
So your theory is that he has two unrelated diseases.

425
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,200
And he's already got low testosterone.

426
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,300
I seem to remember something about House hating coincidences. It's true.

427
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,100
<i>I think it's Lyme Disease.</i>

428
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,300
One single disease named "Lyme. " Without a rash.

429
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,500
10% of cases present without a rash.

430
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,500
Lyme Disease it is. Start the patient on antibiotics.

431
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,700
Now I have to get home before my fake wife gets real annoyed.

432
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,100
Something bothering you? I asked the nurse for an extra pillow.

433
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,500
That was half an hour ago. Sorry.

434
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,700
Things can get pretty hectic. It was a pillow.

435
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,200
I mean, how hard can a pil-

436
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
listen to me. I'm being a jerk.

437
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,200
Testosterone can give you a shorter temper even when you're not sick.

438
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,500
You noticed and adjusted. That's a good thing.

439
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Just got a call from our lawyer.

440
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,900
You changed our counter to leading lights?

441
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,500
You deserve proper billing and a salary bump in the second term.

442
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,000
We talked about this. We decided it wasn't worth potentially blowing the deal.

443
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,700
It'll be fine.

444
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,400
I've got to get some work done.

445
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,100
These are such pretty flowers you buy for me <i>every Friday, 

446
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,000
from Japanese florist,</i> on corner of Edison and Conway.

447
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,400
Just one more thing.

448
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,300
With this ring, I thee wedded.

449
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,200
You left it here when you skipped town with your boyfriend.

450
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,000
You kept the rings.

451
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Actually, I tried to trade them to a hooker for unspecified favors,

452
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,300
but it turns out she doesn't accept zinc.

453
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,100
Like modern fairytale.

454
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,400
Dr. and Mrs. Gregory House? Yeah.

455
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,800
Nate Weinmann. U.S. Immigration.

456
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,700
Welcome to our home.

457
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,400
Give him time.

458
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
When I was 14, there was a girl I wanted to impress,

459
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,700
so I jumped off the roof of her house. Broke my ankle.

460
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,500
Joe's basically going through puberty.

461
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,600
It'll take him a while to adjust.

462
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I- I tracked down a video from one of Joe's business coaching seminars

463
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,600
from before I knew him.

464
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,900
<i>I'm hearing a lot about the value of compromise.</i>

465
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,700
<i>We don't live on Sesame Street.</i>

466
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,300
We live in the real world, the business world.

467
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,900
If you're not a winner, you're a loser.

468
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
<i>If you aren't comfortable with that,</i>

469
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,800
go open a pottery studio.

470
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,600
I never would have gone out with the guy in this video.

471
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,500
Uh, do you remember the last time she visited Vasyl?

472
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,200
Uh, let me see, that would be...

473
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,700
August?

474
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,400
No. No, July.

475
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,600
'Cause I remember it was right after our half-anniversary,

476
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,800
and I forgot to put a gift in her suitcase.

477
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,000
And... I've never heard the end of that one.

478
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,100
House specialty.

479
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,500
I made up this pun.

480
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,600
Is it- Thank you. Mm-hmm.

481
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,900
Honey, why do you do this to me? You know I'm watching my weight.

482
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,600
Then maybe you'll stop eating cheese in front of open fridge in middle of the night.

483
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,200
<i>This is delicious.</i> Thank you.

484
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,300
So everything looks good in here.

485
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,800
I'm just gonna step out and get a corroborating interview from one of the neighbors.

486
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,000
Neighbors? It's-it's middle of the day.

487
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,700
<i>I- I-I think everybody's at work.</i> Yeah, then they're at work.

488
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,000
I just got a form to check off,

489
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and you will be on your way to permanent status.

490
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,500
<i>'Scuse me, sir.</i> Do you have a minute?

491
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,600
How can I help you? Do you know Dr. and Mrs. House?

492
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,100
Of course, they've been my neighbors <i>about two years, now.</i>

493
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,400
<i>Lovely couple.</i> I see them almost every night.

494
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,000
They seem always to be together. Great, well, thanks for your help.

495
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,200
Cheerio.

496
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,800
Hey, what're you doing? That's my door.

497
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Handing out menus for a new Chinese place.

498
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,800
You're that guy that plays noisy video games

499
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,500
with House on Saturday nights.

500
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,300
There's a simple explanation.

501
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,300
Be at my office tomorrow at 10:00.

502
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,100
The patient's shown zero improvement. Because he's only been on the antibiotics overnight.

503
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,600
Or because he doesn't have Lyme Disease.

504
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,500
Where are you? <i>Oh, just chillin'.</i>

505
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,200
<i>U.S. citizenship at immigration.</i>

506
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,300
<i>Waiting on my fraud interview with my wife and my attorney.</i>

507
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,000
- No big. - House.

508
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,500
Hang up.

509
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,700
<i>I still think it's myasthenia gravis plus celiac.</i>

510
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,000
His change in diet has to be significant.

511
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,200
We just need to do an intestinal biopsy to confirm.

512
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,400
With his low platelet count, a biopsy puts him at risk for an abdominal bleed, which puts him at risk of death.

513
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,000
Either you're done, or you're walking in there without a lawyer.

514
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,800
I know, it sounds like a phone,

515
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
but it's a timer to remind me to pee before our meeting.

516
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,900
Hello, old chap. You need to save yourself.

517
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,200
<i>I was up last night</i> <i>trying to find another angle, but I can't.</i>

518
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Tell immigration you were in love with Dominika, but your marriage fell apart,

519
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
and that's why you haven't been living together.

520
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,800
She'll be deported permanently.

521
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,200
<i>House, I know you like Dominika,</i> you have fun with her, but you got caught.

522
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,300
There's no getting out of this.

523
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,000
<i>The best you could hope for is that you don't go back to jail.</i>

524
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,100
Tell my team to- to skip the biopsy

525
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,100
and give the antibiotics more time.

526
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
They're ready for us.

527
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,700
I drew a line in the sand, and I won.

528
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,900
We should be celebrating. Do you need a few minutes?

529
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,300
You're right. I keep getting better.

530
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,800
That's just it. You won.

531
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,500
You made a demand that could've blown up the deal, and you never even asked me.

532
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Deal didn't blow up. They caved.

533
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,600
Joe, you say it in your seminars. Process matters just as much as results.

534
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,900
Are you seriously busting my chops because I made one little move without you?

535
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,300
How 'bout stepping aside and letting me

536
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,000
be the man in this relationship for a change?

537
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,900
I really can't talk to you right now.

538
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,600
<i>I don't know why I said that.</i>

539
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Just-I got so angry.

540
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,700
<i>Hopefully after this dose,</i>

541
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,200
<i>you'll start to feel better, and we can get you home.</i>

542
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,900
But I'd like to do one more test.

543
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,800
The testimony of one angry, nearsighted neighbor

544
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,500
shouldn't outweigh all other evidence.

545
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,600
Photos, utility bills- Yes, because your clients would never fake anything.

546
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,800
Uh, we acknowledge the neighbor thing was a mistake,

547
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,500
but that doesn't mean that all of the other documentation should just be thrown out.

548
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,700
Look, look, you know, I get that it's your job to try to act like there's a case here, but shut up.

549
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,800
Okay.

550
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,800
USCIS will be denying Miss Petrova's green card application.

551
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,100
You'll be referred to immigration court for deportation proceedings,

552
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,400
and we're gonna inform your parole officer <i>about evidence of fraud.</i>

553
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,500
So unless anybody has anything else to add...

554
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,600
Please, I am begging, do not send him back to jail.

555
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,300
Maybe we have not lived together all these-
Mrs. House, I have to advise you not to continue.

556
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,900
This man and I, did we marry for love?

557
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
No.

558
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,300
<i>But this past week,</i>

559
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,600
we have a lot of fun.

560
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,200
Working really hard to fool the U.S. government, right? Don't answer that.

561
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,500
Way ahead of you.

562
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,300
It was fake, but...

563
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,900
It felt real.

564
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,500
Maybe because it become real.

565
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,800
This man...

566
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,500
My husband.

567
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,500
I want to stay with him, but if I cannot,

568
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,800
please send me away, and let him be free.

569
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,400
I love him.

570
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,800
I didn't buy a word you said.

571
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,400
But a judge might.

572
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,600
I'm gonna let you stay.

573
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,100
But for the next six months, I'm gonna hold onto this file,

574
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,900
and our investigators are gonna show up unannounced at 6:00 a. m., 11:00 at night, 

575
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,200
and they better find <i>the two of you sitting on the couch watching NCIS</i>

576
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,600
eating ice cream from the same spoon.

577
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,800
Or both of you will be sent to places

578
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,100
far less pleasant than New Jersey.

579
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,800
What you just said in there... Don't worry.

580
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,400
I'm much too smart to be falling in love with you.

581
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,700
I will be needing extra shelf in bathroom.

582
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,000
Abdominal biopsy showed flattened villi.

583
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,500
Looks like you were right about celiac.

584
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,700
You do remember Chase got stabbed doing a test House didn't order?

585
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,300
Good comparison, since both patients were tweaked on steroids.

586
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,400
You only did this to score points over Chase and Park.

587
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,100
We were right.

588
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,300
I proved it, and the patient didn't bleed out.
Why are you being a jerk about this?

589
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,500
Let's go see if House is back.

590
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,100
Patient's having trouble breathing.

591
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,000
So much for celiac.

592
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,700
<i>His breathing is stabilized,</i>

593
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,400
but his lung function is at 60%, and his liver is tanking.

594
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,800
And he has major symptoms of celiac without actually having celiac.

595
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,900
Could be Whipple's.

596
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,100
Doesn't explain the incontinence.

597
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,400
<i>Intestinal lymphoma?</i>

598
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,500
Doesn't explain the double vision.

599
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Any time you want to jump in.

600
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,400
Is dance aerobics even a thing?

601
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,400
I hear it's good for the butt. <i>What about a parasitic infection?</i>

602
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,500
Strongyloides is known to damage the small intestine.

603
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,000
In this country, he's about as likely to get that as win Powerball.

604
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
Someone does win Powerball. Every week.

605
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,900
The patient went to Puerto Rico a few months ago. One of the few places in the U.S.

606
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,600
You could pick up Strongyloides. Treatment is Ivermectin.

607
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,400
We give that to someone with liver problems,

608
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
he could have seizures, or worse.

609
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,600
Do it.

610
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,300
I'm hearing a lot about the value of compromise.

611
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,700
<i>But we don't live on Sesame Street,</i> <i>we live in the real-</i>

612
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,400
I was wondering if maybe we overlooked a symptom,

613
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,600
or something.
Makes perfect sense.

614
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,400
If you're the patient, and "pantywaist" is the symptom.

615
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,900
Adams and I both thought the patient could have celiac,

616
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,500
but only she was willing to go out on a limb and run the test.

617
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,800
I gave up.

618
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,300
Now you're in here watching a motivational speech.

619
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Even your attempt to get your balls back lacks balls.

620
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,700
<i>- World, the business world.</i>

621
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,100
If you're not a winner, you're a loser.

622
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,200
<i>His voice-it's lower than it is now.</i>

623
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,500
If only there was a good reason for a professional speaker to be hoarse.

624
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Go open a pottery studio.

625
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,900
Good point.

626
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,000
It's not a good point. It's a decent point.

627
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You're doing it again. You have any other videos?

628
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,700
<i>Other seminars?</i> - a cupple

629
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,200
When you see a weakness,

630
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,000
<i>that's a time for strength.</i>

631
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,900
<i>A lot of people say, "Oh, I feel bad about it.</i> <i>The other guy made a mistake. "</i>

632
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,700
You bailed too early. Now I get all the credit.

633
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,900
<i>That kind of thinking is what makes you have a bad day.</i>

634
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,700
Chronic hoarseness <i>is a symptom of a condition called</i> silent thyroiditis.

635
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,700
- But I'm not hoarse. - Exactly.

636
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,300
But you were three years ago. Silent thyroiditis comes and goes.

637
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,900
And it, in turn, is a symptom of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 3,

638
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,300
which makes this a really bad idea.

639
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,900
PAS 3 attacks the body's own endocrine system,

640
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,600
<i>moving from gland to gland.</i>

641
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,900
<i>It started in the thyroid,</i> <i>and probably helped along by your low testosterone,</i>

642
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,800
<i>moved on to the gut.</i>

643
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,200
<i>Where it caused celiac disease,</i> or it would've if you weren't on a gluten-free diet.

644
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
I was right.

645
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,400
This is incredibly relevant.

646
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,200
<i>Eventually, PAS 3 attacked your thymus gland.</i>

647
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,300
You developed myasthenia gravis, which landed you in here,

648
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,800
and you started eating gluten, which only made things worse.

649
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,200
So am I gonna be okay?

650
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
<i>We'll treat the various conditions</i> with high-dose steroids.

651
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
<i>Assuming they respond, you should be fine.</i>

652
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,100
And the testosterone?

653
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,600
Kicked in the nuts is kicked in the nuts.

654
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,300
<i>Over the past week,</i>

655
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,600
<i>you've all had good moments and bad.</i>

656
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,200
No one candidate has prevailed.

657
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,100
And so now, we embark upon a contest

658
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,700
of medical strength, stamina, and skill.

659
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,000
Can we just get this over with?

660
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,100
<i>If the competitor representing Australia</i> would like to take a point deduction, he should,

661
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,200
by all means, continue yapping.

662
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,700
Your glee is on the verge of making this not worth it for any of us.

663
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
Can I at least light the torch?

664
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,800
Hurry.

665
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,800
I declare open the games of the number one, number two competition.

666
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,500
<i>Je declare ouvert-</i> all right. Ready, set, suture!

667
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,500
T time.

668
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,000
What happens if I don't take it?

669
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Or at least go to a much lower dose? Are you having side effects?

670
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,200
No, I feel great. Faster, clearer.

671
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
More like myself.

672
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,900
But my marriage and my career,

673
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,300
they're both built on me being somebody else.

674
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,400
Low testosterone can cause depression and problems sleeping.

675
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,900
It's also been linked to conditions such as osteoporosis and diabetes.

676
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,500
It'll make your life harder and more dangerous on top of all the meds you'll be taking.

677
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,800
I'll take that risk.

678
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,500
I'm a better man without it.

679
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,700
Well, this certainly has brought more structure to the department.

680
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,900
Really, I'm just excited for the wheelchair race.

681
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,500
You were smart not to enter. Never in, never lose.

682
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,100
And since you no longer have stones.

683
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,400
I'll split the 50 a week with you.

684
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,100
Deal.

685
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,400
Honey, I'm home!

686
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:18,700
