1
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:09,148
How long has your daughter had trouble breathing?

2
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:10,812
About a week now.

3
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:14,452
The best dads wait two or more.

4
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:17,036
Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious.

5
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:20,234
I-I checked online, and it's... Asthma or something.

6
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:24,364
<i>"Or something"</i> is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree.

7
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,163
When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?

8
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:27,960
Uh, like five months ago.

9
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:32,203
We went a clinic in Trenton. I had strep throat. You remember the antibiotic they gave you?

10
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:34,845
Is it neomycin? <i>Amoxicillin.</i>

11
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:41,183
So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was--

12
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:42,426
Sorry!

13
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,021
<i>Hospital policy</i> specifically prohibits me from giving meds

14
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:49,272
to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter.

15
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:53,171
Your pants are a size too short, <i>so either you grew</i> <i>a couple of inches</i>

16
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,417
or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store.

17
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:57,840
And only you have dimples, which are adorable,

18
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,943
but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait.

19
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:03,450
Which actually doesn't prove anything.

20
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:07,397
<i>The fact that she didn't</i> <i>burst into tears tells me</i> that you never thought he was your dad.

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,034
Let's get out of here.

22
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:13,979
<i>Since you're the brains</i> <i>of the operation,</i> might wanna stick around.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,869
What, so I can get busted by Social Services?

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,009
No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear.

25
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,572
It's usually a sign of a skull fracture.

26
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:26,403
<i>Someone been using your head</i> <i>as a soccer ball?</i>

27
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:29,912
No. Much as I'd like to take your word for it,

28
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:32,226
I have no interest in taking your word for it.

29
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,929
No tenderness, no pain.

30
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:39,056
Looks like you might actually be telling the truth about something.

31
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,146
Ear canal is fine.

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,706
You don't have a fever. Pay the man.

33
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:52,970
He's late for a trashcan fire.

34
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,259
Would you--would you tell me what's going on?

35
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,307
What's wrong with me? I have no idea.

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,103

豪斯医生 第八季第10集</font>

时间轴：荒川小白脸</font>

39
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:50,629
<i>Why'd you ask to meet us</i> 30 miles away from the hospital?

40
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:55,544
Because I can.

41
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,941
Also, Chris Christie's blog says the pancakes here are the best.

42
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:03,437
So...what do we got on this 18-year-old

43
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:05,390
with the ear bleed and the breathing problems?

44
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:09,551
CT confirms no skull fracture, and looking at her confirms she's not 18.

45
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:11,039
Yes, she is.

46
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:11,926
Says so in the file.

47
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:16,220
We can't treat an underage patient without a guardian-- we need to call Social Services.

48
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:19,597
I cut a deal with the patient. We don't call, she doesn't bolt.

49
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,764
<i>Whatever age,</i> <i>living on the street</i> makes her vulnerable to malnutrition,

50
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:25,376
drug use, H.I.V., all things which could explain her symptoms.

51
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:29,806
No sign of malnutrition. Tox screen is clear. S.T.D. panel was negative.

52
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:32,489
And...is that Foreman?

53
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,773
Oh, my goodness, it is! Hi, Dean Foreman!

54
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,965
Are you not gonna introduce us because we're married?

55
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,960
Oh, no, wait-- that's her.

56
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,749
She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.

57
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,090
<i>In a restaurant</i> <i>that's nowhere near your home</i> or the hospital.

58
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,326
Chris Christie recommends the pancakes.

59
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:10,759
<i>Squamous cell</i> <i>middle ear tumor could have</i> caused the ear bleed.

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,116
Paraneoplastic reaction caused the breathing problems.
Middle ear looks completely normal.

61
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:16,589
But there is thickening in the lining of the wall of the third ventricle.

62
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,900
<i>Could be a sign</i> <i>of cerebral infection.</i>
<i>Would explain</i> <i>the lack of fever.</i>

63
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,600
Pneumococcus is pretty common <i>among the homeless</i> <i>population.</i>

64
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,161
We should find out if she's been vaccinated.

65
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:27,323
Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything,

66
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:30,114
start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.

67
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:33,367
And if she says she has been vaccinated?

68
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:36,159
Then don't believe her, and start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,543
How about we don't believe she's gonna bolt and we call Social Services?

70
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:43,830
While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.

71
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:49,615
The bathroom's that way. Pretty sure there's one in the hospital.

72
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,451
When I was your age, I ran away.

73
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,788
Lived on my own.

74
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,720
- At the time, it seemed-- - Oh, let me guess.

75
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,106
Life with mom and dad was kind of a drag.

76
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:10,517
So you just ran away, lived with friends, and partied with guys

77
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,736
that you knew your parents would hate.

78
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:16,040
And then when you got tired of being a rebel, you just went home.

79
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:20,569
Being homeless isn't a vacation for me.

80
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,040
And I'm not acting out.

81
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:26,759
My life at home sucked, so I got the hell out of there.

82
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,557
There are other options besides living on the streets.

83
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:32,173
Right, like group homes, where you're packed in

84
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:35,283
with as many messed-up delinquent kids as possible,

85
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,673
foster parents who only take you in because you're a meal ticket.

86
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:40,463
I can think of easier ways to make 175 bucks a week.

87
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:44,008
No, you're right-- I really should roll the dice and hope for a pair that don't ruin my life

88
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,016
the way that my mom-- get your hands off my stuff!

89
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:50,592
The stuff might tell us more about why you're sick. A history textbook. You go to school?

90
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:53,127
I don't plan on being homeless forever.

91
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:01,583
Hello, good sir. My brother, the General here,

92
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:03,900
gots the green-apple quickstep.

93
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:11,823
One of us is in the wrong time zone.

94
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:12,833
<i>And if it's me,</i> <i>I need to talk</i>

95
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:17,684
to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order.

96
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:21,255
Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.

97
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,551
<i>It's hardly</i> <i>authentic,</i> coming to a newfangled clinic,

98
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,852
especially with a Yankee doctor.

99
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:31,672
Sir, are you questioning my resolve?

100
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:33,705
Yes, and your sanity.

101
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:35,695
<i>I'm multitasking.</i>

102
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,400
Uh, General... You're not allowed out.

103
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:41,189
We swore that we would see the elephant together.

104
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,904
Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs

105
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,633
and their "elephant."

106
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,024
I could add some Mercury, if you want to make it more authentic.

107
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:02,663
The Confederacy thanks you, Doc.

108
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,536
Got House's phone.

109
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:18,126
Deleted all photos of you and Anita.

110
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:20,741
- I owe you. - An affair?

111
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:23,807
Never knew you were such a tramp. Neither did I.

112
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:27,350
Anita, she's fun, smart.

113
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,450
Not looking for anything serious. It's--it's... Pretty perfect.

114
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,164
Except for the annoying guilt about the husband.

115
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,704
The lies she must be telling him.

116
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,097
<i>But not guilty enough</i> to stop seeing her.

117
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:42,273
<i>She's smoking hot,</i> and it's not his job to protect her marriage.

118
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:45,435
Aren't you supposed to be pointing a finger at your own life as a cautionary tale?

119
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:48,354
If not for cheating, I might still have a wife,

120
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:51,016
but I wouldn't have Sophie and Sophia.

121
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:55,176
Which means I wouldn't be preparing for their visit this week

122
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:59,184
by child locking all my cabinets, padding table corners,

123
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:02,969
and getting rid of every single magazine.

124
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,554
You could probably just hide the porn in your underwear drawer.

125
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:09,871
Magazines go away so I won't ignore my children.

126
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:14,407
I know I have to pay attention to them.
I want to pay attention to them,

127
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:16,921
but they're just so...

128
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,467
Boring.

129
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,714
Did you learn anything at Jane Doe's school?

130
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:31,252
<i>They did a bunch</i> <i>of vaccinations,</i> <i>including pneumococcus.</i>

131
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:34,508
<i>Take her off</i> <i>the Ceftriaxone.</i> So we're back to square none?

132
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,731
<i>Not exactly.</i> The name she registered under seems to be fake,

133
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:41,530
but the address is a foreclosed house. <i>We'll let you know</i> <i>what we find.</i>

134
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,008
Plenty of food, water. And beer.

135
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,037
<i>She eats well.</i> Goes to school and makes good grades.

136
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:52,491
<i>She's a homeless girl</i> who's captain of the volleyball team.

137
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:54,203
<i>How can you</i> <i>be okay with this?</i>

138
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:58,797
Your mom sends you to work with snacks.
I want and need parents.

139
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:01,861
<i>Jane Doe is flourishing</i> <i>without them.</i>
<i>Maybe.</i>

140
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:06,644
But this mold definitely is.

141
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,946
You went to my school. Now that they know, they'll report me.

142
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:13,078
I can't go back there!

143
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:16,195
You may have a fungal infection. You need that medicine.

144
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:19,112
Fluconazole, right? I'll get it at a clinic.

145
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,634
I can't feel my legs.

146
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:27,662
Hey, wha-- is that the infection? I don't think so.

147
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:35,389
So...What causes an ear bleed, breathing problems,

148
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,547
and our runaway's inability to run away?

149
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,855
Fungal infection's off the table.

150
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:45,209
<i>What about</i> <i>transverse myelitis?</i> Not with normal posterior column function.

151
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:48,218
I've been waiting to do this for months. Pull!

152
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,722
Sights seem to be off on this.

153
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:00,411
We didn't call Social Services before <i>because we didn't want</i> <i>the patient to take off.</i>

154
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:03,210
Now she can't--there's no reason for us not to call.

155
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:07,762
Well, how about the reason that there's no reason? This is working fine for me.

156
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:09,139
Pull!

157
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,563
Well, now, that one clearly took evasive action.

158
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:17,852
<i>You want to protect her</i> because you think she's fine on her own, outside the system.

159
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:20,957
Does anyone have a position on our patient's <i>medical</i> condition?

160
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,679
Could be endocarditis with septic emboli. Pull!

161
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:30,769
I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss.

162
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,739
There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes.

163
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,192
You've never done this before, have you?

164
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:36,912
No, I have not.

165
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:40,883
But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.

166
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:43,118
Vasculitis fits.

167
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,591
Start treatment with steroids.

168
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,201
She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again.

169
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:53,521
<i>Not once I call</i> <i>Social Services.</i> I'm not giving up.

170
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,164
You wanna bet?

171
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:59,699
One shot, one birdie. You hit, you make the call.

172
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,007
You miss, never mention it again. No.

173
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:03,770
Why would I agree?

174
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:07,650
'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.

175
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,897
Pull!

176
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,602
<i>She responding</i> <i>to corticosteroids?</i>

177
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,698
Looks like it. And Social Services.

178
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,547
I thought for sure there'd be some yelling or profanity, possible bloodletting.

179
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:54,037
<i>She's tired of living</i> <i>on the streets after all.</i>

180
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:57,061
<i>I'll bet House re...gret...</i>

181
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:03,028
Could he know I'm good with a gun?

182
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:05,980
I don't know how, but...

183
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:10,736
Hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?

184
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:13,251
She took a bet that she knew she'd win.

185
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:17,543
Frankly, I feel violated. What happened to the social worker I called?

186
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:22,291
Apparently, someone identifying themselves as Dr. Pujols called and said the patient ran off.

187
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,409
<i>Come on.</i> "Poo holes."

188
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,816
<i>I've informed</i> <i>Social Services</i> of the mistake and given Jane Doe's description to the cops.

189
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,307
They'll track down the parents. Thank you.

190
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:37,819
I'll leave you and Dr. "Pujols" alone.

191
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:38,697
You should have told me

192
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:42,465
you were treating an underage clinic patient. I was giving you the gift of deniability.

193
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:45,383
Now I'm giving you the gift of additional clinic hours.

194
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:46,849
No, you're not.

195
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,049
You've got nothing on me. Check your phone.

196
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:56,646
Uh...my phone? Oh, right. Yes, I--

197
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:59,268
I did have some pictures on that.

198
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:01,449
But...

199
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:04,344
I also have these.

200
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:08,181
There's the two of you kissing over dinner.

201
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:13,174
Busting a move in a night club. Is that your hand near her nether regions?

202
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:17,983
<i>Thanks again for taking off</i> <i>the ankle bracelet.</i>

203
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:20,653
I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House. Oh, of course not.

204
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:21,971
<i>There's no way</i> <i>someone of your integrity</i>

205
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:27,559
would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip.

206
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,741
<i>But what about</i> <i>compromising it</i> in a minor way?

207
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,855
Reduced clinic hours. Unlimited Internet porn budget.

208
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,795
<i>That makes much more sense</i>

209
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:39,984
than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives.

210
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,546
You can keep these. I got copies.

211
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:57,576
How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the man.

212
00:13:57,576 --> 00:14:00,490
Adams is right. You're protecting this girl.

213
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:02,899
No, I was wrong.

214
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,080
It's the stench of moralizing.

215
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:08,358
I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.

216
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,687
You admire this girl.

217
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:13,126
She had a horrible home life, so she went out on her own.

218
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:14,328
She's your road not taken.

219
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:17,281
I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned house with mold.

220
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:21,114
House, all I'm accusing you of is having a connection with a patient.

221
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,850
This is a good thing. It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.

222
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:26,034
It is a thing... which she'll prove

223
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:29,556
when her parents show up and you start protecting her from them.

224
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,149
The sound I make is,

225
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,849
moooo!

226
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:45,710
The sound I make is, quack quack quack quack quack.

227
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:11,804
Moo.

228
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,116
The sound is quack. Quack quack.

229
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:24,703
<i>Quack quack quack.</i>

230
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,952
I'm an ass.

231
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,211
On the plus side, I can now program my DVR

232
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:33,683
from my phone.

233
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:38,052
They are kind of boring. All kids, not just yours.

234
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:40,881
Very helpful. You need to log more hours.

235
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:43,295
Eventually, you'll pass boredom and get to bonding.

236
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:45,550
Kind of like Stockholm syndrome.

237
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:49,063
I heard the nurses talking. <i>You called Social Services</i> <i>for real.</i>

238
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,918
Because you shouldn't be living on your own.

239
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,063
Right, better my mom should use me as a punching bag.

240
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:58,642
If your mom abused you, Social Services won't let you go home with her.

241
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:00,233
Have I mentioned I don't trust the system?

242
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,334
We don't know if you're better yet. You can't just take off.

243
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,905
Uh, can we help you?

244
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:09,143
<i>I'm Adele Brown from</i> <i>Social Services, and this is--</i>

245
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:12,296
I'm Ellen Rogers. Callie's mother.

246
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:16,109
You haven't been that for two years. I promise...

247
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,809
Things are different.

248
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,655
Mom...two sentences in, and you're already making promises.

249
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:22,662
Okay, maybe we need to take a minute here and give Callie some space.

250
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:25,571
No, I don't need a minute. I need her out of my life.

251
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,196
Is she okay? I will be once you just...

252
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:30,902
Oh, my God!

253
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,146
<i>We need help in here!</i>

254
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:43,104
- Go! <i>- And they're off!</i>

255
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:45,171
You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?

256
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,193
I paid Mr. Chips 5 bucks to take a dive.

257
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:51,823
The bleeding stopped on its own.

258
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:55,010
<i>She got worse after</i> <i>being on steroids,</i> so autoimmune is out.

259
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:59,250
Diagnosis depends on whether the blood was coming from the sinuses, lungs, or her guts.

260
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,871
Mr. Chips looks like he wants it.

261
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:05,611
100 bucks says he'll make soup out of Franklin.

262
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:10,890
You're on. How'd the mom seem to you?

263
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:14,255
If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.

264
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:16,369
Move your ass, Mr. Chips!

265
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,437
Finish

266
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:39,256
You should have seen her face when mom walked in. Callie hates her. I don't think she's lying.

267
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,535
Because people never lie about people they hate.

268
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:43,040
<i>Big sinus bleed</i> <i>could be sinusitis</i>

269
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,729
<i>and a bleeding disorder.</i> She didn't complain about a headache.

270
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,473
The bleeding is in her gut. <i>Could be</i> <i>Zollinger-Ellison.</i>

271
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,383
<i>Acid reflux causes asthma,</i>

272
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:53,439
and the acid erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding.

273
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,931
Yes!

274
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,597
Franklin rules. Mr. Chips drools.

275
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:04,052
<i>Mr. Chips's owner only feeds</i> <i>him on apples and bananas.</i>

276
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:06,210
Nowhere near enough vitamin A. Pay up.

277
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,513
And do an upper endoscopy to confirm for Zollinger-Ellison,

278
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:11,705
after mommie dearest has given her permission.

279
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:16,000
Ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter. Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter.

280
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:19,850
Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter.

281
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:22,616
Good thing you made it all official.

282
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:29,786
Will the endoscopy be painful? Is that an issue?

283
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:34,507
It's a medical procedure. There will be some discomfort.

284
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:37,176
I never meant to hurt my daughter.

285
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:39,726
And yet you hit her.

286
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:44,278
She told you that? And now you're gonna tell me you didn't.

287
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:50,459
I'm a drug addict. And I've been a lousy mom.

288
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:54,781
Especially since my husband died.

289
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,353
I mean, he was closer to Callie than I was,

290
00:18:57,354 --> 00:19:00,793
and I missed him... So much.

291
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,940
And it was too hard.

292
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:05,742
And taking Oxy just...

293
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:07,633
made things easier.

294
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,274
Right up until it made me lose my daughter.

295
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:15,694
I hurt Callie a lot.

296
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:19,732
But one of the only things that I can feel okay about

297
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,526
is that I never hit her.

298
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,095
Didn't peg you as the midday fun kind of guy.

299
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:37,147
So glad I was wrong.

300
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:43,624
Ohh. Unfortunately, that's not why we're here.

301
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,519
Remember that guy from the restaurant yesterday?

302
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:56,135
He's got pictures of us. He's threatening to show your husband.

303
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:58,626
I thought you said that guy was one of your best doctors.

304
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:00,932
Yeah, not one of my best people.

305
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:04,998
We've gotta stop seeing each other.

306
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:10,299
Not necessarily. I told my husband about you.

307
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:14,487
What? Why?

308
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:16,725
He was saying that things had been better lately

309
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:20,088
between him and I, that I was happier.

310
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:22,074
I said that I was.

311
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:23,934
And that you were the reason.

312
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:28,538
And...He was okay with that? Not initially.

313
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:33,301
It was a pretty tough conversation. Neither of us is ready to give up on the marriage.

314
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:36,127
And I am not ready to give up this.

315
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:42,323
You don't have to feel so guilty anymore.

316
00:20:56,115 --> 00:21:00,060
You didn't need to shoot yourself. I could have given you a Section 8.

317
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:04,896
We've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb.

318
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,666
The gun slipped and-- I only had blanks in it, but...

319
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:11,713
It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.

320
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:16,276
Ah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Sheldon's a...Progressive.

321
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:19,179
Eh--compared to who? Rupert Murdoch?

322
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,213
Progressives are reenactors who strive for complete authenticity.

323
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,351
They never drop character while in uniform.

324
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,995
Whereas you just dabble in crazy.

325
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:32,399
<i>Sheldon and I had</i> <i>a big falling out</i> <i>years ago.</i>

326
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,294
<i>We only really started</i> talking again because of the reenactments.

327
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,702
They, uh...

328
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:41,504
Gave me my brother back. <i>That's a very moving story.</i>

329
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:46,011
Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.

330
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,203
Your mom didn't hit you, did she?

331
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:59,337
No. Then why'd you lie about it?

332
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:04,133
Because I wanted to get out of here.

333
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:07,305
People understand getting hit more than what my mom does.

334
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,005
Tell me. Maybe I'll understand.

335
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,165
Well, I was the mom.

336
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:19,780
She couldn't keep a job.

337
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:23,537
She'd spend all her money on pills. I had to get a job.

338
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:26,223
Double shifts, just to keep the power on.

339
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,008
Keep food in the house.

340
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,748
I couldn't tell you how many times she nearly O.D.ed

341
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,404
<i>and I had to clean her up</i> <i>and put her in bed.</i>

342
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,563
So I decided, if I was gonna be the grown-up, I'd rather do it on my own terms.

343
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,631
Your mom knows she messed up.

344
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,192
She's determined not to do it again.

345
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:55,651
Yeah.

346
00:22:56,673 --> 00:23:01,747
And she'll feel that way, right up until things get too tough and she has to start using again.

347
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,989
Do you think people can change? No.

348
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:16,366
But I don't think that's gonna change your opinion,

349
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:19,775
because... people don't change.

350
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,369
Stop.

351
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:26,634
<i>Is that an ulcer?</i> Yeah, it is.

352
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:29,684
But we haven't reached the stomach yet. I'm still high in the esophagus.

353
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,761
Means it's not Zollinger-Ellison.

354
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:34,330
<i>Ulcer's bleeding.</i>

355
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,139
We need to lavage before she drowns in her own blood.

356
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:43,366
Cauterized the ulcer, stopped the bleeding.

357
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:46,750
Compromised immune system from living on the street <i>could have made her</i> <i>susceptible to HPV.</i>

358
00:23:46,751 --> 00:23:49,431
HPV was covered on the STD panel. <i>She's negative.</i>

359
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,531
What if she didn't get this from being homeless?

360
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:55,221
What if she got it from her mom? I'm assuming you're thinking something genetic, because--

361
00:23:55,222 --> 00:23:58,508
I'm thinking addiction. Alcohol-induced esophagitis.

362
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:01,579
Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.

363
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,292
If only it would explain why we've never seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing.

364
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:07,823
Her blood pressure's been elevated. Could be the DTs.

365
00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:09,276
It's been mildly elevated.

366
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:13,261
Mildly elevated BP could put her at risk of a Berry aneurysm.

367
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:17,184
Weak blood vessel in the brain gets pounded on by elevated BP,

368
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:20,048
causes it to expand and contract.

369
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:22,102
<i>Causes the symptoms</i> <i>to come and go.</i>

370
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:25,951
CT didn't show any signs of an aneurysm. Did I mention they come and go?

371
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:29,862
Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood,

372
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:31,958
sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.

373
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:34,536
Alcoholism and Berry aneurysm are both valid theories.

374
00:24:34,537 --> 00:24:36,501
I think we should discuss this with the patient and her mom.

375
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:38,239
Why? We discussed it right here.

376
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,506
Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to locate the aneurysm,

377
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:43,438
then surgery to repair.

378
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,441
Brain surgery? When?

379
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,875
We booked the O.R. for an hour from now.

380
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:54,664
And Dr. House is sure that's what she has?

381
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:58,369
He's confident in the diagnosis. It's consistent with all of her symptoms.

382
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,161
But you don't buy it.

383
00:25:03,277 --> 00:25:04,457
No.

384
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,085
I think your symptoms are the result of alcohol abuse.

385
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:11,611
But I'm not-- I'm not an alcoholic.

386
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:14,964
You came to the hospital with beer in your pocket. We found more alcohol at your house.

387
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:18,251
Yeah, I use booze as payment. I have an occasional beer with my friends.

388
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:20,847
That doesn't mean I have a problem.

389
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:25,952
I want the surgery.

390
00:25:26,745 --> 00:25:29,162
Actually, it's your mom's decision.

391
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:38,944
I'm not an addict. That's what I always said to you, Callie,

392
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:41,805
but I had a problem-- I'm nothing like you!

393
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:47,449
Tell them to do the surgery.

394
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:55,362
I need a few minutes to think.

395
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:05,428
The patient asked me what I thought. I pay you to think inside this room.

396
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:09,274
Outside this room, I pay you to parrot. It's her choice. She has the right to know!

397
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,530
<i>It's a medical choice</i>

398
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:13,489
that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers.

399
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,450
You told the mom something you want to believe

400
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:18,633
because you don't want to believe that this girl might be doing fine parent-free.

401
00:26:18,634 --> 00:26:20,230
Which also happens to be what the mom wants to believe.

402
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:22,681
You think she wants to feel responsible for her daughter's illness?

403
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,591
That woman sees everything to do with her daughter through...

404
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:29,601
Guilt-colored glasses.
It's all her fault.

405
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,264
House...

406
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,294
Don't...bully her.

407
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:43,173
She's overwhelmed enough.

408
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:48,544
Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.

409
00:27:07,695 --> 00:27:09,569
You must be Dr. House.

410
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:14,525
I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something

411
00:27:14,526 --> 00:27:17,019
incredibly stupid.

412
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,454
Your daughter has a Berry aneurysm. She needs surgery.

413
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,143
What she does not need is you making this

414
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,046
or any other decision.

415
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,578
Well, I can't just leave this up to her.

416
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,784
Then leave it up to me, and just leave.

417
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:38,086
I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.

418
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,755
She hates you.

419
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:48,376
It's actually not such a big deal. There's plenty of kids who hate their parents.

420
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,486
What makes it a big deal is that she should hate you.

421
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:58,186
Playing the biology card doesn't change anything except where she lives.

422
00:27:58,186 --> 00:28:00,757
Your daughter is better off without you.

423
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:04,488
So...let her be better off without you.

424
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:14,443
I'm gonna do the surgery. I'll take the fallout from Social Services.

425
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:35,218
<i>Dr. House!</i>

426
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:46,088
My daughter's care is my choice.

427
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:51,017
And so is this. Treat her for alcoholism.

428
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:57,972
Peek-a-boo!

429
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:01,561
<i>Why would Anita</i> tell her husband about our affair?

430
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:04,189
Probably just got sick of lying. <i>Look at it this way.</i>

431
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,245
Now the sex is both commitment- and guilt-free.

432
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:11,298
And men love commitment-free sex.

433
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:14,878
Yes, they do. Oh, yes, they do!

434
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:18,337
They're gonna find out eventually.

435
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:20,655
Peek-a-boo!

436
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,406
Peek-a-boo!

437
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,059
How do you keep doing the same thing over and over

438
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,963
with the same level of enthusiasm?

439
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,017
First off, be a decent, empathetic person.

440
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:30,471
<i>This is what you</i> <i>said you wanted,</i>

441
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:31,654
but you're actually more upset

442
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:32,723
now that her husband knows.

443
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:34,517
- 'Cause I'm hurting him. - You always were.

444
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:35,743
Yeah, but he didn't know that.

445
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:37,508
Which means he wasn't really hurt.

446
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,138
Yeah, I know it's a rationalization,

447
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:41,325
<i>but it went a long way</i>

448
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:42,479
to making me feel...

449
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,163
A little less guilty about seeing her.

450
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:44,959
<i>Looks like</i> <i>you're gonna need</i>

451
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,691
a bigger rationalization.

452
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,939
Ahh...Peek-a-boo!

453
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:50,540
<i>Peek-a-boo!</i>

454
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:55,340
Social Services report came in on your mom. Ah, let me guess.

455
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,641
She passed with flying colors.

456
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,274
She always does.

457
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:04,252
I think she might make it this time.

458
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:08,727
House left a bottle of Vicodin to see if she'd steal it.

459
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,372
She gave it back.

460
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:17,059
You could at least let her sleep in the room.

461
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:19,523
She could have listened to me about my drinking.

462
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:23,642
I mean, even if you are right about it, why take your word over mine?

463
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:25,232
<i>I'm her daughter.</i>

464
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:29,825
Because it... She's your mom.

465
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:32,458
And, for the first time, she's acting like it.

466
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,861
It's a little late for that.

467
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,278
Good night.

468
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:01,330
Morning!

469
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:04,627
I heard you went head-to-head with the mom. Not for your reasons.

470
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:07,132
You're protecting the girl.
I'm protecting my diagnosis.

471
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:10,825
And you tested her--
see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.

472
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:14,200
That was to show Adams that mommie dearest hadn't changed.

473
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,749
I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.

474
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:19,234
Your patient's stable?

475
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,978
Well, maybe Adams was right. The illness is alcohol-related.

476
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:27,074
Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for.

477
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:31,086
You--you hope you're wrong for the sake of the patient?

478
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:36,905
I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her.

479
00:31:37,608 --> 00:31:39,161
Call me a softie.

480
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,462
Or the mom agrees to an autopsy so I can prove it.

481
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,130
Your patients love you because you're empathetic.

482
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:58,275
I also have kind eyes. Why are you here?

483
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:00,404
But you don't love all your patients?

484
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:05,387
Of course not. I'll--I'll bet some of them bore you.

485
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:08,627
Dull people get cancer too. Why are you here?

486
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:12,535
But you...fake an interest in them because you needed to, right?

487
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:15,240
And if you do it long enough, it becomes real?

488
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:19,882
Well, no, because the interest isn't fake.

489
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:21,206
Really?

490
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,653
Because you realize they're not dull.

491
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:27,032
It was just your misinterpretation of them.

492
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:30,605
I just haven't found a way to make them interesting yet.

493
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:34,537
It's all about common ground. You found one thing you both like or hate.

494
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:38,014
John Woo movies, romance novels, kale.

495
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:46,510
Sometimes, the best way to connect with someone is stop thinking about them and focus on yourself.

496
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:51,039
Wh--uhh. What is this about?

497
00:32:51,044 --> 00:32:54,487
Not everything has an agenda. See ya.

498
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:02,240
I told him because it was the right thing to do.

499
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:05,847
Right. This doesn't change anything between us.

500
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:08,650
It sort of does for me.

501
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,099
Y-you want to stop seeing each other? No.

502
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,539
I was thinking...

503
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:21,838
Maybe you could tell your husband that we did.

504
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:24,817
And then go back to sneaking around behind his back?

505
00:33:25,508 --> 00:33:26,797
Yes.

506
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:29,521
Why would you want to do that?

507
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:32,331
I don't know. I...

508
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,868
This just feels...

509
00:33:35,577 --> 00:33:36,805
Wrong.

510
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:43,433
I th--I think I'm gonna go.

511
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,700
Ohh, God.

512
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:05,433
We thought it was the salt pork.

513
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,966
But all the menfolk been eatin' it,

514
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,906
and we the only ones that's sick.

515
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:21,995
Which one of you is the cheap bastard?

516
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:24,990
Your uniforms.

517
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:28,733
<i>They're not wool.</i> <i>They're polyester.</i> Cheap polyester.

518
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,489
Which gets processed with a heavy metal called antimony.

519
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,393
You wear badly processed polyester all day and night for days and nights, 

520
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:38,684
you get antimony poisoning <i>which caused your diarrhea</i>

521
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:41,350
and your numbness in your hands.

522
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:43,468
And your collective vomiting.

523
00:34:45,101 --> 00:34:47,267
Polyester uniforms?

524
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:49,561
I was being authentic.

525
00:34:49,562 --> 00:34:53,450
With polyester uniforms? The Confederacy gave men $21 every six months--

526
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:55,651
- You poisoned us both. - At least I have principles.

527
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:57,346
Because they don't cost anything.

528
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:00,816
Brother against brother.
Now, that is authentic.

529
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:18,834
I know you don't want me here, <i>but, um...</i>

530
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:21,363
They had banana muffins downstairs.

531
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,951
Reminded me of our St. Pete's trip.

532
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:28,876
Remember?

533
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:33,506
<i>We used to walk</i> <i>and get some</i> every morning at that bakery.

534
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:37,795
I guess.

535
00:35:47,074 --> 00:35:49,175
Were you high on that trip?

536
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:55,695
Not when we were together.

537
00:35:57,996 --> 00:36:01,162
I used to wait until you went to bed.

538
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:12,766
You can stay. If you want.

539
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:16,901
Okay.

540
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:27,016
Mm. It's not bad.

541
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:33,048
What's happening?

542
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:36,419
Is this from the alcohol treatment? I was wrong.

543
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,778
The Berry aneurysm must have just burst.

544
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:45,383
Temporal lobes are clear. Parietal, clear.

545
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:48,479
Get me a micro-vascular clip tray as well as the occlusion.

546
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,231
Check the ventricles.

547
00:36:50,231 --> 00:36:52,162
<i>Ventricles are clear too.</i>

548
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:56,245
Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst. <i>Inject the dye.</i>

549
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:08,419
Posterior cerebral clear. Vertebral clear.

550
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,254
<i>Circle of Willis</i> <i>also clear.</i>

551
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:13,957
She doesn't have a Berry aneurysm.

552
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:25,448
Her BP's dropping. Start her on pressors.
<i>We gotta get her BP up</i> <i>before her organs</i> <i>start shutting down.</i>

553
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:27,531
Adams...with me.

554
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,990
Pressors will only give us a couple hours, Max.

555
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:33,755
What causes breathing issues, bleeding issues, paralysis,

556
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:36,793
loss of consciousness? What are we missing?

557
00:37:36,794 --> 00:37:39,190
That's everything bad that's happened. What about the good stuff?

558
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:41,474
You mean like we should be more optimistic?

559
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:44,856
She got a little better when we put her on steroids, which can attack tumor cells.

560
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:46,092
Maybe she has cancer.

561
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:49,289
No hypercalcemia, no elevated blood proteins.

562
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,592
She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida a couple years ago-- what about dengue fever?

563
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:56,076
Cholera? <i>Great ideas,</i> <i>if dengue fever</i>

564
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:58,928
or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly...

565
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:14,142
Did your biological daughter go swimming in Florida?

566
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:16,442
In a lake or a pond or an everglade?

567
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:18,307
Uh...Yeah.

568
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:21,530
There's a canal near my mother's house.

569
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:25,998
Do you know what's wrong with her? Family vacations kill.

570
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:28,253
<i>Come with me.</i>

571
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:30,353
Don't want to explain this twice.

572
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:39,132
You're letting in the flies. And she needs an LVAD. No, she doesn't.

573
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:41,823
Your daughter has ascariasis.

574
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:43,830
It's a disease caused by a parasitic worm

575
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:45,799
found in feces.

576
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,380
Animals use the canal as a potty,

577
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:52,292
the eggs from the feces ended up in Callie's intestines when she went swimming...

578
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:55,670
<i>Where they hung out,</i> quietly and asymptomatically,

579
00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:59,653
biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose.

580
00:38:59,654 --> 00:39:02,194
Maybe a dive in volleyball practice

581
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:04,560
or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen.

582
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:07,491
But once they hatched, the worms got to work on her lungs,

583
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:11,908
her ear, the nerves in her legs. The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her,

584
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:14,627
which started them on their journey to the esophagus

585
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:16,741
and, ultimately, to the heart.

586
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:21,770
A few pills of Mebendazole... She'll be fine.

587
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:33,266
She's feeling much better. Walking on her own.

588
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:36,823
Getting along with her mother?
As long as I keep bringing her muffins.

589
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:41,122
<i>Did someone come</i> take her for a test?

590
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:20,339
Callie agrees with you... That people don't change.

591
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:23,271
She said when her mom slips again, <i>she didn't want</i> <i>to be there.</i>

592
00:40:23,272 --> 00:40:25,742
<i>She'd rather remember her</i> <i>like she is now.</i>

593
00:40:27,284 --> 00:40:28,974
Smart girl.

594
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:32,220
You got the ending you wanted.

595
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,367
'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives.

596
00:40:36,777 --> 00:40:39,928
Now, I don't care if the people who work for me are screwed up.

597
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:41,786
In fact, I even encourage it.

598
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:46,238
But absolution? You do that on your own time.

599
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:53,132
Or not at all. 'Cause...Clearly, you suck at it.

600
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,127
There.

601
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,957
This is Aaron Rodgers.

602
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:35,842
Wow, 127 quarterback rating.

603
00:41:36,057 --> 00:41:37,603
You know what sound he makes?

604
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:48,185
Okay. Oy!

605
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:54,228
This... is Terrell Owens.

606
00:41:54,229 --> 00:41:58,189
People call him "T.O." Do you know what sound he makes?

607
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,156
This is Mark Sanchez. Do you know what sound people make about him?

608
00:42:18,595 --> 00:42:19,864
Working late?

609
00:42:21,528 --> 00:42:23,249
Husband have her tonight?

610
00:42:24,928 --> 00:42:26,374
And every night.

611
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:31,280
She broke it off. It's for the best.

612
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:34,181
I'm not really an affair guy after all.

613
00:42:34,296 --> 00:42:36,386
Sure you are, buddy.

614
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:41,305
You just lost interest once it stopped being an affair. That's why you're relieved.

615
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:43,923
But don't worry-- it's not gonna end here.

616
00:42:43,923 --> 00:42:46,871
You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else.

617
00:42:46,871 --> 00:42:51,308
When that doesn't do it anymore, then you'll just...？？？

618
00:42:52,578 --> 00:42:55,430
At least, that's what I've been told.

619
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:59,253
I'm not like you, House.
