1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,360
<i>If you don't know</i> <i>how to use a computer,</i> <i>we will teach you here.</i></i>

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,330
Most jobs require at least basic word processing skills.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,590
We try to get you up to 50 words per minute.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,800
We also have a course in how to talk to someone <i>in an interview.</i></i>

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,540
<i>Stuff like</i> what employers are looking for,</i>

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,380
how to turn negatives into positives.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,510
We can also provide clothes for the interview if you need them.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,740
People donate shoes and suits all the time.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,950
Wh-what if I had a history with, uh...

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,700
With drugs? That is nothing to be ashamed of.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,710
Many of our clients have struggled with addiction,

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,970
and, if you want to get clean, we'll help you do that.

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,370
And what if I have a kid?

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,580
No one to help you?

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,400
You know, if I need someone to watch her while I'm in class or, uh, on an interview.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,380
Could you help with that? We do not provide child care.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,690
Actually, it's something that comes up often.

18
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,450
I would love to be able to do it. I just don't have the resources.

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,360
But it's definitely on the wish list.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:57,950
Okay.

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,450
Okay, uh, thank you.

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,160
I'll be back. Oh, I have to take this.

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,460
Yes, please come back, and we'll get you started.

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,900
It was nice to meet you, Benjamin. Okay.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,900
Hey, Oscar.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,540
Agh! Oh, that is too bad.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,330
Did they tell you why?

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,130
Yeah.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,740
Well, you know what?
Sometimes, you just don't get the job, but...

30
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,880
Oscar, I gotta call you back.

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,710
REMITTER BENJAMIN BYRD FOUNDATION/PAY TO THE PHOENIC FOUNDATION / ONE MILLION DOALLRS

32
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,760
Benjamin!
Benjamin, wait!

33
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,860
Oh, my God. Uh...

34
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,380
Somebody call an ambulance!

35

Why am I watching you cut your hair?

47
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,330
If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,780
Does a friend watch you where it's happening, and wonder why?

49
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,910
New life, new look.

50
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,160
Does that mean you like your new life?

51
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,860
If you're asking if your job is safe,

52
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,640
that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.

53
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,680
It doesn't seem like much of a case.

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
Although, I'm sure I'm wrong.

55
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,100
You are. Tell my why.

56
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,100
Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours on a hot day without breakfast...

57
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,260
So that's really weird.
E.R. found nothing wrong.

58
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,050
Then I decided I should test his wallet.

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,340
He's rich? That's why we're taking the case?

60
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,920
No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him.

61
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,050
<i>And</i> he's rich.</i>

62
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,750
Dr. Adams.

63
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,850
Give her the file.

64
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,770
This is my only copy.

65
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,170
My M.O. depends upon the use of a team.

66
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,230
Definitionally, that involves... more than one person.

67
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,620
So I really have no choice. Give her the file.

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,540
You can't afford a team.
Adams is free.

69
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,830
And I'm referring both to her availability
and her price tag.

70
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,060
New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa.

71
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,150
You said we were meeting for coffee.

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,630
Well, when someone asks if you want coffee,

73
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,500
they obviously don't just mean coffee.

74
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,770
Wait...did you think I was referring to sex?

75
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,610
Would you shut the blinds on your way out?

76
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,980
I thought you were referring to talking. Talking about medicine.

77
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,280
Specifically, as it refers to the guy

78
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,660
whose name is on the file she <i>still</i> hasn't handed you.</i>

79
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,490
I'm not working, House.
I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.

80
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,700
In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering

81
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,280
all over town--
ladling kittens, spaying soup...

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,620
There is a free clinic in Trenton.

83
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,300
Well, think of this as today's free clinic.

84
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,170
Only with fewer bums with herpes.

85
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,750
I don't think we actually have much of a case. <i>I think it's just</i></i>

86
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,870
dehydration.

87
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,020
What happened the last time
another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?

88
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,580
I lost my job. You saved a life.

89
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,370
Is an ultrasound really necessary? I'm feeling much better now.

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,490
Oh, a sudden collapse at your age can indicate a deterioration of the heart muscle.

91
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,180
Pretty serious condition.

92
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,550
It can also just be dehydration.

93
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,630
Next time, you could probably drop the undercover act.

94
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,910
I walk in in a suit,

95
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,020
and they're gonna put their best foot forward.

96
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,860
Also, I don't own a suit.

97
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,500
You give away millions and you don't own a suit?

98
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,780
I gave those away too.

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,780
One day, I was writing a check to my landscaper, and it suddenly hit me--

100
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,180
$6,000 to take out plants and put in different plants.

101
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,880
So I can look at them.

102
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,140
Shouldn't I use that money to do something important?

103
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,800
<i>And by money,</i> you mean all your money.</i>

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,020
I started with 10 million,

105
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,900
and I couldn't think of a reason not to give 20.

106
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,320
Or 40.

107
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,660
I figure I could live off $25,000 a year.

108
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,910
One-room apartment. Bus pass, thrift stores.

109
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,130
Bare necessities.

110
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,210
I still have my software company.

111
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,930
And when I make more, I'll give that way too.

112
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,640
- He's nuts. - He's generous.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,310
There's a neurological issue.
He's getting rid of everything.

114
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,050
His echocardiogram is negative
for cardiomyopathy.

115
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,860
Head CT showed no signs of stroke or hemorrhage.
He has one pair of pants.

116
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,780
Most people with his kind of money are commissioning oil paintings of their Yorkshire terrier.

117
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,210
<i>Benjamin is sacrificing</i> his own comfort to help others.</i>

118
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,430
That's because helping others <i>is</i> his Yorkie oil painting.</i>

119
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,780
That's good.
Not sick.

120
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,740
That's naive <i>and</i> sick.
You really want to improve things?</i>

121
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,900
You do it through policy.

122
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,700
This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?

123
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,000
That's right, all those babies with aids, they're just using us.

124
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,990
My parents had $800 between them when they got here.

125
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,560
<i>They scraped and borrowed</i> <i>so we could</i> <i>go to good schools,</i></i>

126
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,100
and I worked my ass off.

127
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,120
No one gave me a handout.
It makes me work harder.

128
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,190
Rebuttal.

129
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,820
What's your evil plan?
I object to your cynicism.

130
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,000
- It's been earned. - <i>That's what I object to.</i></i>

131
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,960
The new Dean of Medicine has an ethical obligation

132
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,820
to come in with a completely open mind
<i>about all employees,</i></i>

133
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,120
thus letting me blithely run roughshod
for at least four weeks.

134
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,540
My theory is that you're running a battery of tests

135
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,630
<i>to convince him</i> <i>that you saved his life,</i>
then con him into funding you to hire back your team.</i>

136
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,070
- What? - Your old team?

137
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,850
What?
<i>This is your new reality.</i></i>

138
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,180
You've got your office. You've got neighbors.

139
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,030
You've got one employee, one volunteer.

140
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,780
<i>Until she finds</i> <i>actual, paid work,</i>
<i>or gets sick of you.</i></i>

141
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,930
I talked to Chase and Taub. They're willing to come back.

142
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,250
What about Thirteen? Not a good choice.

143
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,120
She's not long term because she has no long term.

144
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,940
Not taking your calls?

145
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,430
She will.

146
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,210
Discharge the patient.

147
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,650
Unexplained loss of consciousness
could be cardiomyopathy,

148
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,990
global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage--

149
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,750
dehydration.
<i>He was given fluids,</i> <i>and he got better.</i></i>

150
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,620
<i>And I'm sure your tests</i> <i>have come up negative,</i>
or you would have shut me up already.</i>

151
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,330
Which means he goes home.

152
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,580
<i>There is a symptom...</i></i>

153
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,130
Extreme altruism.

154
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,180
You've got two choices, House.

155
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,160
You can recognize that your patient is just a very nice, healthy guy,

156
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,390
and send him home,
or you can consider altruism a symptom.

157
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,000
In which case, you cannot take his money.

158
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,500
Send him home.
And check with admitting

159
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,520
for the net worth of all new patients.

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,400
<i>I'm not coming back,</i> <i>House.</i></i>

161
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,600
Technically, you're back right now.

162
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,820
I need you to stop calling me.
First 17 messages were cute, but--

163
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,010
I'm putting the band back together.

164
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,790
Interesting that you never showed up at my place,
what with your love of annoying me

165
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,890
and your inability to take no for an answer.

166
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,430
I'm guessing ankle monitor.

167
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,290
Guilty as charged.

168
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,620
Literally.

169
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,320
I'm not a doctor anymore, House.

170
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,580
The job went away, but not the profession.

171
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,590
You look healthy, so... That's not it.

172
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,520
You met a boy. Or a girl.

173
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,040
Fall in love, wanna be happy.

174
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,120
You decided to... Enjoy what time you have left.

175
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,750
You're going to Thailand.

176
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,760
Girl.

177
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,610
And Mykonos.

178
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
Turns out I like boring.

179
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,180
No, you wanna like boring.

180
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,790
But if you actually liked boring,
you would have figured that out in fifth grade,

181
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,200
when you were bored. Please stop calling me.

182
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,210
No.

183
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,360
<i>You showed up</i> to tell me that you don't want to hear from me.</i>

184
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,600
That's a mixed signal.

185
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,060
I will choose to listen to your actions
rather than your words.

186
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,840
They're more honest.

187
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,790
I'm a little confused.

188
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,410
The test is designed to determine if you're--

189
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,950
No, I mean your running a test and discharging me.

190
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,660
Was I dehydrated or not? I think so.

191
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,780
But, out of an abundance of caution,

192
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,710
my colleague has taken it upon herself to do one more test.

193
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,750
All right.

194
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,740
You scare me a little.

195
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,000
Why?

196
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,530
I've been considering
applying to Doctors Without Borders.

197
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,060
Going overseas a while,
and that seems like a huge sacrifice.

198
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,620
But...You--
<i>you don't scare her.</i></i>

199
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,100
You make her feel guilty.

200
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,850
Oh, you...

201
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,680
You like your life that way it is.
<i>Most people give the minimum</i> <i>they have to give</i></i>

202
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,550
<i>so they can enjoy</i> <i>what they have left.</i>
<i>I guess my minimum</i> <i>is just...</i></i>

203
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,260
Higher than most.
<i>Complete recruitment</i> <i>and interference pattern.</i></i>

204
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,620
His leg muscles are fine.

205
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,810
I feel, uh, funny.

206
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,980
Where? My chest.

207
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,670
You're tachycardic. Your heart's beating too fast.

208
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,510
Unbelievable.

209
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,710
Patient got tachycardic to 185.

210
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,040
We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine.

211
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,820
There's definitely something wrong with him. Which is awesome.

212
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,970
Now there's something to cure,

213
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,340
which means there's something to be
disproportionately financially grateful for.

214
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,700
Morning. Got you a coffee.

215
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,040
Thanks.

216
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,180
Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse

217
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,400
that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.

218
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,680
Oh, that's fine. Keep it.

219
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,910
<i>We looked at his heart</i> <i>yesterday,</i> <i>didn't see any</i> <i>structural abnormalities.</i></i>

220
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,990
I'm thinking occult long QT syndrome?

221
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,500
What about Whipple's? If it was Whipple's, there'd be some kind of neurological involvement.

222
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,140
You don't think defying human nature is neurological?

223
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,920
Racing heart: Medical condition. Bleeding heart: Stupid condition.

224
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,210
Are you saying that because you believe it,
<i>or because it's in your</i> <i>financial best interest</i></i>

225
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,890
to think his generosity isn't just temporary?

226
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm told that some people are just nice.

227
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,230
I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.

228
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,000
Benjamin's been taking allergy medication the last few weeks.

229
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,610
Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.

230
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,010
Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines,

231
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,220
then do an EKG.

232
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,320
No, wait. I'll do the flushing.

233
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,940
Take the damn $2.00.
She hasn't even sipped the coffee.

234
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,190
I just got so angry. You know?

235
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,130
So I made a terrible mistake.

236
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,600
Now I'm trying to start my life over.

237
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,970
To help people the way I always wanted.

238
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,190
But my department got defunded, and...

239
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,350
it's my fault.

240
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,040
Just can't stand to think of all those patients

241
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,400
going untreated because I don't have the resources to do my best work.

242
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,410
How about I help you out?
How do you mean?

243
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,520
I'll give $1 million as an endowment to the hospital,

244
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,130
earmarked for diagnostics.

245
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,930
I am an opportunistic ex-con

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,910
who just gave you a two-minute sob story

247
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,060
as step three in my master plan,

248
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,440
and you've offered me $1 million.

249
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,770
Which is step 17.

250
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,910
Is that bad?

251
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,750
Ethics are not my strong suit.

252
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,710
<i>Hypothetical--</i>
if I'm offered oral sex</i>

253
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,870
from a sexaholic, do I have to decline?

254
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,700
<i>Don't answer yet.</i></i>

255
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,360
Saying no will cause both of us pain.

256
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,240
Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.

257
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,780
You can't take sex from a sexaholic.

258
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,420
You can't give booze to an alcoholic,
and you can't take this guy's money.

259
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,520
Could be wrong about the symptom.
I'm wrong all the time.

260
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,440
<i>Taking money</i> <i>from a sick person</i>
is ethically suspect at best.</i>

261
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,580
<i>What is this, Canada?</i></i>

262
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,760
All we do is take money from sick people.
We work for it.

263
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm working!
How much?

264
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,780
$20.
<i>Well, what if it was?</i></i>

265
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,530
<i>It's the same principle.</i>
$20, $1 million... What's the difference?</i>

266
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,500
Actually, the difference is pretty much $1 million.

267
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,470
He came up with the figure, not me.

268
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,620
Crap.

269
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,360
Got a patient with end stage renal disease.

270
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,220
<i>Her heart can't</i> <i>support dialysis.</i></i>

271
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,660
She needs a transplant, but...

272
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,650
you tuned out as soon as it stopped being about you,
didn't you?

273
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,510
- What? - I gotta go.

274
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,810
It's all moot.

275
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,060
Patient probably has long QT.

276
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,480
Probably just a really, really decent person.

277
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,330
They exist, right?
You can't take the money, House.

278
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,560
<i>Is long QT bad?</i></i>

279
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,770
It's a tough thing to control.

280
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,360
Is there someone you want me to call?

281
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,630
There's someone I would like to call.

282
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,810
She's the same person who won't take my calls.

283
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,600
My wife.

284
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,730
When I started giving away the money, I--

285
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,910
I hoped she'd want to do it with me. She didn't.

286
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,840
I miss them.

287
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,750
I have two little boys.

288
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,580
Having a family doesn't exempt me from social responsibility.

289
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,310
But family comes first.

290
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,550
It should.

291
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,610
I know that sounds weird, but...
someone who's related to you,

292
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,750
does that empirically make them more special?
More deserving than anyone else?

293
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,400
Yes, it gives you a responsibility.

294
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,640
My boys have a roof over their heads.

295
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,350
They're not starving.

296
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,790
I pay court-ordered child support,

297
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,800
and, frankly, it's, uh... more than they need.

298
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,820
I love them more than anything, I just...

299
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,550
I can't justify buying video games and private schools

300
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,250
when other people's children are starving.

301
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,840
I hope, one day, they'll understand that.

302
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,680
Your hands are trembling.
Is it the electrodes?

303
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,610
Are you in pain?
No.

304
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,860
What's happening?
I'm not sure, but it's not what we thought it was.

305
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,000
So...

306
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,390
arrhythmia, fainting, muscle tremors.
Plus, unfortunately, mental changes.

307
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,330
I still don't think it's neurological.

308
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,140
God bless you.

309
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,300
He lost his wife and kids because she couldn't stop giving money away.

310
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,650
He lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.

311
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,820
She's not drinking the coffee either. Drink it, don't drink it.

312
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,830
The point is, I gave it to you, so we're even.

313
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,160
Even?
It was a gift.

314
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,900
An insignificant token.
There was nothing owed.

315
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,340
That was the whole point.
Why?

316
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,510
Why?
Yeah, why?

317
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,130
She's the crazy one.

318
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,390
So a guy gives everything Sane.

319
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,660
Girl who doesn't want anything from a stranger is crazy.

320
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,280
You're not a stranger.

321
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,480
And your perverse view of the world
is making you force a neurological component

322
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,650
onto an obviously cardiological--
Your parents didn't love you enough.

323
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,100
So you need to prove your superiority.

324
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,400
Or they love you too much, so you need to prove your humility.

325
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,380
Or it's just rich guilt.

326
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm betting on the last one.

327
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,490
There's a whole list of drugs
that could have caused his symptoms.

328
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,030
I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs

329
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,130
when there are orphans out there without cable.

330
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,810
Anyway, he'd be getting better right now,
not worse.

331
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,590
Could be polyarteritis nodosa.
That comes with a rash.

332
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,750
Echovirus.

333
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,530
Virus, virus, virus, virus... Fits his physical symptoms.

334
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,880
And could,

335
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,430
but doesn't necessarily cause personality changes.

336
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,750
Works for everyone?

337
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,240
Start him on antivirals.

338
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,080
And, Adams... when you treat,

339
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,600
and he gets better,

340
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,580
and doesn't give Bob Cratchit Christmas day off, you owe me a coffee.

341
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,080
<i>Click the third tab</i> <i>from the left</i></i>

342
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,530
<i>and find the box that says</i> <i>"previous entries."</i></i>

343
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,370

344
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,120
Thank you.
<i>Appreciate your help.</i></i>

345
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,260
You're gonna read too much into this, aren't you?
No, not at all.

346
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,570
We're gonna fundamentally disagree
about what it means to read too much into this.

347
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,950
<i>Aren't we?</i>
Yes, absolutely.</i>

348
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,100
Look, I thought about what you said,
and I realized you were right.

349
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,930
Great. See you tomorrow morning.

350
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,580
No, you won't.
Afternoon?

351
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,580
<i>I can't think of</i> <i>another interpretation.</i></i>

352
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,140
Shut up.

353
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,070
<i>Look, I'm not sure</i>
what you were trying to achieve.</i>

354
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,210
I'm never quite sure.

355
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,880
But you were actually a friend to me
when I needed it.

356
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,530
<i>I don't wanna come back</i> <i>to work for you.</i></i>

357
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,820
But I was wrong to try to push you out of my life.

358
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,340
Everything has gone blue.

359
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,220
<i>That's not supposed</i> <i>to happen, right?</i></i>

360
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,800
Stay there. I'm comin'. No...You don't have to do that.

361
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,620
Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace

362
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,030
and get some lo mein and a szechuan beef.

363
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,290
That is six miles out of my way.
<i>Oh, okay, then.</i></i>

364
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,240
Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria,

365
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,760
which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere.

366
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,800
Fine.
I'll get the food.

367
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,790
<i>You're a peach.</i></i>

368
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,950
I started the last round of pleconaril.

369
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,120
Can you do me a favor?

370
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,060
A favor?

371
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,520
You want me to return these?
Give them to someone?

372
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,040
Wear them while you masturbate?

373
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,430
I...want you to have them.

374
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,680
That's not a favor.

375
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,670
It was a two-for-one sale. I couldn't resist.
I need to justify buying them.

376
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,050
They're $120.

377
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,250
My car is in the shop.
I'm short on cash this month.

378
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,290
I can't pay you back.

379
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,100
The first pair were $120.

380
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,970
These...were free.

381
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,700
You do know I punched
the last person that pissed me off?

382
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,660
Was it Santa?

383
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,540
What's your patient's status?

384
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,000
Better.
We're discharging him.

385
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,610
Good.

386
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,650
Why do you care?

387
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,930
Specifically.

388
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,120
Although I'm curious about a general answer too.

389
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,160
Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my patient with renal failure.

390
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,320
Did he meet your patient with renal failure?

391
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,690
No, he heard the nurses talking about her,
that she was short on time.

392
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,540
I was wrong.
Don't say that.

393
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,910
House, she really needs this kidney.

394
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,220
He's not better.
His mental status is declining.

395
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,920
Or he's doing an amazing thing
for another human being.

396
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,780
I thought it was an ethical no-brainer
that we can't take stuff from sick people.

397
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,220
I changed my mind.

398
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,620
He's still sick. His symptoms have gone away.

399
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,490
Not all of them.

400
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,680
Offering an organ to a stranger
<i>is</i> a symptom.</i>

401
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,780
A couple dozen people a year
make undirected kidney donations.

402
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,870
Yeah, how many of them are also in the process
of pauperizing themselves?

403
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,200
If the guy threw himself on a grenade, he'd be a hero.

404
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,220
If it saves a life, who cares? You do!

405
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,240
Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument.

406
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,050
If there's even a chance I'm right,

407
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,160
it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.

408
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,160
More dangerous than complete renal failure?
My patient needs this.

409
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,020
Now.
Why do you wanna give away your kidney?

410
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,790
There are 70,000 people in this country

411
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,080
on the active waiting list for a kidney,
and less than 10,000 dead people a year

412
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,360
to give them one.
Yeah.

413
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,440
If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year,
all would be golden.

414
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,780
I'll give you your money.

415
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,560
See? Crazy.

416
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,360
Being a live donor has risks.
I looked it up.

417
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,020
The risk is 1 in 4,000 I could die during surgery,

418
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,020
which means, if I don't donate,

419
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,670
I'm valuing my life at 4,000 times someone else's.

420
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,770
<i>It's not like</i> <i>I want to be</i>
cut open and have a part of me taken out.</i>

421
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,300
But I've got two, and this woman has none.

422
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,650
She'll die without it.
Perfectly logical.

423
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,860
People with mental deficiency can be logical.

424
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,960
that he's sick.

425
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,060
...

426
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,880
??????????

427
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,740
I'm gonna let him be a donor.

428
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,090
<i>Dr. House,</i>
it's not a symptom.</i>

429
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,630
Come back after you're convinced that I'm healthy,
and I will give you your money.

430
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,660
No, you won't.

431
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,180
We have time for one more test
before we move him.

432
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,500
What test? Whatever test will prove

433
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,740
there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously.

434
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,850
I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's.

435
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,700
Causes arrhythmia, tremor,
and mental changes.

436
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,050
Bad idea.
There's no joint pain.

437
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,870
Where's Adams? We thought the case was over.

438
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,100
She has a job interview.

439
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,580
Why is she here?

440
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,670
<i>'Cause I called her.</i></i>

441
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,740
Bigger question is why that worked.
I'm here because I have time

442
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,700
and you have a crisis and I--
we're too busy for rationalizations.

443
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,300
Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life.

444
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,620
He's probably not eating all that healthy.
Magnesium deficiency?

445
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,850
<i>Wait until they take him</i> <i>back to his room--draw blood,</i></i>

446
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,060
do an expanded electrolyte profile.

447
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,660
<i>No, he hasn't had</i>
anxiety or any trouble sleeping.</i>

448
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,520
I think it's Whipple's disease.
Bad idea. He doesn't have joint pain.

449
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,320
<i>Joint pain is common,</i> <i>but not definitive.</i></i>

450
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,450
<i>Whipple's explains</i> <i>all of his symptoms,</i></i>

451
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,130
<i>including</i> <i>the personality change.</i></i>

452
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,280
And it would respond to antibiotics,
which is why he started to feel better.

453
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,680
Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.
You were right.

454
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,190
Counts for nothing if you can't defend it.

455
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,450
Book a procedure room.

456
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,500
Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.

457
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,620
Guilt.

458
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,420
You feel guilty about leaving.

459
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,760
<i>Yes, I think</i> <i>that little of you</i>
and that much of me.</i>

460
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,880
You're nothing without me.
<i>Not leaving me.</i></i>

461
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,190
Leaving humanity.

462
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,490
I'm going with my girlfriend.

463
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,080
The woman I love. To have fun.

464
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,360
You're trying to make me feel guilty because you're saving lives here.

465
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,710
And I think that's great. I'm proud to have been a part of it,

466
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,160
but...now...

467
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
I just wanna be happy.

468
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,560
Oh...no one's unhappy in Greece.

469
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,670
<i>It just appeared</i> <i>in the last few weeks.</i></i>

470
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,030
<i>He's having trouble</i> <i>holding a pencil in school.</i>
Does it itch?</i>

471
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,990
Do anything different lately?

472
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,950
You get a new baseball glove, a new kitten?

473
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,530
Well, the neighbors put in a pool, so he's been spending a lot of time over there.

474
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,350
But, well, if it was something in the water,
it would be everywhere, wouldn't it?

475
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,530
It is in the water.
He's allergic to chlorine?

476
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,780
No...

477
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,880
He's allergic to summer lilac.

478
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,850
That's my lotion. And it's not in the pool.

479
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,850
No, it's on the palms of his hands.

480
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,880
In the pool is the neighbor's daughter.

481
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,440
Or the neighbor's hot wife.

482
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,290
Here's some lube.

483
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,120
Sorry. Too late for your eyesight.

484
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,120
Endoscopy didn't reveal any lesions

485
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,450
in the small intestine.

486
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,510
I'm running PCR test now.

487
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,210
Found it in my office.

488
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,730
Appears to be a gift. That can't be good.

489
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,640
Damn it. You got her the job interview.

490
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,480
And that was supposed to be the end of it. I...don't take charity.

491
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,600
Good for you! You loon.

492
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,930
I don't like owing people things.

493
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,040
So either you're so insecure

494
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,920
that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand,
or you're so arrogant

495
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,510
that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.
Or it's your family,

496
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,600
some kind of immigrant pride thing.

497
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,800
I'm betting on the last one.

498
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,440
I just don't like it.

499
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,520
It makes me feel...Icky.

500
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,310
That's the reason? Ickiness?

501
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,070
You never even tried to analyze this?

502
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,580
It's even crazier than the gift thing.

503
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,300
House...

504
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,210
there's no sign of tropheryma DNA.

505
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,560
It's not Whipple's.

506
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,320
Well...we did what we could.

507
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,840
You sure you wanna do this?

508
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,030
Relax.

509
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,220
This is gonna make me very happy.

510
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,000
Dr. Simpson.
<i>Heart rate's 140,</i> <i>pressure's dropping.</i></i>

511
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,230
Get him adenosine, stat.

512
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,010
<i>Patient's unstable.</i> <i>Surgery's off.</i></i>

513
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,160
Arrhythmia's back. He's on Heparin and stable for now,

514
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,440
but this could put him at risk for stroke or embolism.

515
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,940
Maybe he got bit by a spider.

516
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,960
The symptoms can take up to three days to manifest.
He'd have localized pain.

517
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,830
LCDD?

518
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,340
Almost always hits the kidneys.

519
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,270
Ah, Dr. Foreman.
Perhaps you can help us.

520
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,740
<i>I can't decide whether to</i> <i>take out an "I told you so" ad</i></i>

521
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,150
<i>in</i> the New England Journal <i>or stay classy</i></i>

522
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,430
and just spray-paint it on your car.
You're off the case.

523
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,360
That seems like an overreaction.

524
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,360
You dosed him.
<i>Couldn't stand</i> <i>to lose him as a patient,</i></i>

525
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,200
<i>so you faked his symptom</i> <i>to prove you right.</i>
That's idiotic.</i>

526
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,570
Sorry.
<i>Don't apologize.</i></i>

527
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,280
I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid,

528
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,390
but I know she's right.

529
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,370
Two lives are in the balance here.

530
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,970
House, I worked for you for seven years.
I know how you operate.

531
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,850
So when I see symptoms magically show up
right when you need them--

532
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,640
<i>And I was your boss</i> <i>for seven years.</i></i>

533
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,690
And I know what a suspicious, micromanaging hard-ass you are.

534
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,400
<i>Why would I do this now?</i></i>

535
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,770
Knowing you can send me right back to jail?

536
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,180
What'd you give him? Nothing!

537
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,590
You can't prove otherwise.

538
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,010
So why don't you do the smart thing here?

539
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,770
You're off the case.

540
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,320
You no longer have access to this patient.

541
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,370
You can't let him do this.
He's the boss.

542
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,490
And he's right.

543
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,050
I assume you dosed the patient because you're really certain

544
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,840
he has a neurological condition?

545
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,350
I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light

546
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,100
'cause you didn't get the job?

547
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,490
What's with you and Park?

548
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,460
Nothing.

549
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,620
I expect my people to lie better than that.

550
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,660
Either you're getting her gifts because

551
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,020
you want her to like you, in which case I don't like you,

552
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,620
or you're getting her gifts to screw with her.

553
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,640
In which case, I will be teaching you my secret homey handshake.

554
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,020
I just...I thought it was interesting

555
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,620
she couldn't accept that coffee.

556
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,400
I wanted to see how deep it went.

557
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,790
But now?
Oh, now I just want to win.

558
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,400
What was in the box?
Gift certificate.

559
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,840
The spa.

560
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,300
Nah, that's not gonna do it.

561
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,650
You're up against a lifetime of training.

562
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,620
If you wanna win, you gotta do something
she can't possibly reciprocate.

563
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,910
You gotta push her neuroses to the point
where even she thinks that she's crazy.

564
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,480
One more favor.

565
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,010
Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forever.

566
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,940
Or I'm lying.

567
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,240
Either way, it's more interesting than whatever you're doing now.

568
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,460
Can I help you? I'm his wife.

569
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,760
We're separated.
I heard he was sick.

570
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,460
I just... Wanted to see him.

571
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,430
He's giving a kidney to someone he's never met?

572
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,260
He wants to, yeah.

573
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,120
I know he's talked about you.
He's been alone all this time.

574
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,270
I'm sure it would mean a lot to him
to see you.

575
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,020
I wanted to spend my life with him, but...

576
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,700
I need to feel like he loves me more than other people.

577
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,060
Like he loves our kids more.

578
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,470
Maybe that's selfish.

579
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,700
I should go.

580
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,050
Was that my wife?

581
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,870
I don't know.

582
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,740
You the guy, the kidney donor?

583
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,860
There was a problem, but...

584
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,290
I'm gonna try again.

585
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,500
Um...to give it to the same lady?

586
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,700
She needs it.

587
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,700
Okay. Never mind.

588
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,880
Wait.

589
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,340
What do you-- what do you want?

590
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,300
Uh, it's nothing. It's just...

591
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,700
I have polycystic kidney disease.

592
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,480
And I need a transplant, and they say I don't have much time,

593
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,300
so when I heard that you were willing, I just...

594
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,300
But I'm glad it's going to someone.

595
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,670
I'll give it to you.

596
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,980
But you already promised it to someone else.
I have another one.

597
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:42,510
Saving one life is good.
Saving two is better.

598
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,560
You give away two kidneys, and you die.

599
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,270
I could live on dialyses for years.

600
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,900
Yes, and-- and then you die.
And then I could donate my other organs.

601
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,950
Heart, lungs.

602
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,730
I could save four or five more lives.

603
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,740
Foreman's gonna need a diagnostician.

604
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,980
This guy is crazy.

605
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,360
<i>Arrhythmia,</i> <i>muscle tremors,</i>
and, yes, mental changes.</i>

606
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,360
If his heart doesn't rupture,
he's liable to rip it out and give it away.

607
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,220
You know, the "down" vibe in here

608
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,710
is totally ruining my <i>Charlie's Angels</i> fantasy.</i>

609
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,940
And that haircut isn't helping, either.

610
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,800
<i>It seems like</i> <i>Graves disease</i></i>

611
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,010
or some other thyroid issue.
Is she on the team now?

612
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,230
Like, forever?

613
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,480
His thyroid levels were within normal range when he was admitted.

614
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,960
Could be Coxsackie B virus.
Or pericarditis.

615
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,370
What about porphyria?
It's a little weird without the rash,

616
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,880
<i>but it fits all</i> <i>of his other symptoms.</i></i>

617
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,190
And if it is acute intermittent porphyria,

618
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,400
that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.

619
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,900
It's unlikely... but it's possible.
What else?

620
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,330
I said what else?

621
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,990
Oh, for...

622
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,910
There. That's better.
Now, what else?

623
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,400
Well, if there's nothing better than possible,

624
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,760
then possible gets upgraded to probable.

625
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,730
I'll start him on hematin.
No, I'll go.

626
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,440
So what's the answer?
Are you now on the team?

627
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,380
Like, forever?

628
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,200
I don't know.

629
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,540
'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.

630
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,740
I don't know...House.
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

631
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,120
I trained to be a Doctor.

632
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,520
I know how to take someone's pain away,

633
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,520
how to make a stopped heart beat again.

634
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,280
We've brought people's kids back.

635
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,760
Their husbands...

636
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,720
So...guilt?

637
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,320
Yes, you were right.
You're always right.

638
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,090
I just...

639
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,950
I have the skills to help people.

640
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,680
Is it okay for me to walk away from that

641
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,310
because I...want to just have fun?

642
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,020
Obviously not.

643
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,490
How's your patient?

644
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,800
She died a few hours ago.

645
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,690
Thirteen is back.

646
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,590
No department. No money.

647
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,860
And somehow, you managed to con her
into hanging around.

648
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,550
I have a gift.

649
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,390
What?
It was a con.

650
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,850
The patient was faking?

651
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,450
No, I was.

652
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,700
I brought him in here under false pretenses.

653
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,350
Just to get his money.

654
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,490
I ordered a bunch of random tests to keep him here.

655
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,500
One of them was a head CT, which uses...

656
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,540
Iodine contrast. You think he's allergic to Iodine?

657
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,330
No, again.
Just don't interrupt me.

658
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,100
Thirteen was right.

659
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,270
This is a thyroid issue.

660
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,050
He has Plummer's disease.

661
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,110
He has a nodule in his thyroid.

662
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,060
It produces excess hormone.

663
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,900
Not enough to test abnormal,

664
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,890
just more than his brain is used to.

665
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,790
Just enough to make him irrationally generous,
make him vulnerable to overheating.

666
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,750
Then you pumped his body full of Iodine and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.

667
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,610
I said don't interrupt. But, yes, you're right.

668
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,900
Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.

669
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,290
Two days, one surgery.

670
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,520
I now accept, that your all better.

671
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,330
Where's my money?
You made me sick.

672
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,900
You were already sick.

673
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,980
I just made you much, much worse.

674
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,240
Seriously...the money.

675
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,460
You're not giving it to me, are you?

676
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,430
When you're facing death...

677
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,890
some things come into focus.

678
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,210
<i>My wife.</i>
You love your family. You want them back.</i>

679
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,740
Your altruism was always a symptom.

680
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,930
No, it wasn't. I'm still gonna--

681
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,220
Keep less? How much less?

682
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,060
Just enough to spoil your kids?
No.

683
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,990
But they need it more than people with TB

684
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,560
or children in Indonesia with no eyes?

685
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,820
Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?

686
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,560
I don't wanna give you money because you're an ass.

687
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,240
I was an ass last week.

688
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,060
I love my family.

689
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,580
I want to be with them.

690
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,330
That doesn't make me a bad person.

691
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,650
No.

692
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,230
It makes you a healthy person.

693
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,650
My mechanic called.
He said the work's been paid for.

694
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,540
You mentioned your car was in the shop.

695
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,420
That's $4,500.

696
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,580
Smile and say thank you.

697
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,550
Or I get you G.P.S.

698
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,040
You win.

699
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:30,840
Thank you.

700
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,920
Your car is getting fixed.

701
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,640
You're right. She went for it.

702
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,150
Good work.

703
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,160
Need a lift tomorrow?

704
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,430
'Cause your car is still in the shop.

705
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,800
I don't take charity. I'm just glad it's over.

706
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,740
Nothing is ever over.

707
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,620
* To live, oh *

708
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,440
* and I've been trying hard against *

709
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,820
* unbelievable odds *

710
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,880
* gets so hard in times like now *

711
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,280
* to hold on *

712
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,470
* but guns they wait to be stuck by *

713
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,250
<i>Thirteen.</i></i>

714
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:25,940
Wait a minute.

715
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:34,040
* there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round *

716
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,460
You're fired.

717
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,020
Now what? House, I'm starving.

718
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,870
I'm not joking. You're fired.
<i>Don't come in tomorrow.</i></i>

719
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,750
House...

720
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,890
I can work with people who've got nowhere else to go.

721
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,580
People who got something to prove.
People who just get off on weird cases.

722
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,790
What I can't work with is someone who's here

723
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,440
so she doesn't have to feel bad.

724
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,850
* Places where they send you *

725
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,540
You're trying to save me.

726
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,680
Yes...I think that little of you and that much of me.

727
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,360
* They'll zip you up and dress you down *

728
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,020
* and stand you in a row *

729
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,400
* but you know you don't have to *

730
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,000
* you can just say no *

731
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,790
Okay.

732
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,550
* and there ain't no one *

733
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,200
Bye, House.

734
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,240
* Goin' to turn me around *

735
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,580
* there ain't no one *

736
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:33,090
* goin' to turn me around *

737
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,240
