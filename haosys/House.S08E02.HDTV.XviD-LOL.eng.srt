1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,880
get up, house. must be some mistake.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,260
i specifically requested my wakeup startle three hours from now.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,270
some vip visitor.
dean of medicine from your old hospital.

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,650
i've had dreams about this.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,090
i'm going to assume this is another one.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,360
get up.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,080
i can refuse to see any visitor i want.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,070
tell the dean that i don't want to see her.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,680
he said you'd say that.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,920
he?

11
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,360
what's the hiring policy over there?

12
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,050
all ass based?

13
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,330
i can get you out of here.

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,340
not unless that file has a file in it.

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,120
judge's order for your immediate release.

16
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,360
i had eight months added to my sentence two months ago.

17
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,930
the math is pretty basic. we have a crisis.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,080
which is good news for you.

19
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,000
you're out tonight on conditional parole.

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,090
the condition being that you're employed by me at ppth.

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,540
no, thanks.

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,320
you think it's a good idea for me to go right back to my old life?

23
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,030
for either of us?

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,890
your patient is two lungs in a box.

25
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,850
and it only has 12 hours left.

26
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,810
no pulse, no body.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,120
no ability to answer questions.

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,970
it's your perfect patient.

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,180
i did pay for the room for the whole week, but...

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,749
(foreman) donor's an 18-year-old college kid back from hofstra.

34
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,539
goes to a homecoming party with his buddies,

35
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,229
hops on his motorcycle, ends up an organ donor.
asystole in the e.r.

36
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,739
no pulse. no blood circulating.

37
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,570
his heart, liver, kidneys were all toast.

38
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,340
surgeons had the recipient on the table when they realized the lungs had increased airway resistance.

39
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,820
the team closed her up, put the lungs in suspended animation.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,910
buys 24 hours to fix it, 12 of which have passed.

41
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,850
we still have no clue what's wrong.

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,290
nice painting.

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,970
blues and greens.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,830
calming, but with a hint of nurturing.

45
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,320
totally offsets the stench of suffering and death.

46
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,270
where's my patient? we need to not talk.

47
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,910
icu isolation room.

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,150
the transplant team will meet you there with updates from the past two hours.

49
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,380
great. take this.

50
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,660
how about you drop it in your office?

51
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,940
i completely understand

52
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,620
and almost respect your desire to appear to be dean of medicine,

53
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,070
given that your title is dean of medicine.
on the other hand...

54
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,940
seriously?

55
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,450
get this straight.

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,320
you break the law, you go back to jail.
scam extra vicodin, back to jail.

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,570
flout my authority, make the hospital look bad,

58
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,730
back to jail.

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,800
i own you.

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,180
yes, massa.

61
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,680
see, that would be an example.

62
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,170
when did cuddy leave?

63
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,430
she gave her notice the day after your incident.

64
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,290
took a job-- don't need the details.

65
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,630
<i>(foreman) ortho needed more space.</i>
you're this way.

66
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,500
where's my stuff?

67
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,930
<i>(foreman) no idea.</i>

68
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,690
what about my team? pathetic.

69
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,249
the first thing you said to me was you don't want your old environment.

70
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,720
the fourth thing you said was, "where's my old environment?"

71
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,760
it's been a year.

72
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,470
taub, chase, thirteen all moved on.
the world does that sometimes.

73
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,320
no, it doesn't. here's your new office.

74
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,010
and there's your new team.

75
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,979
i'm not interested in another department's sloppy seconds.

76
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,020
i'm not sloppy seconds. 3:00 a.m.

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,379
if foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have pressed clothes,

78
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,449
coiffed hair, and makeup, which means you were already here in the hospital.

79
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,570
yes, i was on call for neurology.

80
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,250
well, if that were true, you'd be working right now

81
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,770
and unavailable to help.

82
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,090
which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work.

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,500
which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject

84
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,910
who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.

85
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,210
i am not a reject. then go back to neurology.

86
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,500
i can't.

87
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,270
i punched my attending.

88
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,920
ards secondary to trauma is our leading hypothesis.

89
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,579
fio2 is 93%--

90
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,470
prison!

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,750
<i>sorry.</i>
i thought i heard everyone else think that.

92
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,570
<i>i was in prison, you see.</i>

93
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,100
it was a long time ago, but still you're curious.

94
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,590
never was raped, <i>not raped-raped.</i>

95
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,740
well, raped-raped, but not raped-raped-raped.

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,930
well, now that we've got that completely behind us.

97
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,500
sorry, dr. house, welcome back.

98
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,730
is there cake?

99
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,880
any alveolar exudate?

100
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,609
<i>(simpson) no.</i> lungs are dry.

101
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,150
<i>well, then it's not ards.</i>

102
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,650
it's the autumn. it's tick-borne disease season.

103
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,020
ehrlichiosis causing bronchiolitis.

104
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,609
you'll appreciate that i left the "idiots" subtextual.

105
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,159
blood smear was clear, and we "idiots" treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.

106
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,010
cocaine. tox screen was clean. dead men don't pee.

107
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,230
tox screen tests for metabolites in the urine.

108
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,060
<i>coke never got past the lungs.</i>

109
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,880
also explains the motorcycle crash.

110
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,670
idiots.

111
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,879
let's get the lungs on treatment.

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,630
<i>(house) great idea.</i> <i>unless you're wrong.</i>

113
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
and by you, i mean me.
then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs.

114
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,090
i'd call you idiots again, but at this point i'm starting to doubt whether you understand what i mean by the word.

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,020
kato.

116
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,590
get black beauty and meet me out front.

117
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,290
we're gonna find the dead kid's stash.

118
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,809
since an 18-year-old with organ donor

119
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,800
on his license is not a cancer patient,

120
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,939
i'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member of the wilson cares too much club.

121
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,580
 excellent deduction. you're the reason i'm out of the big house.

122
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,299
doesn't quite make up for never visiting--

123
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,109
springing you was foreman's idea.

124
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,730
i wasn't convinced until simpson failed three times. it amounts to the same thing.

125
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,610
you wanted me back. see, i knew you'd over-interpret it.

126
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,930
strong, emotional reaction.

127
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,810
i guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you.

128
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,400
how's your wrist? healed, thank you.

129
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,330
i was wrong.

130
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,609
i went to prison. i paid the price.

131
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,169
[wilson's pager beeps] you're a changed man. i said i was wrong.

132
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,869
i didn't say i changed. i haven't. neither have you--

133
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,900
analyze it however you like. we're not friends anymore.

134
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,610
what can i do?

135
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,310
my chest. angina's back.

136
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,700
upping the nitro should knock it back down.

137
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,959
sis and i were talking, trying to figure out

138
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,560
how many hospital sleepovers we've had.

139
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,460
it definitely started with the great mastectomy of 2001.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,470
god, i miss my boobs. they were spectacular.

141
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,010
is there a chance of locating another donor?

142
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,640
it's unlikely.

143
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,260
<i>especially since, with the extent</i> of the emphysema, she needs a double lung.

144
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,960
how are you doing? better already.

145
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,600
it's a good thing that worked. i was gonna make you bring me a bottle.

146
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,570
oh, lighten up, sis.

147
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,870
you know, the least you could do is laugh at a dying lady's jokes.

148
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,070
your drinking wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.

149
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,110
because you're not dying.

150
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,790
the hospital brought in a consultant <i>to work on the lungs.</i>

151
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,660
do you know him? is he--is he good?

152
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,530
he is an excellent doctor.

153
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,110
we probably shouldn't be turning up unannounced like this.

154
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,800
their son just died.

155
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,660
bright side-- they're probably up weeping.

156
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,229
hey, we both assaulted our bosses.

157
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,809
it's like we're twins. i'd really rather not discuss it.

158
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,969
okay, i'll go first. my boss dumped me. and yours what?

159
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,520
called you his china doll?

160
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,880
joked about what a crappy deal you got for manhattan?

161
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,150
assumed you have a huge penis?

162
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,080
i have no idea what flavor you are, so i decided to cover the spread.

163
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,940
my mom's filipino, dad's korean,

164
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,770
and my boss grabbed my behind.

165
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,070
behind what?

166
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,810
oh, yeah, your-- grabbed your tushy.

167
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,209
so now you're pretending to be on call

168
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,110
so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.

169
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,610
i don't have a boyfriend. it's my parents.

170
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,230
if they found out what i've done, they'd be mortified.

171
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,960
your parents know your call schedule?

172
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,470
i live with them.

173
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,750
right.

174
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,570
no issues there.

175
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,080
i told you my son didn't do cocaine.

176
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,630
druggies are not known for their honesty.
trust me on this one.

177
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,440
mr. weathers, i am sure you're right, <i>but we need to be thorough.</i>

178
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,820
did your son ever smoke marijuana? he was an athlete.

179
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,800
took real good care of himself.

180
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,489
<i>hey, take it easy.</i> <i>steve loved all that-- sorry.</i>

181
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,460
but we're on a clock.

182
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,590
i think he's about to throw us out.

183
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,190
nope. his son is dead.

184
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,780
the only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.

185
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,570
it doesn't matter how much we piss him off as long as we find something.

186
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,470
so go back there, piss him off,

187
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
and find something.

188
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,980
do you know any of the kids at the party with your son?

189
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,540
bunch of his high school buddies.

190
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,870
<i>they'd gotten really into poker,</i>

191
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,280
decided to have an all-night game in brandon broome's basement.

192
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,740
i understand that we're in a hurry and that he's probably not going to throw us out,

193
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,010
but maybe he should.

194
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,570
your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.

195
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,470
he just got them a couple of weeks ago.

196
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,260
because he was having headaches?

197
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,420
answer the question before answering the door.

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,690
yeah, he was.

199
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,920
you're right.

200
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,120
he was not doing cocaine.

201
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,440
he had a brain tumor.

202
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,980
don't bother. it's for me.

203
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,950
turns out they monitor these monitors.

204
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,170
thank you, officer.

205
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,329
i thought the bracelet was decorative.

206
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,110
my aunt had one just like it. wait a minute.

207
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,439
you're allowed to be at the hospital. you're allowed to go home.

208
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,160
that was made clear. dead kid's house was on the way to my apartment.

209
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,509
assuming i got lost twice.

210
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,729
those consultants in my office are only costing the hospital

211
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,650
100 bucks every minute i keep them waiting.

212
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,529
why didn't you just tell me what you were doing?

213
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,249
i knew you were very busy being vaguely important.

214
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,390
i might have cleared it with the cops. yeah, it's the word "might" that bumps me.

215
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,110
but i'll run it by you next time.

216
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,370
house.

217
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,240
getting you out of jail was not a popular decision with the board.

218
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,809
i need you to solve this, and i need you to do it without making me

219
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,030
look like i can't control you.

220
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,400
for both our sakes.

221
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,960
disciplinary hearing should be fun.

222
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,440
and the subsequent lingering black mark on your record.

223
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,300
i'm not worried.

224
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,520
<i>we have to wheel this out to the mri.</i>

225
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,459
we should probably leave the body in the bag.

226
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,890
there's a mass in the arm.

227
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,220
analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.

228
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,370
so where's the next job?

229
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,670
you worry about what people think of you,

230
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,559
thus the carefully maintained hair, clothes,

231
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,210
and parental secrets.

232
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,009
the only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think

233
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,170
there's gonna be one.

234
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,190
the only way that happens is you leave princeton plainsboro.

235
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,930
i had a video interview with chicago yesterday.

236
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,640
it went well.

237
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,940
my money's on rhabdomyosarcoma.

238
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,600
chicago has a great program,

239
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,680
and you're a dumbass.

240
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,189
running away from home is a time-honored tradition,

241
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,369
but you're not doing it to flee your parents.

242
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,730
you're doing it to protect them.

243
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,680
that's an insult to everything teen prostitutes have worked for.

244
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,060
time to grow up and come clean.

245
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,140
you're right. i should just drive my car into their living room and tell them.

246
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,709
didn't it turn out that he'd stolen the hot dog cart?

247
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,450
no, borrowed. bobby was very insistent on that point.

248
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,720
seems like someone's feeling better. no more chest pain.

249
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,779
i haven't heard the name bobby in a long time. how's he doing these days?

250
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,339
i don't know. we're not in touch. and don't even pretend like you're not relieved.

251
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,550
you never liked him.

252
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,810
bobby is an incredibly fun, great guy.
just not a great influence.

253
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,050
i would have gone with "colossal drunk."

254
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,340
i was gonna leave that implied, but, yes, colossal drunk.

255
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,040
what? it's good for a couple to share a hobby.

256
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,310
your catheter bag is empty, despite taking in 200 ccs of fluids.

257
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,870
i'm gonna have to dial back the nitro.

258
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,440
won't her chest pain come back? we don't have any choice.

259
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,620
the nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys.

260
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,930
<i>they're shutting down.</i>

261
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,340
* near, far

262
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,520
* wherever you are

263
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,309
* i believe

264
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,950
this is so our song.

265
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:34,290
* that the heart does go on *

266
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,519
my patient is running out of time.

267
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,360
not worried.

268
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,569
my team is confirming the diagnosis as we speak.

269
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,470
* you open the door

270
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,649
i want to be understanding.

271
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,630
it's your first day back-- see? i smell empathy.

272
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,849
* and you're here

273
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,450
you should remember all the good times.

274
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,439
* in my heart

275
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,120
like when i gave you that necklace that you just dumped in the ocean.

276
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,690
what were you thinking? my heart will go on

277
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,739
house, i haven't forgotten our friendship.

278
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,650
for every good memory, there's a slew of bad ones.

279
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:09,990
come in. come in.

280
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,809
paraneoplastic syndrome's out. the lung donor didn't have cancer.

281
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,709
tell that to the tumor that i found in his arm. <i>that mass wasn't a tumor.</i>

282
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,529
it was coagulated plasma. e.r. pumped him full of it.

283
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,900
<i>i.v. leaked into his arm.</i> i even did a complete mri.

284
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,670
no cancer anywhere.

285
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,560
we've got nothing.

286
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,080
just 'cause it wasn't a tumor

287
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,150
doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs.

288
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,020
they're reacting to something in the plasma.

289
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,870
<i>but every unit of plasma</i> can have up to 25 contributing donors.

290
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,140
we need to track down all of them.

291
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,070
still.

292
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,870
it's not as bad as a thousand people going down in a gigantic boat, right?

293
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,940
my heart will go on.

294
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,720
no, you can't leave the hospital.

295
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,819
25 donors contributed to the plasma

296
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,090
that the lung donor got.

297
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,059
my team cannot track down and interview them all in six hours.

298
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,719
i vouch for you to the cops, you take some parole-violating detour

299
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,160
celebrating your freedom, justified, of course,

300
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,459
by some absurd theory connecting it to the case.

301
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,910
you asked me to ask you.

302
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,090
was that just so you'd enjoy saying no?

303
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,960
i don't trust you, house. i can't.

304
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,970
actually you have to.

305
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,780
not absolutely. not outside the walls of this hospital.

306
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,899
fine, then give me a team i don't have to put in quotation marks.

307
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
use the people already on the case.

308
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,930
give me chase, taub, thirteen. we don't have the money to pay them.

309
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,169
it went to interior designers, i understand.

310
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,400
you only have park because she's on neurology's tab.

311
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,620
you are making minimum wage. i am?

312
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,160
get out of my office, please.

313
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,640
what do you got?

314
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,689
number three went to a baseball game <i>the day before he donated.</i>

315
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,219
boredom is not transmissible.

316
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,090
he ate a bag of peanuts, and peanut proteins would be.

317
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,529
if our donor had an allergy,

318
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,380
it could explain the lungs. nice.

319
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,310
what?

320
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,079
<i>(house) nothing.</i> don't start that.

321
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,000
<i>(house) start what?</i>

322
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,700
i'm enjoying our conversation. the repartee.

323
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,270
there was no repartee. that was repartee.

324
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,829
i'm not doing this for you.

325
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,430
i'm doing it to help my patient.

326
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,280
it's just good to hear your voice.

327
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,040
good-bye.

328
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,610
that's my whiteboard. i need it.

329
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,330
and he really doesn't care how the cast comes off.

330
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,680
dr. foreman warned us that you'd try something.

331
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,120
told me to call him if you did.

332
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,750
i'd like to do that.

333
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,880
i'll take this outside.

334
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,710
(park) donor six traveled to thailand around khorat.

335
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,250
region was endemic with dengue fever.

336
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,080
good.

337
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,420
<i>yeah. (park) alcohol.</i>

338
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,420
well, you'd have to be pretty drunk
for it to affect a pool of plasma.

339
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,970
these guys have got that covered.
<i>acute etoh ingestion could have--</i>

340
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,150
<i>hey, paint around them!</i>

341
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,980
they're not hurting anyone!
who's painting?

342
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,400
<i>(park) the crew's just starting.</i>

343
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,090
<i>paint fumes didn't cause contamination.</i>

344
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,180
but maybe the old paint did.

345
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,800
they scraped off the underpass, probably because it contains...

346
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,170
(both) lead.

347
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,600
chest pain back? worse this time.

348
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,420
is there any way to take the edge off?

349
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,179
we're still working on the lungs.

350
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,120
we should know soon.

351
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,080
soon is good.

352
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,610
how's the chelation going?

353
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,240
reverend moon started it about 20 minutes ago.

354
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,630
you missed lunch tracking down the plasma donors.

355
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,780
got you a reuben from the cafeteria.

356
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,670
thanks.

357
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,550
lead exposure's a nice diagnosis. i hope it pays off.

358
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,040
it will.

359
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
i appreciate your confidence, but she's not really--

360
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,160
oh, no, she could die.

361
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,010
but technically it will still pay off.

362
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,290
even if your patient dies, someone will get the lungs.

363
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,560
you really haven't changed.

364
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,210
but i've given up red meat.

365
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,140
what round of chelation is this? fourth.

366
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,890
are you checking up on me or on house?

367
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,840
this case.

368
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,250
unique situation. oxygenating?

369
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,090
98%. airway resistance down.

370
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,780
great. is house okay?

371
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,800
i have no idea.

372
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,160
dad, what are you doing here? got your text.

373
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,060
i brought you some of your mother's gomguk. what text?

374
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,570
the one asking me to bring you some dinner.

375
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,510
i went by neurology.

376
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,230
the secretary said you were on leave.

377
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,220
i'm consulting on this case. unique situation.

378
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,290
it looks very complicated.

379
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,890
you can help with that?

380
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,210
lungs are crashing. i have to go.

381
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,450
bye.

382
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,239
<i>(foreman) increasing to 100% fio2.</i>

383
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,819
saline flow is down to 10 ccs.

384
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,149
blockage? clot in the line? chelation is making it worse.

385
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,559
it means we were wrong about lead.

386
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,480
hold the analysis and help me save this thing.

387
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,220
saline's flushing it forward but getting no return.

388
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,840
one-way valve. vasospasm.

389
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,810
if you're right, calcium channel blocker should relax the artery.

390
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,280
<i>the lungs have no nervous system.</i> will that still work?

391
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,660
we'll know soon.

392
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,050
saline flow's rising.

393
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,280
vasospasm's relaxing.

394
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,340
left lung is pinking up.

395
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,080
good job.

396
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,220
right middle lobe isn't.

397
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:55,990
nothing.

398
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,970
we killed part of the lung.

399
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,950
page dr. pinto stat to the cath lab.
we're going to the cath lab?

400
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,940
are you thinking that maybe--
what? who?

401
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,340
one dead lobe means four alive ones.

402
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,850
it means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.

403
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,230
it makes sense. unlike you stealing my phone.

404
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,250
you have unlimited texting.

405
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,160
until your parents know, you will never see that punch for what it really was.

406
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,280
your february 4th.

407
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,130
sri lankan independence day.

408
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,029
i told you i'm korean and filipino.

409
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,490
and i told you i wasn't listening.

410
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,180
by my actions.

411
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,179
violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict.
it was a moment of weakness.

412
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,590
you barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew.

413
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,200
maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw.

414
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,530
maybe it's your character. pinto! house.

415
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,290
embrace your inner bitch.

416
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,850
so why did chelation make the lungs worse?

417
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,669
we got about five minutes till pinto gets back.

418
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,090
give me a hand with this. no.

419
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,260
i tracked down another bag of plasma from the batch they used on the donor.

420
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,860
negative for all our other exposures.

421
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,110
sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment.

422
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,590
i am a cripple in need of assistance.

423
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,850
transplant team ran an a.c.e.

424
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,209
<i>negative. it's mine.</i> and it's your job.

425
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,820
my job is to assist you in curing the lungs.
this chair will help me do that.

426
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,879
what if the scrapings from the bridge

427
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,569
contained other heavy metals like beryllium or asbestos?

428
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,030
chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.

429
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,880
but...

430
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,140
maybe the problem isn't a heavy metal from outside.

431
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,670
it's inside.
but it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to.

432
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,000
it's stuck.

433
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,650
iron.

434
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,280
the donor had hemosiderosis. his body wasn't disposing of iron.

435
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,419
massive amounts choke up the lungs.

436
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,079
then our chelation would wreak havoc because it picks up too much stuff.

437
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,370
go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.

438
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,300
i'm sorry, young lady, i simply will not help you steal this chair.

439
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,890
pinto. house.

440
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,800
she can barely catch her breath.

441
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,430
lungs ready yet?

442
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,190
we had a small setback. we're testing for iron overload.

443
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,580
i thought it was lead. this is not an exact process.

444
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,650
your small airways are collapsing.

445
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,880
you're not getting enough oxygen.

446
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,550
i'd like to try forcing an oxygen-rich slurry into your lungs.

447
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,010
it should open up the airways and buy you some time until the lungs are ready.

448
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,200
fluid? in my lungs?

449
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,140
sounds like drowning.

450
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,010
it is.

451
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,680
gonna hurt, isn't it?

452
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
yes. a fair amount.

453
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
no.

454
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,810
i'm done.

455
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,990
<i>(wilson) house, the nurses saw you come in.</i>

456
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,290
enter.

457
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,710
<i>it's a bathroom.</i>

458
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,150
ah, explains the hole in this chair.

459
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,290
god, i missed doors.

460
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,640
and air freshener.

461
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,550
now go away.

462
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,230
i'm waiting for some test results.

463
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,200
my patient signed a dnr. she's giving up.

464
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,940
looks like someone else will be getting the lungs.

465
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,519
making this yet another interaction with you in which i get nothing.

466
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,760
it's not my fault you can't handle your patient.

467
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,120
she said she's done.

468
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,669
i spent half an hour trying to change her mind, but she'd made her decision.

469
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,960
i accepted that. it's called respect. well, what's after respect?

470
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,360
<i>you find another angle.</i>

471
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,050
<i>you hold her hand,</i> get the sister to beg,

472
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,680
stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear.

473
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,250
you do whatever it takes. oh, whatever it takes.

474
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,230
thanks, house. i hadn't thought of that.

475
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,940
what are you testing for? hemosiderosis.

476
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,520
i'm staining for excess iron.

477
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,660
promising.

478
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,480
when your dad showed up unexpectedly, house have a hand in that?

479
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,640
i'm guessing he does things like that a lot.

480
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,870
his version of a compliment.

481
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,040
i spoke to the head of neurology in chicago.

482
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,490
i gave you a good recommendation. did you mention what happened?

483
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,530
lawyers say i'm not allowed to.

484
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,640
it works out well for everyone.

485
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,710
why exactly is that good for you?

486
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,940
excuse me?

487
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,270
i'm a talented physician, top 2% of my class.

488
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,309
i'm an asset to this hospital, an asset you're about to lose to chicago.

489
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,569
you applied for the job. you asked me to call and recommend you.

490
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,170
andrews is the one that should leave. he's the supervisor.

491
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,919
he touched me first. i can't discuss any of that,

492
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,080
not before the hearing.

493
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,340
but if you're having doubts about chicago, i can call them back.

494
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,850
no. thank you.

495
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,450
dr. foreman?

496
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,450
<i>would you look at this?</i>

497
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,430
iron? <i>no.</i>

498
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,040
<i>white blood cells.</i>

499
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,950
classic presentation of infection.
how the hell did we miss that?

500
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,800
<i>(park) biopsy revealed white blood cell infiltrates.</i>

501
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,750
infection was right after all.

502
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,249
fresh fruit in prison is usually chicken.
why aren't you more alarmed?

503
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,180
we're running out of time.
aahh, she's dying!

504
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,900
were you able to figure out what was wrong while i was screaming?

505
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,939
infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.

506
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,690
which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open.

507
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,840
if they're hiding inside the lung cells... i'm thinking brucella.

508
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,200
and to wipe that out, you need special ops.

509
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,370
an intact immune system.

510
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,770
but that's what white blood cells are.

511
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,270
they're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry.

512
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,490
but those lungs need the air force and the marines,

513
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,120
antibodies raining down from above.

514
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,610
antibiotics and ivig.

515
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,450
did you use metaphors for your old team?

516
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,300
or do you just think i'm particularly stupid?

517
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,880
no, they were stupid too.

518
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
what are you doing here?

519
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,429
i'm here for vanessa.

520
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:02,220
now is not the time, bobby. she asked me to come.

521
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,470
right, doc?

522
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,560
actually, it was my idea.

523
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,039
what? what were you thinking? she doesn't want to see him.

524
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,969
when vanessa was ready to quit chemo, bobby's the one <i>who got her to do one more round.</i>

525
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,660
yeah, and then he got her drunk.

526
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,560
at least tell me you haven't been drinking today.

527
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,730
i should go. yeah.

528
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,140
hail, hail, the gang's all here.

529
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,370
case is under control.

530
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,230
it's me time.

531
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,980
vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry.

532
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,190
you were right to push me.

533
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,500
i needed that. thank you.

534
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,330
so we're good?

535
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,160
it was good advice.

536
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,380
just came here to say thank you.

537
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,240
i like you. <i>i have fun with you.</i>

538
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,569
and, if you can honestly say that you don't like me,

539
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,540
you don't have fun with me, i can accept that.

540
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,260
but just do whatever you have to do to get over this.

541
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,830
you can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts.

542
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,560
either/or.
both seems excessive.

543
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,620
the thing is, house...

544
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,060
i don't like you.

545
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,650
when did the discoloration start?
a few minutes after i started the ivig.

546
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,570
means we're wrong about infection.

547
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,450
and by we, you mean you. you screwed up the lungs.

548
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,680
wrong about autoimmune, not cancer,

549
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,120
heavy metals, genetic issues...

550
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,680
increase peep. already maxed out.

551
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,409
we're close to the point of no return.

552
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,410
the lungs will never be viable for transplant.

553
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,590
i need...

554
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,000
i need ideas.

555
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,640
iga nephropathy.

556
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,490
that's already ruled out.

557
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,310
lupus. no.

558
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,860
maybe we're just out of time.

559
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,880
we're out of time when we're out of time.
when they die or she dies.

560
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,100
keep them stable as long as you can.

561
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:21,880
i need to think.

562
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,870
the lungs are a smoker.

563
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,419
you of all people should know better.

564
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,240
but the kid never smoked. he played poker.

565
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,080
who plays poker without cigars?

566
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,590
even if he didn't light up himself...

567
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,580
it was a rainy night. the windows were closed.

568
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,480
all parents think their kids are special.

569
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,679
and these ones were right.
at least his white blood cells were special.

570
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,720
they had on on switch for reacting to smoke, but no off.

571
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,439
when he inhaled small amounts of smoke, he had small problems.
no one even noticed.

572
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,370
big amounts of smoke, that's enough to trash a lung.

573
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,360
as soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke,

574
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,650
he was a dead man.

575
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:28,100
the motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish.

576
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,050
eosiniphilic pneumonitis.

577
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,840
but the steroids would have treated for that.

578
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,320
i was right. not about anything medical,

579
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,070
but my metaphors were perfect.

580
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,310
we need to hit it harder.

581
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,519
we need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg.

582
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,759
we need the nuclear option.

583
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,119
at some point you're going to say we need to radiate, right?

584
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,670
see, the metaphors work.
but that'll destroy the good lung too.

585
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,559
better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.

586
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,420
won't be fast enough. wilson needs these lungs.

587
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,580
it's working.

588
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,620
he did it.

589
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,760
i'm not going to chicago.

590
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,620
if you stay, we have to have a hearing.

591
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,040
i know.

592
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,210
dad...

593
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,990
do you have a minute?

594
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,710
(simpson) thoracic cavity clear. ready for the donor lungs.

595
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,750
thank god you called him.

596
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,220
i wonder what happens now.

597
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,830
she can handle it.

598
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,490
<i>(foreman) house.</i>

599
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,920
got something for you.

600
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,940
i found your stuff in storage.

601
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,640
<i>this is all you get.</i>

602
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,840
ortho still has the outer office.

603
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,960
well, that sucks.

604
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,520
where are chase, taub, and thirteen gonna sit?
you're welcome, house.

605
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,760
dinner later? i'll pick something up.

606
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,090
i heard about a good new vegetarian place.

607
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,230
screw that. i want a steak.

608
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,050
i'll meet you at your place at 8:00.

609
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:50,670
