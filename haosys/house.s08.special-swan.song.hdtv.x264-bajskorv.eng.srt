78
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,040
and had so much interaction with this character,

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,170
that we had to really get that character perfectly,

I feel as if I know who this guy is, the character of House,

84

No. That's a lie.

(HIS SHIRT)just slightly less than 100.

114
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,450
(KATIE???)Well, first of all, he was not always walking around with a cane.

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,270
In fact, we pictured him in a wheelchair.

116
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,070
But a wheelchair is not the best idea,

117
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,850
because of the obvious limitations.

118
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,960
So then we briefly considered a scar...

119
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,700
and then a cane.

120
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,380
Knowing that it was a cane and knowing that I wanted someone

121
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,170
who could walk down those halls and hold the center,

122
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,420
you know, height became important, and physicality became important.

123
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,460
The truth is he's hiding, because he's handicapped.

124
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,580
That was where it all sort of started from.

You've got three overqualified doctors working for you, getting bored.

127

I don't need a team.

You were bouncing ideas off a janitor. Come on. Gotta earn that fiver.

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,650
The thing that I find interesting about House

131
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,940
as a character is his, uh, distance

132
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,760
and his apathy and his, um,

133
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,500

You're living in the same apartment for 15 years.

You drive a 10-year-old car. You are not good with change.

138
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,300
That used to be true, but I changed.

139
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,580

As an audience member, we know these characters

142

and to see them placed in their individual situations

143
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,310
and their-their quirks

144

and, uh, you know, their personalities come through.

Have you even interviewed anybody?

146

You test-drive a car before you buy it. You have sex before you get married.

I can't hire a team based on a 10-minute interview.

What if I don't like having sex with 'em?

149
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,200
I love it. I think-I enjoy the humor of our writers.

150
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,710
I mean, they are so clever. And just what we get away with sometimes-

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,820
<i>Every ship has its engine room.</i>

154
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,830
<i>Every restaurant has its kitchen.</i>

155
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,380
<i>And every TV show has people-</i>

156
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,860
(HOUSE ???)<i>I don't know what they do.</i>

157
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,100
What do you do in here? I make the trains run on time.

158
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,150
Every rule gets followed. Yeah, they're apparent.

159
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,320
Every rule is followed.

GERRIT VAN DER MEER
CO-EXECTIVE PRODUCER

161
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,450
You have to, um, you know, be inventive to make it work.

162
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,640
Like, when we did the Coast Guard rescue at sea...

163
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,220
Unbelievable. One of our people thought that we had to bring in a real helicopter(MARCY KAPLAN PRODUCER)

164
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,140
over the tank in Pacoima, but that was a process.

165
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,750
It's getting- You're spoiling the magic, Marcy.

166
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,680
(JON COHOE ???)That's more invoices than I've even seen in my life,

167
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,740
(THE MONEY GUY)never mind gone through for a single show.

HOUSE 
JEREMY CASSELLS PRODCUTION DESIGNER

169
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,620
It says "production designer. " What it means is, uh, genius.

170
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,060
<i>Behind sets like these</i>

171
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,340
(THE ART DEPARTMENT)<i>are people like them.</i>

172
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,930
What do you think was your biggest, uh, the biggest challenge?

173
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,140
Mayfield was probably the most fun, I think.

174
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,310
You sort of built a wing of a hospital.

175
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.???

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,120
Right. We did a whole world. We did the exterior.

177
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
We did the interior. That was fun. Yeah.

178
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
"'Broken'

179
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240

BROKEN

185

You don't care about anything, House.

186
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm transferring you to Winslow Psychiatric.

187
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,090
You'll have better luck pulling the wool over their eyes.

188
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,370
I'm done.

189
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,610
Don't.

190
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,470
I need help.

191
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,380
We're all worried my hero, House,

192
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,680
is, you know, in trouble, and he's going to a psychiatric hospital.

193
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,370
And you should also welcome Greg to the floor.

194
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,590
Don't worry about the name. Just passing through.

195
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,060
I love "Broken. " I think it gave the whole-

196
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,480
not just the season, but the whole six years-

197
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,130
it gave that a sort of shape and a meaning and, uh, a kind of truth.

198
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,130
I- I, uh, yes. Yeah, a kind of truth.

199
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,280
Don't want to break any hearts. Can we go outside?

200
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,460
We built an entire mental facility.

201
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,320
Okay. He's the claustrophobic one, right?

202
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,170
(a pox on our house)We constructed a slave ship.

203
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,740
(stephen howard???)As the show got more successful, it seemed like we built a lot more.

204
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,000
We provided work for really thousands of people

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,610
in the seven years that I've been here.

206
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,980
It's made a lot of people very happy.

207
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,850
construction

208
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,210
<i>And, lo, the sets were good.</i>

209
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,300
This is Jesse's last time he ever wears this.

210
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,090
- It is the last time I ever wear it. Look. - Yeah, this is-

211
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,000
that's me when I was-yeah. Jesse was 12, and now he's 19.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,460
You look great, Peter.

213
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,070
Don't let the fans tell you you don't.

214
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,910
The difference is that I actually look like a doctor.

215
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,480
Now whose blood is it, really?

216
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,500
- O, a-negative... - It's mostly food coloring...

217
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,170
And positive. And, uh, corn syrup.

218
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,050
How long do you think you'll work for House?

219
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,590
post mortem

220
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,320
As long as he lets me. All our instruments are basically real,

221
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,490
but as you can see, we have tons and tons of...

222
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,120
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi. Ay-yi-yi. That come out.

223
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,090
Look at it. God, it's endless.

224
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,490
- And cut. Great, Peter. You happy? - Yep.

225
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,650
- Oh, good. - All right, cutting.

226
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,450
 I'm gonna miss surgery and Jeffrey...

227
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,780
This is your last surgery. This is my last surgery.

228
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,630
(out of the chute)Slow the heart down so it doesn't-

229
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,100
Damn. Clamp. The leak is too fast.

230
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,730
No, it's not. We can fix this.

231
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,090
It worked.

232
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,290
Omar, in my opinion, on the show he has taken - the worst... - Yes, he has taken it the worst.

233
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,870
(EDDIE GRISECO PROP MASTER)Having the exploding colon... Why is that?

234
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,870
I remember that. Because he's such a tense character.

235
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,190
Maybe a little more pressure.

236
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,180
Not too much. If it is the end and we-

237
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,770
Yeah, let's do the high five.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,030
Well, you're wrong, and-

239
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,660
either you're right, and your friend is...

240
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,920
We record it on the day.

241
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,860
(VON VARGA)We know right away it's going to A.D.R.

242
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,070
He sees it. He sees it. He sees it.

243
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,300
We hope that Peter gets it. He sees it.

244
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,290
He sees it! Did you get anything there that'll work?

245
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,130
I think one and two... One and two work.

246
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,060
May be the lone wolf on set. He gets left out.

247
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,870
So we invite him in here as much as possible so he feels at home. 

248
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,890
I've always been surprised at just how smoothly and respectfully

249
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,940
you guys all work together.

250
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,150
It's pretty unbelievable. It really is amazing.

251
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,440
'Cause the actors hate each other. Say the line. Say the line.

252
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,010
You know, to be honest, it's kind of nice walking into a hair and makeup trailer

253
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,850
and knowing that you're gonna get made up, and you don't have to do a thing.

254
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,280
You just sit in that chair, relax, and let Marianna do her work.

255
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,660
(MARIANNA ELIAS ???)- They're so great. - Talk about Charlyne.

256
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,820
Charlyne's the troublemaker of the trailer. Yes.

257
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,080
The girls are in here. It's very calm.

258
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,210
It's a calm environment until the guys get in here,

259
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,620
and then all of 'em come in at once, and then it's sort of nuts.

260
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,260
I'd like to be able to just sit back and do sudoku

261
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,660
and be as quiet as Omar, but I-it's just not in my nature.

262
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,830
And I'm gonna miss, you know, Jesse and, uh,

263
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,780
(BRIGITTE???)Jesse was always really willing to-to kibbutz along with me.

264
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,780
(THE SHY ONE)Do you know how to-do you know what "kibbutzing" means? Yes.

265
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,400
Yeah. I like to kibbutz in the makeup trailer.

266
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,030
Everybody gets along very well. It's very much like a family.

267
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:05,420
I mean, after all, we are spending more time with our crew and our cast

268
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,170
and everybody in production more than our families.

269
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,500
So it's a good thing we get along.

270
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,090
You hang out a-much longer than you need to be in here for.

271
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,320
- I mean, you- you actually like us. - It's 'cause I'm lonely.

272
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,370
It's 'cause I'm sad and lonely. Oh, yeah, there's that.

273
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,680
(kevin williams???)First thing we're gonna shoot is with our real actors, with Charlyne for sure.

274
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,780
Then the stunt people will take over.

275
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,230
(stunt people )(wimps)Three, two, one, action.

276
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,490
Effects is hot. Here we go. Action.

277
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,820
It was, like, not a big deal, right?

278
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,370
Yeah, it was totally not a big deal. Like, whatever.

279
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,160
It was totally fine. I have five days left.

280
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,760
Five days, dude.

281
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,140
*Five, six, seven, eight *

282
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,470
<i>Well, enough with the pampering.</i>

283
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,950
<i>Making me look good takes real work.</i>

284
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,550
(dalia dokter??)And what you have to do to me is a trifle compared to these guys.

285
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,890
Stabbed, shot,

286
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,080
electrocuted... Dr. House!

287
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,020
Poisoned, overdosed,

288
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,240
cardiac arrest, leg surgery-self-administered. I died for a while.

289
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,420
(steve galloway)Oh, my God, his blood pressure is dropping.

290
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,270
Sometimes they just don't make it.

291
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,700
<i>It may look relaxed,</i> <i>but these fellows have been working</i>

292
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,930
<i>since about 4:00 in the morning,</i> <i>and they have power tools.</i>

293
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,580
- All set. - "Come Fly 'House'" wasn't it?

294
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,760
(CHRISTINE DANAHY???)Tell me what that sign means. This means it's acting time.

295
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,520
And... action.

296
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,790
'Cause the only cage I see is right there.

297
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,670
Thoughts, Gary? Three days to go.

298
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,330
A look back, poignant memories?

299
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,810
(GARY COTTI???)I look forward to three really, uh, busy days...

300
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,830
Yeah. And a quality final episode and a handshake and a hug and a good-bye

301
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,800
and a "good luck. "

302

00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,920
<i>They can either read the words, or you can hit them with it.</i>

305
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,060
THANK YOU

306
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,350
$5 Friday folks, step on up and tuck a buck.

307
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,030
It could be your lucky day, brother!

308
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,340
I think next, we can- we'll do this section first.

309
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,670
Even before the director starts placing the shots

310
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,550
(MONTY WOODARD??? LIOYD BARCROFT???)
or whatever, the crew's already out.

311
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,770
*Go on, sugar *

312
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,570
* and move on down the road *

313
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,070
What do your friends think you do during the day?

314
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,480
(JUNE PARK??)Do you tell 'em you work on something else?

315
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,910
We spend a lot of time here, and we like to have fun,

316
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,920
so... Yeah, we have a lot of fun on the set.

317
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,160
All right, so, ladies and gentlemen,

318
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,500
our final $5 Friday on "House. "

319
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,990
$2,865.

320
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,880
I want to thank everybody for participating.

321
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,950
God, the pressure.

322
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,350
Ron- Ron, Drew, and Christine!

323
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,200
Ron, Drew, and Christine!

324
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,650
Heck, yeah! Thank you very much, everybody!

325
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,570
Bravo. I love you all!

326
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,790
CLOWN ENTERS????

327
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,280
<i>House as a character</i>

328
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,890
<i>is a strong cup of coffee.</i>

329

DEFENDING HOUSE

331
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,820
You are Hugh Laurie. I am.

332
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,540
(RUSSEL FRIEND??)You portray the character Dr. Gregory House.

333
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,540
I do???did.

334
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,990
You're English. I am English, yes.

335
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,960
I'm a citizen of the United Kingdom, a subject of her majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

336
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,240
Hey. We're wondering if you can clarify a few things about this character, 

337
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,450
about his personality, about his methods. I'll do my best.

338
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,770
I can give you some examples.

339
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,990
I'd like to hear them from your mouth, yes.

340
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,820
Frankly, sometimes he just seems like he's being mean.

341
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,820
What are you looking at? Apparently a moron.

342
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,850
You're a moron.

343
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,930
Chicago has a great program, and you're a dumb-ass.

344
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,810
(TOMMY MORAN???)Was there a point to that, do you think?

345
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,510
Well...

346
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,040
Yes. Sorry.

347
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,910
Stuck a thermometer up Detective Tritter's rear end.

348
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,590
Anus. Oh!

349
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,970
And his hiring practices

350
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,210
are not much more than an opportunity to mock.

351
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,160
Good. Then can we do a Secret Santa?

352
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,290
I liked you better 15 seconds ago when you were afraid for your job.

353
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,350
If people find these working conditions intolerable,
they're free to leave.

354
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,950
They can submit their notice, and occasionally some of them do.

355
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,670
I didn't fail. You fired me. Repeatedly.

356
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,080
But if you walk away now, after I just rehired you,

357
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,970
that's quitting.

358
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,100
I love the world of "House. "

359
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,430
It can go from the broadly comic

360
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,330
to the angry satire

361
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,080
to the sort of gut-wrenching tragedy

362
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,710
to a horror movie,

363
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,160
um, in the space of seconds.

364
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,740
HELP ME 

365
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,710
Can anybody hear me?

366
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,390
Can anybody hear me?

367
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,300
(PETER BLAKE???)"Interior. The hole- night.

368
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,240
"Cuddy, field amputation kit at her side,

369
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,670
"is talking to intransigent Hanna.

370
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,920
"Her angiocath has been removed.

371
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,780
"Hanna. 'No. Dr. House promised. '

372
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,100
Cuddy. 'If there was... '" If there was any other way...

373
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,100
It doesn't hurt right now. I can wait.

374
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,080
It was an enormously tight space.

375
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,280
(GREG YAITANES???)There was about 18 inches of actual set.

376
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,800
So if you're in there, you have to crawl around on your belly.

377
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,520
You have to act in the actual space. It's not made any bigger for camera.

378
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,130
We really wanted to be inside Hugh's head.

379
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,550
This shallow depth of field- it's quite stunning.

380
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,770
The focus was unbelievably difficult
for our assistant cameraman.

381
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,790
Sometimes we're dealing with literally focus, you know, of half an inch.

382
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,350
Literally, if you just breathe with the camera, you're soft in your shot. You're soft.

383
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,210
We took that camera and put it where it had never been before.

384
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,400
What we shot...

385
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,340
(ROB CARLSON???/DON CARLSON???)Right. Yeah. In a whole show forced us to really think out of the box.

386
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,570
And I was uncharacteristically emotional when we were shooting,

387
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,440
because the scene itself is heartbreaking,

388
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,660
and the characters devastated me in that scene.

389
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,710
I always thought if I did the right thing,

390
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,890
if I treated people right, then good things would happen to me.

391
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,190
You think that's how it works?

392
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,980
I think it used to.

393
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,580
Now I don't know.

394
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,260
I love the week-to-week of the show, but I really want to know what this guy is about.

395
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,520
I want to know Lisa Cuddy better.

396
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,060
I want to know who these people are,

397
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,510
and I want to know what they're like in situations

398
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,970
when they're taken outside their everyday environment.

399
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,950
What? It's not a clot.

400
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,210
It's a fat embolism from the amputation. What can we do?

401
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,380
Do something. Please. Please, do something.

402
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,010
Please, come on, do something!

403
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,270
This wasn't your fault. That's the point!

404
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,790
I did everything right. She died anyway.

405
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,730
Why the hell do you think that would make me feel any better?

406
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,010
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

407
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,760
You think I can fix myself?

408
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,630
I don't know.

409
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,980
'Cause I'm the most screwed-up person in the world.

410
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,270
I know.

411
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,600
I love you.

412
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,680
I think this is the unending challenge of trying to love someone like House.

413
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,140
You may not think him worth loving. I personally do.

414
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,910
I do love him and think him worth loving.

415
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,350
THE CASE OF HUDDY

416
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,000
Figure out a way to resolve our differences.
There already is a mechanism for that.

417
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,120
You're laughing. Stop.

418
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,220
The House/Cuddy relationship I've always thought had layers to it.

419
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,300
I think in the pilot it's clear that it has a history.

420
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,860
It's 5:00. I'm going home.

421
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,410
To what? Nice.

422
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,470
Trying to convince an insane person

423
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,750
not to do insane things is in itself insane.

424
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,870
You can't stop our love!

425
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,020
The fun is in watching them, uh, struggle. - No!

426
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,710
The fun is watching them struggle not getting together

427
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,000
or maybe getting together or thinking about getting together.

428
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,770
Actually being together might not be much fun.

429
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,720
People who get close to you get hurt. That's a fact.

430
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,100
I slept with Cuddy.

431
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,070
This is fantastic. How are you gonna screw it up?

432
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,980
I feel hurt.

433
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,470
It didn't really necessarily get explored for a long time,

434
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,950
but to me, it was always there.

435
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,960
You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's house

436
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,850
and then fled the country for three months.

437
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,500
Are you sorry about what you did? Yes.

438
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,750
We need you to show us remorse.

439
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,210
Is that how our system works?

440
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,800
Release the best actors?

441
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,820
Everyone has a very specific and personal experience with House.

442
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,970
Pull my ribbon, if you know what I mean.

443
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,720
That's not what I meant. House.

444
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,150
"'House's Head. ' Scene 54.

445
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,310
"Interior. Bus. Driving- night.

Why are you here? There must be a reason?

HOUSE'S HEAD

452
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,510
You have something to tell me.

453
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,240
Yes. Who am I? Why the guessing game?

454
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,730
Because you don't know the answer.

455
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,500
What's my necklace made of? You know the clues.

456
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,200
Who am I?

457
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,810
Amber?

458
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,980
(ELAN SOLTES???)On the one hand, we had a practical bus,

459
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,500
but when it was a flashback or an hallucination,

460
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,250
then it was surreal.

461
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,290
And then suddenly, it becomes real at the very end.

462
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,750
Removing the safety clamps!

463
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,260
Everything in the production needed to be coordinated.

464
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,020
We rehearsed this stunt, you know, in its entirety,

465
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,080
from flipping this gimbal rig all the way over.

466
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,300
(JIM VICKERS???)And then once we've eliminated all the variables

467
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,070
and know where people are gonna land basically

468
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,350
and what they're gonna need as far as safety goes,

469
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,200
I put all the elements together,

470
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,030
and then we turned it over with everybody.

471
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,430
In the very ultimate thing with Amber,

472
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,550
we had background that was shot practically.

473
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,820
We added a C.G. dump truck to the background.

474
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,470
We also had our special effects people throwing rubber glass through the window.

475
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,490
Through the use of physical models

476
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,370
(ALLEN MARSHALL PALMER???)and things that are created entirely in the computer,

477
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,080
he was able to create that world.

478
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,440
We had fans going, lots and lots of bits and pieces.

479
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,750
There's that moment where Amber-

480
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,760
It's the point of impact when the bus was hit,

481
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,150
and her body going forward-

482
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,780
I thought that was extraordinary.

483
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,740
Good thing I brought my ax cane.

484
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,850
I'm David Shore, and I've done 177 episodes.

485
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,870
Robert Sean Leonard. I play Wilson,
and, uh, it's been 177 episodes.

486
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,160
House. 177 episodes.

487
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,810
Uh, Omar Epps, Foreman pilot.

488
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,610
Um, 265 episodes?

489
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,240
I think I'm, like, 98. 21 episodes.

490
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,550
We start the final episode on House's face,

491
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,820
completely passed out on the floor.

492
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,910
And as we go to frame, we end the series.

493
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,020
I know I was grumpy today.

494
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:11,690
I was just trying to hold it together, because that was a very, very emotional moment.

495
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,230
We'd come right to the end.

496
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,830
Downtown somewhere in L.A.

497
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,680
I have no clue where I'm at.

498
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,320
These are the last days.

499
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,810
There are so many different layers to the show.

500
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,170
There's sound. There's the acting. There's the directing.

501
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,940
There's the writing. There's the casting.

502
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,700
There's the wardrobe. There's the makeup.

503
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,430
There's the special effects, so many different components

504
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,640
working towards a common theme in every frame of the show.

505
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,070
I am wearing pants with dogs on them,

506
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,540
and the reason for that is I'm sick. I have the flu.

507
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,670
I arrived here at 6:30 p. m., which is my call.

508
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,510
I think we're shooting till 4:30 a. m.

509
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:15,000
I've gotta work with Omar, which always makes me slightly sleepy, just his acting style.

510
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,670
We go to war, baby.

511
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,860
Our department's interfaced with the public.

512
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,250
(NANCY HAECKER???)We do so much prep work and so much groundwork everything's on a deadline.

513
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,080
 (STEVE DE LEON???)It's a lot of fun. 12 different departments on time, ready to go,

514
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,830
with every single piece of equipment.

515
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,710
They're like the marines. They're the first ones in.

516
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,030
So you guys like when we wrap early. Oh, yeah.

517
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,010
That's what it's all about.

518
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,770
<i>If you want to know people well,</i> <i>you should see them at 5:00 in the morning.</i>

519
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,420
<i>You'll either like them more or less.</i>

520
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,290
<i>With these people, it's definitely more.</i>

521
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,020
Cut!

522
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,740
I only want to say as we go into the last show that we will ever make,

523
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,620
that none of us really get a chance to look each other in the eye and say

524
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,420
"that was an incredible thing that you did. "

525
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,820
That there was a set that was drawn on a Monday,

526
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,070
built on a Tuesday, and acted on on a Wednesday is just mind-bending.

527
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,400
 This show belongs to all of us,

528
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,940
and it's something I'm extraordinarily proud of.

529
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,280
Three, two, one!

530
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,870
CHARLYNE

531
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,530
<i>So this is it. Here's to the last day.</i>

532
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,960
(???)<i>8 years and 177 shows.</i>

533
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,100
<i>It's almost 5 million man-hours,</i>

534
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,970
<i>or if you prefer, 566.6 years.</i>

535
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,050
<i>4,074 miles of film.</i>

536
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,090
<i>Just 1 more mile to go.</i>

537
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,490
Rolling!

538
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,140
And action.

539
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,880
I think it's because all of me believes that Foreman is a sucker for an emotional plea.

540
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,070
Cut.

541
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,390
Good. All right, that's a wrap, guys!

542
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,770
Mr. Hugh Laurie!

543
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,160
Mr. Hugh Laurie.

544
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,850
<i>Morning, Hugh. 

545
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,780
And they're all being very polite to me,</i>

546
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,540
<i>because I've laid on a plane</i> <i>for our very last trip.</i>

547
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,220
<i>It was either that or nine hours in a van,</i>

548
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,040
<i>and I thought, well, if anybody's deserved it,</i> <i>they have.</i>

549
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,780
<i>That's the international sign</i> <i>of someone going up in a helicopter.</i>

550
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,460
So proud of myself I forget the next thing.
????

551
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,580
You tell 'em they're not losing their boyish good looks or becoming worn out. I, uh, okay.

552
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,760
Your husband continues to decline.

553
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm sorry.

554
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,550
Did you just give me the nod to do that?

555
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,860
I cannot abide that.

556
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,030
Oy, can I do that again? I'm so sorry.

557
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,390
*And we rest in this sleepless stall *

558
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,990
*until the morning shows light on it all *

559
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,540
All right, one more time, here we go.

560
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,810
Going again.

561
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,310
- You're so cute. - I'm sorry. Cut.

562
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,830
WARDROBE FITTING ROOM A

563
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,220
(COSTUMES)- We started in this room... - July 13...

564
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,010
(CATHY CRANDALL???)July 13, 2004. 2004.

565
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,820
- God sake. - Our very first fitting on the TV show "House. " 

566
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,750
I look just like my son. I know, right?

567
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,260
Well, you're not supposed to go for that so quickly, Cathy.

568
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,260
You're gonna ruin it. Our very first fitting.

569
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,420
And, uh, this is our very last fitting for "House. "

570
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,840
amy dodson
COSTUME SUPERVISOR

571
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,910
It says it all. Ira Hurvitz- I've called him out many times.

572
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,490
I've actually seen him asleep. I've actually caught him falling asleep.

573
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,980
I'm just gonna draw out three at random.

574
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,590
And everyone else can just lump it.

575
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,490
I'd like to thank the script supervisor Ira Hurvitz.

576
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,770
(IRA HURVITZ???)There are so many good people working on this show.

577
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,570
I have to watch the continuity to make sure,

578
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,350
since we're shooting out of order, we don't forget any details.

579
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,910
I mean, I can so heavily rely on the makeup and hair people.

580
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,860
I doubt it. You're welcome.

581
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,240
Um, where were you this morning when I woke up?

582
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,800
Here getting ready for the "House" big wrap party.

583
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,580
<i>Yes, indeed, this is a big wrap party.</i>

584
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,620
<i>Of course, we have a wrap party</i> <i>at the end of every season,</i>

585
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,500
<i>but this is the end of everything-eight years.</i>

586
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,690
<i>Almost 1,000 people have worked on this show.</i>

587
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,430
<i>There's a lot of stories to be told,</i>

588
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,550
<i>a lot of tears to be shed,</i>

589
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,490
<i>a lot of songs to be sung.</i>

590
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,200
*The night *

591
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,120
*and the Tennessee waltz *

592
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,130
<i>That, by the way, is not a prop Martini.</i>

593
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:06,690
*The Tennessee waltz *

COSTUMES

595
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,290
Good night.

596
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,770
Did you just take a pill? No.

597
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,440
(PRODUCTION)I have been watching it from the beginning.

598
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,610
I've heard from a lot of people, and I've had this experience myself

599
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,340
where we'll wear a "House" hat or a "House" T-shirt,

600
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,030
and people really do come up to us and say, "do you work on 'House'?"

601
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,930
It's nice. And Jamie takes advantage of that.

602
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,670
I'm not saying I take advantage of that. And she gets free stuff.

603
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,740
Please don't air that on national TV.

604
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,590
I just want to thank "House" for having me out and inspiring me 

605
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,920
in making one of the biggest decisions in my life,

606
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,130
that I want to continue to med school and be a doctor.

607
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,130
Rita from Battle Creek, Michigan,

608
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,300
wants to know why millions of people around the world...

609
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,170
Around the world.

610
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,210
Are invested in the character of Gregory house.

611
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,300
I think it's because of your blue eyes.

612
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,810
Right.

613
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,070
I think that's it. That's pretty much what I was saying,

614
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,520
but more condensed.

615
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,670
Dr. House, if you're gonna save this patient,

616
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,560
you'll need this.

617
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,730
RULE BOOK

618
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,780
Get this thing out of my sight!

619
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,650
Can you help me?

620
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,470
Well, let's see now.

621
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,320
The genitals seem healthy.

622
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,620
You are a woman, right?

623
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,910
I'm hosting the Emmys.

624
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,750
Oh. What a feather in your cap.

625
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,540
Mr. Laurie, I'm proud to present you the- with the Golden Camera Award.

626
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,940
All artists must travel a lot.

627
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,890
BUT NONE OF THEM TALK TO ME

628
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,920
BECAUSE I'M SUCH A COMPLETE

629
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,890
ASS ****

630
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,610
(CAROLINE, USA)It's made me think. It's made me laugh a lot.

631
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,770
It's made me cry.

632
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,800
(CLAUDIO , ITALY)Thank you, "House. " 

633
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,550
(REBECCA, USA)Thank you for eight great seasons.

634
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,380
(HARRY USA)Thank you. 

635
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,220
(ISABELLA BRAZIL)Thank you.

636
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,120
I know I am never, ever going to forget it.

637
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,190
HALF- WIT

638
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,830
<i>"I left Holmes seated in front of the smoldering fire.</i>

639
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,710
<i>"And long into the watches of the night</i> <i>"I heard the low,

640
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,260
 melancholy wailings of his violin</i> <i>"and knew that he was still pondering</i>

641
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,470
<i>over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel. "</i>

642
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,190
Call radiology. I want to see the music.

643
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,390
HOUSE OF HOLMES

644
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,040
Am I right in saying Conan Doyle based Sherlock Holmes on a doctor.

645
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,710
I don't want to say you based House on the doctor,???

646
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,360
but the similarities are... Yeah, a little- inspired.

647
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,410
There are parallels, and because of those parallels,

648
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,490
there was a wink of the eye,

649
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,520
but it was never intended to be a modern-day Holmes,

650
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,370
a doctor who fundamentally isn't interested in saving lives...

651
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,400
But is interested in the puzzle.

652
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,340
There's also the implication, though,

653
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,550
in the art of the puzzle,

654
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,670
that the person who thrives on puzzle-solving

655
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,720
must be less empathetic,

656
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,560
less, uh, emotional.

657
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,890
What were you doing up in Middletown?

658
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,490
You know what's more interesting than what I was doing

659
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,630
is the reason you are so obsessed

660
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,210
with what I was doing. 

661
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,120
House and Wilson, Holmes and Watson-

662
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,870
the names are a clear homage. Robert does carry

663
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,790
a sort of Watson-Ian solid citizen...

664
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,930
Yeah. Aura about him.

665
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,730
I love House and Wilson's relationship,

666
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,970
because there's a sense of mutual respect

667
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,110
and honestly

668
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,530
I always feel like
Hugh has a twinkle in his eye that you only see

669
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,330
when he's talking to- to Wilson.

670
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,370
HOUSE WITH LOVE

671
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,390
<i>Well, what would you do?</i> <i>You know the show's finished.</i>

672
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,400
<i>Never gonna use these sets again.</i>

673
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,480
<i>And at 9:00 tomorrow morning,</i>

674
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,840
<i>large men with chain saws are coming in.</i>

675
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,510
<i>Well, obviously, there's only one thing to do.</i>

676
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,650
GREGOR HOUSE M D

677
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,150
It was a fun night, though.

678
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,810
The strangest thing, isn't it?

679
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,670
Eight years that we have been walking-

680
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,730
Now that's very satisfying. Yeah.

681
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,460
What the... I did not know you had that capability.

682
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,650
I dare you to shoot your own foot. No, I'm not going to,

683
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,870
because I actually did this once, and it hurts.

684
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,260
I'm gonna shoot my own foot. Go ahead.

685
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,100
Oddly enough, that does sting-

686
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,180
that does sting a little bit.

687
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,530
Yeah, that'll- you'll feel that. Oh!

688
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,090
Yeah. I- I didn't want to warn you,

689
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,270
'cause, like, I enjoy-I knew I would enjoy you in pain.

690
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,780
So I didn't want to warn you too strongly,

691
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,120
but it does hurt. But the things I am prepared to do to entertain the general public.

692
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,610
 It really is pathetic.

693
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,300
Should we end this? Yeah, let's end it.

694
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,310
We just end it now.

695
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,340
*You've got to win a little *

696
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,020

*that's the glory of love... *

700
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,780
There obviously is no show without the fans,

701
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,850
and more fundamentally, there's no point to the show without the fans.

702
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,870
<i>This is the exact spot</i> <i>where I stood, sat,
