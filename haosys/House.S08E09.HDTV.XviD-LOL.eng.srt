1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,950
We're in the car, honey.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,170
We're going to the hospital for tests.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,770
We're in the hospital.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,740
We're going to the Doctor's office.

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,400
Can you tell me what this is called?

6
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,540
Uh, you use it to get food from inside.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,950
Yes, but what's it called?

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,470
Is it a spatula?

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,790
- No. <i>- Good.</i>

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,020
Is it a can opener?

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,370
Uh, no, it's, um...

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,690
It's, um...

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,450
You're trying to make me look stupid.

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,250
You can go to hell! Why don't you kill yourself?

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,630
Andres.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,760
It's okay.

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,000
There she is. Here I am.

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,590
Here, come on.

19
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,600
You just need to answer a few more questions.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,070
Then we're going home. We'll have lunch, okay?

21
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,650
Okay.

22
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,280
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,310
I have Alzheimer's.

24
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,590
I know.

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,230
The mood swings come on quickly, but, um...

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,320
It's under control.

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,010
Don't worry. He's actually perfect for the drug trial.

28
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,570
Thank God. We can start as soon as next week.

29
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,370
Andres... <i>Oh, my God!</i>

30
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,860
<i>Andres...</i>

34
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,190
<i>Early onset</i> <i>familial Alzheimer's.</i> <i>Brazilian descent.</i>

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,310
Blood chemistry showed high ammonia.

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,500
<i>Vomiting stopped after the E.R.</i> <i>put him on antiemetics.</i>

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,170
Any recent health issues?

38
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,770
Just a sore throat a few weeks ago.

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,770
<i>How advanced is he?</i> Could be hyperalimentation.

40
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,040
Advanced enough, but no IV feedings.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,430
The wife shut down a floral company to stay home and feed him

42
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,340
every meal he's had in the last four years.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,460
Do we owe this case to your guilt at having ignored your own forgetful mommy?

44
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,690
My guilt over my mom is why I put up with my dad.

45
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,190
You're taking this case because we're running a phase-two trial on an Alzheimer's drug.

46
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,940
You couldn't round up enough doddering old Guinea pigs.

47
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,300
You need us to fix this little piggy? I'd like to sit in.

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,180
Especially since you're short a team member.

49
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,880
You mean Taub? Got him in here.

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,220
He asked for a personal day. His daughter's sick.

51
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,350
Isn't that the point of having a spare?

52
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,060
I denied his request.

53
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,000
After I'd already approved it, which you knew because I sent you a memo.

54
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,560
Dr. Adams...

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,980
<i>Taped under your chair</i> is an index card.

56
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,950
Would you read it, please?

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,730
"Wednesday, 2:43 p.m.,

58
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,490
<i>"a black Pawn will believe</i> <i>he's the black King</i>

59
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,770
<i>"and attempt</i> <i>to capture the...</i>

60
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,440
white head of diagnostics."

61
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,530
- It's 10:15 on Friday. <i>- Damn it.</i>

62
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,170
Look, the point is I saw this coming.

63
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,130
Dr. Foreman and I did not always see eye-to-eye.

64
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,190
But he never had the power to overrule me.

65
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,660
Now that he has the power, he won't be able to resist the temptation to use it.

66
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,500
With great power comes great micromanaging.

67
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,270
And great vests.

68
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,700
I know you're the better diagnostician.

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm not gonna interfere. I'm only here to help.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,610
Could be transient nitrogen load from a G.I. bleed.

71
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,030
Not if the vomiting's persistent.

72
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,570
Which we won't know, because the E.R. put him on antiemetics.

73
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,450
Take him off.

74
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,870
Wait. He's puking his guts out. We'd risk aspiration.

75
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,780
I'm just disagreeing, not overruling.

76
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,680
So glad you're on board.

77
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,260
<i>Take him off antiemetics,</i>

78
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,070
do an upper endoscopy to check for bleeds.

79
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,930
It could be a bladder infection. We'll run a pregnancy test.

80
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,660
Oh, I'm not pregnant. Any type of birth control can fail.

81
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,060
Not mine.

82
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,400
Oh, I'm sorry. You said you were married.

83
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,650
Yeah, happily. That's okay.

84
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,410
Sex can wane in any marriage over time.

85
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,410
No, no. We've never had sex.

86
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,430
Oh, we kiss and cuddle,

87
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,560
but neither one of us is interested in sex.

88
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,470
You're...both celibate.

89
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,330
No, neither of us.

90
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,180
Celibacy is a choice. This is our orientation.

91
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,890
We're asexual.

92
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,950
Not quite sure what box to check here.

93
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,880
<i>You're making a mistake.</i> If I had the power to veto him,

94
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,130
given all the crap I've put up with over the years, don't know if I could use it objectively.

95
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,670
I do, I can, I have.

96
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,460
Might be easier if you'd stay out of the room.

97
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,300
I thought it'd be different. This week.

98
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,820
Supposed to talk to his P.O. about getting his ankle monitor off early.

99
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,770
You're saying he should defer to you?

100
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,640
No, I'm just saying what he's doing doesn't seem rational,

101
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,200
which makes me think it's rational in a way I'm not privy to.

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,190
He always has a plan. And he's always self-destructive.

103
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,520
He may just be shooting himself in the ankle.

104
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,280
I know it feels strange. Dr. Chase is just looking in your throat.

105
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,280
<i>We're in the hospital.</i> You're fine.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,590
That's a pretty nice trophy, there, Andres. <i>He coached youth soccer.</i>

107
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,150
Took a team that was 0-6 all the way to the state finals at Long Branch.

108
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,680
Hey, thanks for doing this in here. Switching rooms can be very disorienting.

109
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,490
You take very good care of him.

110
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,580
I love him. Sickness and health, right?

111
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,040
Upper esophagus is clear.

112
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,280
Moving on to the G.E. junction.

113
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,030
 I'm sorry.

114
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,970
Family members only during procedures. Uh, I'll-- I'll be outside.

115
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,550
Oh, no. Please, um, <i>it's okay.</i>

116
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,220
Joseph helps me with my husband sometimes.

117
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,830
He's a good friend.

118
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,330
Which means not family. <i>Wait, we're gonna</i> <i>be here a while.</i>

119
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,210
Why don't you show Joseph where the visitor's lounge is?

120
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,690
Okay.

121
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,050
What?

122
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,560
Surprised you didn't go into the diplomatic corps.

123
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,190
Oh, you think they're...

124
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,170
No, if they're having sex, it's probably with their genitals.

125
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,490
Mallory-Weiss tear. Vomiting must have torn the lining.

126
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,580
You know that close to 1% of the population

127
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,810
identifies as asexual?

128
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,100
We really gotta get you laid.

129
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,130
If I have to plough that furrow myself, so be it.

130
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,420
I have a patient who's asexual.

131
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,140
Is she a giant pool of algae? It's a valid sexual orientation.

132
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,390
According to this article, at least. Yeah, I think I read that too.

133
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,830
Is that <i>fugliness weekly?</i> She's perfectly fine-looking.

134
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,110
Happily married for ten years.

135
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,990
To a guy who loves penis enough for the both of them.

136
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,990
He's asexual too. Ran a complete physical on her.

137
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,970
Nothing wrong except a common bladder infection.

138
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,960
100 bucks says I can find a medical reason

139
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,390
why she doesn't want to have sex.

140
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,610
You're out of your mind if you think I'm letting you anywhere near my patient.

141
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,210
Fine. I won't go near her.

142
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,460
Just give me her file and any blood samples you have left over.

143
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,630
No contact, whatsoever.

144
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,120
You talk to her, the bet is void. No contact.

145
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,260
Plays to my strengths anyway.

146
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,060
Right now's not a good time, House. Not for the Dean of Medicine.

147
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,280
But it's a perfect time if you're a member of my team.

148
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,730
Which one are you?

149
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,520
What did the endoscopy show?

150
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,580
<i>No signs of ulcers</i> <i>or blockages.</i>

151
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,250
But you found a tear just below the esophagus.

152
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,230
Explains the bleeding. Doesn't explain why he vomited so hard he ripped his insides.

153
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,150
His liver enzymes are slightly elevated.

154
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,450
Gallstones could've-- no complaints of pain.

155
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,860
Steatohepatitis would make his AST and ATL levels rise.

156
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,690
Are you calling his liver fat?

157
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,980
Start the patient on statins, and do a biopsy to confirm.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,040
<i>And knock him out.</i> I've heard he's a wiggler.

159
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,910
There's no need to put him under.

160
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,440
We can confirm fatty liver with an ultrasound.

161
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,030
Just making an observation.

162
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,920
Well done. Now, as a member of my team,

163
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,080
you can make the equally-useful observations that the sky is blue, I'm wearing pants,

164
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,240
and I'm ignoring your first observation.

165
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,510
Of course.

166
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,780
Wait.

167
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,880
And there it is.

168
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,500
You're trying to screw with my confidence.

169
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,450
Well, if I wanted to do that, I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you.

170
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,020
You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate

171
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,470
to keep me from ever intervening, even if it's fully in the scope of my duties.

172
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,420
Like now.

173
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,680
<i>This isn't</i> <i>about diagnostics,</i> <i>it's about what's safe</i> <i>for the patient.</i>

174
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,650
Do the ultrasound.

175
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,360
Ultrasound it is. And the nurses love you.

176
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,970
You don't think I knew House was gonna tell you to ignore me and not do the ultrasound?

177
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,550
This is an ultrasound machine.

178
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,910
Which you're gonna use to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy.

179
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,030
<i>Probably got a kit</i> <i>stashed here...</i>

180
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,040
"Cuddy dark will waste his afternoon chasing conspiracy theories."

181
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,020
<i>You're letting him</i> <i>get inside your head.</i>

182
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,910
He could do a lot of damage in there.

183
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,100
Dr. Chase.

184
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,210
He started vomiting again.

185
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,910
This is why we stopped the antiemetics.

186
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,910
<i>We needed to see if</i> <i>it was still a symptom.</i>

187
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,240
Okay.

188
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,120
Here, you want this? Get your hands off me.

189
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,950
You're taking my head.

190
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,430
It's okay, Andres. You're in the hospital.

191
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,110
Here.

192
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,340
- 10 milligrams of Diazepam! - Already on it.

193
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,160
I'm fine. I'm fine.

194
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,340
I'm all right.

195
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,900
Foreman. Blood in his urine.

196
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,340
Resume the antiemetics, and increase the sedation.

197
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,710
He really went after her. Maybe he found out about her "good friend."

198
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,520
It was just paranoid rage, typical of Alzheimer's.

199
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,050
We don't even know if they were sleeping together. A few hours ago you were sure.

200
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,200
And that's significant why?

201
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,100
Sorry. Only the bleeding's medically relevant.

202
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,500
No, I wasn't being rhetorical. If they are sleeping together,

203
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,230
why do we disapprove?

204
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,940
You're pro-infidelity? She's not married.

205
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,590
If marriage is feeding and cleaning someone,

206
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,190
limiting conversations, to repeating a few simple commands,

207
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,180
then I was married to my pet rat.

208
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,650
And a lot of people owe me wedding gifts. And we're walking, we're walking.

209
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,240
I don't care how sick your spouse gets, you don't jump ship.

210
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,350
Alzheimer's is different.

211
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,060
She can't share her problems with him, or plan for the future.

212
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,270
The man she married no longer exists. Yes, he does. He's in there.

213
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,480
This is why you get married.

214
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,010
Said the divorced woman to the divorced man. I didn't jump ship.

215
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,460
My husband sank it when he cheated on me. Commitment's not conditional.

216
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,250
She is there for him in the only way that matters now.

217
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,920
She gave up her life to take care of him. Which proves she's an idiot.

218
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,950
If she had any sense, she'd have stuck him in a facility

219
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,710
and jumped on that strange--

220
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,360
Dr. Foreman. We were just looking for you.

221
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,320
I was right about the antiemetics.

222
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,830
If you kept him on them like I said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.

223
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,250
Yes, we're back to my supposed diabolical plan

224
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,440
to shake your confidence.

225
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,190
Let's see if this helps.

226
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,780
If you're speaking as a team member, then I'd say you're a moron.

227
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,210
Because taking him off the antiemetics gave us crucial diagnostic information.

228
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,700
If you're speaking as Dean of Medicine,
then I'd say you're a moron.

229
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,370
'Cause your micromanaging kept us from doing a biopsy.

230
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,540
If we had, the patient would have been anesthetized

231
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,660
hours ago, thus unable to go all Chris Brown on her ass.

232
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,140
Unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife,

233
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.

234
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,530
Dr. Park,

235
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,050
would you please reach under that chair?

236
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,050
"The patient will punch his wife."

237
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,290
<i>You clearly wrote that</i> <i>after the fact.</i>

238
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,210
Dr. Adams,

239
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,730
would you please reach into my pants?

240
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,870
"Dr. Blackenshmurtz

241
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,520
will accuse me of writing about the punch after the fact."

242
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,300
Now, look.

243
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,830
Here's a photograph of me holding a newspaper.

244
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,500
Dated last Tuesday.

245
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,480
Now, how could I have gotten my hands on that? You done?

246
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,020
Rhabdomyolysis fits the vomiting, pigmenturia, and renal failure.

247
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,800
No muscle symptoms, and urine had no myoglobin.

248
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,760
<i>TTP fits, though.</i>

249
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,450
Start him on plasmapheresis.

250
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,370
Unless...

251
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,660
Unless I need to say, "mother, may I?"

252
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,680
And mother is an abbreviation.

253
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,230
<i>Fresh plasma will replace</i> <i>the damaged red blood cells</i>

254
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,070
that are clogging his kidneys. That sounds hopeful.

255
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,860
How is that feeling?

256
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,540
I've never been hit in the eye before.

257
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,830
I feel kinda badass.

258
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,780
I think maybe you should go. I'm fine. Okay?

259
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,000
See you tomorrow. Okay.

260
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,030
We're not having an affair. It's none of my business.

261
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,660
I mean, not-- not really.

262
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,730
'Cause nothing's happened.

263
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,450
We've talked about it a lot, and...

264
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,950
It's just really hard doing this by myself.

265
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,850
When's the last time you had a full night's sleep?

266
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,300
I don't know. Three years.

267
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,540
You're not going to get any rest here.

268
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,310
People who are sick are not the only ones who need to be taken care of.

269
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,380
Why doesn't Chase have to be here?

270
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,190
You think he knows anything about women

271
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,980
who don't want to have sex? Hormone levels are normal.

272
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,320
This woman seems perfectly healthy.

273
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,290
What does it matter if she says she's asexual?

274
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,250
It's the fundamental drive of our species. Sex is healthy.

275
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,640
<i>Orgasms oxygenate</i> <i>the brain,</i> <i>lighting up over</i> <i>30 different areas</i>

276
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,570
and making us forget how boring Susie Cooper is.

277
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,120
That last one may not be universal.

278
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,830
How about damage to her spinal cord blocking the signals from her genitals?

279
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,530
Sex drive is in the brain.

280
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,560
<i>I suppose it could be</i> <i>psychological intimacy issues</i>

281
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,000
caused by childhood abuse.

282
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,900
She's been sharing a toilet with the same guy for the last ten years.

283
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,350
That's not the same. <i>Sex releases oxytocin.</i>

284
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,270
It's the neurochemical basis for bonding.

285
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,610
And that's why men always marry their right hands.

286
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,770
It's different for girls. <i>No it's not.</i>

287
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,060
I've tapped over 30 guys

288
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,640
and never wanted to see most of them again.

289
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,810
I live next to a Jewish frat.

290
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,420
We are veering wildly off track. Please continue.

291
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,610
This woman's life is probably better off without sex.

292
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,870
<i>Eliminates most</i> <i>of her insecurity,</i> she's immune to most advertising

293
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,130
and can have honest relationships with men.

294
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,100
Not a lot of them.

295
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,820
We've run every test and ruled out all the options.

296
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,390
You're gonna have to accept she just doesn't want sex.

297
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,760
Lots of people don't have sex.

298
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,870
The only people who don't want it are either sick, dead, or lying.

299
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,020
<i>So maybe she's lying.</i> You think she's had a boyfriend on the side?

300
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,300
<i>For ten years?</i>

301
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,230
Sticking around the whole time? Doesn't make sense.

302
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,020
What does...

303
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,420
30?

304
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,720
Everybody lies.

305
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,640
Higher or lower?

306
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,940
Followed your advice and took the night off.

307
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,510
Seems to have done you some good.

308
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,160
Where's my husband?

309
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,850
He's not in the hospital. So he just walked out?

310
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,650
<i>All of the shift nurses</i> had their hands full with a double code.

311
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,320
Perfectly reasonable explanation.

312
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,270
<i>Same thing happened to me.</i> <i>Couldn't find my keys for days.</i>

313
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,590
The police have been notified.

314
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,400
I have staff searching.

315
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,370
You told me it was okay to leave. I'm sorry.

316
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,020
He has Alzheimer's!

317
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,540
<i>It's freezing outside,</i> <i>and he's sick!</i>

318
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,760
I mean, you don't even know what it is yet, do you?

319
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,450
The plasmapheresis hasn't had time to work, but TTP is our most likely--

320
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,570
Okay, I'm just-- I have to go look for him.

321
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,630
<i>Hey, don't be an ass.</i> <i>Can't you see</i> <i>she's upset?</i>

322
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,340
No, she's guilty.

323
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,800
'Cause instead of being at her husband's side, she was under you.

324
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,690
Okay, that's--y-- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

325
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,890
He already said I was an ass.

326
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,460
Personally, I applaud your decision to step down off your cross and get on with your life,

327
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,210
but your misplaced guilt is shutting down your brain.

328
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,490
We need you to sit, focus, and answer our questions.

329
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,820
So, at 6:00 a.m., the patient wakes up,

330
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,800
and the first thing he sees...

331
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,120
In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's patients regress to old routines.

332
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,540
<i>So what would your husband do</i> <i>on a Saturday morning?</i>

333
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,210
Nothing. Be at home.

334
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,300
What about a year ago? Or five years? Ten?

335
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,620
I don't know, um, he...

336
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,270
He trained for a marathon once.

337
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,780
<i>Soccer practice.</i> <i>We took a cooking class.</i>

338
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,120
That soccer trophy you were telling me about. <i>It's gone.</i>

339
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,210
Where was practice?

340
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,850
It was close to here. On Chesterfield.

341
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,530
Okay, he comes, he thinks he's waiting for practice.

342
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,500
He'd want to get out of the wind.

343
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,250
What's somewhere he could see the kids arrive?

344
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,460
There.

345
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,330
Over here.

346
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,160
On three. One, two, three.

347
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,190
Nothing.

348
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,390
Not dead until he's warm and dead.

349
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,630
Get him to the ICU.

350
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,660
Start him on extracorporeal circulation.

351
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,960
That'll raise his temperature too quickly,

352
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,970
it'll cause acidosis.

353
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,850
We can deal with his metabolism crashing,

354
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,130
we can't reverse brain damage if we go too slowly.

355
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,420
Either way, we don't get his temperature above 95,

356
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,420
it's not going to matter.

357
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,290
Multiple warm lavage is safer.

358
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,760
Do what House says.

359
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,950
He has no heartbeat, and he's not breathing.

360
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,430
How can he not be dead?

361
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,240
The body slows down when it cools,

362
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,990
but it doesn't fully stop.

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,800
We're warming his blood outside of his body,

364
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,990
then putting it back.

365
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,130
It'll raise his temperature enough

366
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,810
that his heart should naturally start.

367
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,670
Then we can shock it back into rhythm.

368
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,720
And if it doesn't start?

369
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,430
Then there's nothing we can do.

370
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,710
You think it's possible he knew what he was doing?

371
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,220
Like some part of him gets what he's putting his wife through,

372
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,760
so he tried to-- kill himself? It's what I'd do if I were him.

373
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,780
At least I wish I would.

374
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,410
I meant run away.

375
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,990
You think you should kill yourself if you become a burden to the people who love you?

376
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,760
If you really love them back, then...

377
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,530
Yes.

378
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,270
That's really dark.

379
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,570
It's not naive.

380
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,430
I just believe people are capable of more than you do, apparently.

381
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,700
We've got brain activity.

382
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,910
Temp's at 93.

383
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,040
His heart should start soon.

384
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,680
My dad left me alone

385
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,710
to care for my alcoholic mom and raise my baby sister.

386
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,890
<i>I was just a teenager.</i> I spent half my time changing diapers

387
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,360
and the other half cleaning up my mom's vomit.

388
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,730
But it must've been important that you stayed for both of them.

389
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,430
Mom died after a few years.

390
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,380
It was ugly and painful, and she went with me hating her.

391
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,110
My sister ended up drinking half of her life away

392
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,440
and hating me because I couldn't help.

393
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,680
After mom, I had nothing left.

394
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,900
So do I wish mom had used a gun instead of a bottle?

395
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,780
Yes.

396
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,600
I--I didn't know.

397
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,530
That's why I told you.

398
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,320
Ventricular fibrillation.

399
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,710
300 milligrams amiodarone.

400
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,720
Careful.

401
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,590
Once we establish rhythm,

402
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,960
any accidental movement could crash him back into V-fib.

403
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,070
Clear.

404
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,520
We still have a long way to go.

405
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,340
<i>Cold can be protective</i> <i>to the brain,</i>

406
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,370
but there is a possibility of damage.

407
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,700
We also need to confirm and treat whatever's making him sick.

408
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,030
I just gotta do a standard battery of tests.

409
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,150
<i>Blood, urine, eeg...</i>

410
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,130
Is that really necessary for a free flu shot?

411
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,920
Excuse me.

412
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,410
I have to deal with someone who's having a panic attack.

413
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,790
I specifically said the bet was off if you contacted the patient.

414
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,020
Exactly.

415
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,380
Never said anything about the patient's husband.

416
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,220
The deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.

417
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,480
I admit I was stuck,

418
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,200
until I realized the medical issue was not hers but his.

419
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,640
She's lying to compensate. It's a tale as old as time.

420
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,890
Boy meets girl, girl falls for boy,

421
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,230
boy says, "I'm asexual." Girl says, "yeah, me too."

422
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,230
Your twisted logic can't hide the fact

423
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,530
that tricking a patient into being tested is completely unethical.

424
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,160
Come on.

425
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,350
Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter?

426
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,250
You love all that caring crap.
You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.

427
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,870
You're not even doing this out of medical curiosity.

428
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,270
I thought I made it clear I'm doing it for the cash.

429
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,530
Two people are happy, and your natural impulse is to destroy it.

430
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,680
How do you know she's happy? Did she tell you?

431
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,100
No, chirping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner.

432
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,730
All right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness,

433
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,290
but yours is to be a sucker for them.

434
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,270
You tell me which one's worse.

435
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,150
He just opened his eyes a little while ago.

436
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,770
His heartbeat's doing well,

437
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,450
and his body temperature is stabilized.

438
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,710
There he is.

439
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,750
<i>Me sinto quente.</i>

440
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,290
Is that Portuguese?

441
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,310
Yeah.

442
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,910
Honey, I don't understand.

443
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,930
<i>Me sinto quente.</i>

444
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,770
What's he saying?

445
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,030
I don't know.

446
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,430
I tried to learn when we got married, but I just--

447
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,420
it's okay. It's okay.

448
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,440
<i>His body temperature</i> <i>is rising.</i>

449
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,630
It's above normal. Wait, I thought--

450
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,970
I thought you said it was stable.

451
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,740
Why is it still rising? I don't know.

452
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,770
Vomiting, liver, kidneys, and now fever.

453
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,630
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, Dr. Foreman,

454
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,670
since telling people how to do their job is your job, but when your

455
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,410
less-than-competent administration of this hospital affects what's written on my whiteboard...

456
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,540
Get to the point. The word "fever."

457
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,780
Could come from the patient's illness, or it could come from the fact that you allowed him

458
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,090
to saunter out of your hospital and take a nap in the snow.

459
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,420
Couldn't have caught a virus while he was outside. Fever came on too fast.

460
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,400
The hypothermia could've caused cell necrosis.

461
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,670
TTP was the diagnosis when he walked out.

462
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,140
Fever's a little high, but it still fits.

463
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,750
We should continue plasmapheresis.

464
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,470
We're missing symptoms. We should add language loss and aggression.

465
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,210
<i>Should we also</i> <i>add forgetfulness?</i>

466
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,100
- He's got Alzheimer's. - We've just been assuming.

467
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,830
Because the patient's wife said he exhibited both for a year.

468
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,920
He's never hit her before or lost all his English.

469
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,870
We have to consider any change since he's been admitted as relevant.

470
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,480
Have to?

471
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,540
Do I need to pull out another card?

472
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,680
Disseminated viral infection with encephalitis.

473
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,430
<i>Patient complained of</i> <i>a sore throat a few weeks ago.</i>

474
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,220
Start him on Interferon.

475
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,520
<i>Encephalitis makes</i> <i>his brain swell,</i>

476
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,050
which causes symptoms that are
hard to distinguish from his Alzheimer's.

477
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,940
With the Interferon his English should come back,

478
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,240
and the aggression should subside. But you're not sure.

479
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,020
Unfortunately, no.

480
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:07,380
And you're not sure if he has brain damage from being frozen.

481
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,950
So best-case scenario,

482
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,070
I've just had a glimpse into his future?

483
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,620
I can't take care of him anymore.

484
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,920
<i>Chances are his mental state</i> <i>will improve.</i>

485
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,420
You could get more time with him.

486
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,610
We married six months after I met him.

487
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,040
A year after that, he started forgetting things.

488
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,130
I've known my husband longer with his Alzheimer's
than without.

489
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,720
I've watched more of him disappear

490
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,000
than I ever got to know.

491
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,560
I just can't do this anymore.

492
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,590
You lose.

493
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,140
Blood work shows high levels of prolactin.

494
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,300
Add that to some peripheral red-green confusion,

495
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,920
puts my money-- excuse me, your money--

496
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,440
soon to be my money

497
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,450
<i>on a tumor</i> <i>near his pituitary.</i>

498
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,550
Probably started growing in his early teens.

499
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,360
Lowering his libido

500
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,070
and causing erectile dysfunction.

501
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,860
<i>A year on</i> <i>dopamine agonists,</i> and he'll be a sex-crazed creep just like the rest of us,

502
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,850
completely fascinated by Susie Cooper.

503
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,460
I'd prefer to be paid in a single $100 bill.

504
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,280
Always wanted to use one to light a cigar.

505
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,720
Hooray for us. We disproved his asexuality.

506
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,110
We also probably ruined his life. <i>He'll thank us.</i>

507
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,300
Then he'll doze off,

508
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,760
and then in a couple hours, he'll thank us again.

509
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,010
It could destroy his identity.

510
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,710
It's like a gay person being told they're really straight.

511
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,680
So don't tell him.

512
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,750
Yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head?

513
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,060
He'll notice it eventually, when it starts leaking out his ears.

514
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,780
<i>It's a slow-growing tumor.</i>

515
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,320
He'll probably die of boredom long before that. You always do this.

516
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,230
You--you meddle

517
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,620
and force me into impossible situations.

518
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,100
You knew the second you told me about this case

519
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,270
that I'd get involved.

520
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,070
You wanted me to meddle.

521
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,080
Because no matter how much you wanted to believe in this chaste romance,

522
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,980
you didn't buy it either.

523
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,870
Where's that petition House's P.O. sent over about getting his ankle monitor off?

524
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,480
On your desk.

525
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,990
You played me.

526
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,930
This whole thing was about your ankle monitor.

527
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,940
You weren't trying to undermine my confidence,

528
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,160
you were trying to inflate it.

529
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,520
You manufactured conflict with me so eventually you could let me win.

530
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,910
You knew it was encephalitis, but you waited for me to say it

531
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,180
because then with my ego boosted, you thought I'd be in the mood to take off your monitor

532
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,100
because I'd think I could control you.

533
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,110
You're right. Take off my monitor.

534
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,430
See, the beauty of the plan

535
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,160
is that if it works, you think you can control me.

536
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,820
If it fails, then you will actually have proven

537
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,890
that you can control me.
It's pretty genius.

538
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,340
These are your training wheels.

539
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,940
If you think you're up to this job, it's time to lose them.

540
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,660
Second half of my plan might need work.

541
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,160
V-fib. Two rounds of 360 without establishing a rhythm.

542
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,470
Wait, Dr. Foreman!

543
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,580
Clear.

544
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,080
He's back.

545
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,200
I sure hope this Alzheimer's drug trial is worth a lot to this hospital,

546
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,950
'cause we're wasting a crap-load of time and manpower
just to let this guy watch his mind shrivel

547
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,220
and keep his wife miserable.

548
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,040
Heart attack while he was on Interferon rules out encephalitis,

549
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,370
but I still think I'm right about the neural symptoms.

550
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,430
It's probably aseptic meningitis. Would have seen meningial signs.

551
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,670
Given his abnormal mental status, not necessarily.

552
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:43,250
<i>Dr. Foreman,</i> would you please reach under your chair?

553
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,370
There's just wet gum under here. Where's the card?

554
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,900
What card?

555
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,350
I'm happy to leave if you have <i>a better theory</i> <i>than aseptic meningitis.</i>

556
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,020
Toxins. This guy went on walkabout.

557
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,830
<i>Chances are</i> <i>he's done it before.</i> Wife keeps the doors on the house locked.

558
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,820
Plenty of nasty stuff to get into during the middle of the night.

559
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,310
We asked about toxins on the history.

560
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,890
The wife said she was sure to clear the house for her husband's safety.

561
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,180
I'm sure she succeeded.

562
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,030
She's a PhD in toxicology, right?

563
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,310
She's an ex-florist. Search the home for toxic plants,

564
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,300
methyl bromide, any medications.

565
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,540
Stop.

566
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,920
You're not infallible. You were wrong about encephalitis.

567
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,039
Just before you were. Run CSF tests.

568
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,360
<i>Find out what's</i> <i>causing the meningitis.</i>

569
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,140
You said you weren't gonna overrule me diagnostically.

570
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,470
And you said I wouldn't be able to help it.

571
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,070
Apparently, you were right about that one.

572
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,050
<i>Fine.</i> I'll look for toxins myself.

573
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,030
You can't go to their house without Foreman's permission.

574
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,020
Don't need it. I'll talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs.

575
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,310
<i>What about gifts</i> <i>from South America?</i>

576
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,350
Anyone send any fruits or vegetables?

577
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,500
I don't think so, no.

578
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,760
<i>Barraco azul...</i>

579
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,150
I'm gonna need your boyfriend <i>to collect samples</i> <i>of plants</i>

580
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,690
in and around your house. Toxins are the most...

581
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,760
<i>Barraco azul...</i>

582
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,790
<i>O que e isso?</i> <i>Barraco azul?</i>

583
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,280
Wait, you understand him?

584
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,430
What's he saying?

585
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,140
He's--he's repeating, "blue shack."

586
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,460
You know what that is?

587
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,530
Is it somewhere where pesticides may be kept?

588
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,360
It's where we had our first date.

589
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,250
Do you have a cleaning lady who might bring her own supplies?

590
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,000
What's he saying?

591
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,060
If it's not relevant to the case, I don't care.

592
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,170
And neither should you. Please.

593
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,140
This might be the last time I ever know what he's thinking.

594
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,900
When I saw her waiting...

595
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,590
Waiting for me at the table...

596
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,510
The way her eyes looked when she smiled...

597
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,120
I felt like crying.

598
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,660
I knew that she was the woman I wanted to marry.

599
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,190
Every time I see her, I say...

600
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,650
<i>La esta ela.</i>

601
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,810
There she is. There she is.

602
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,520
He's still in there.

603
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,380
<i>Quem e ela?</i>

604
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,260
What did he say?

605
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,150
He asked who you were.

606
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,640
Don't get your hopes up.

607
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,200
Have your boyfriend give me those samples.

608
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,270
How'd you even know to look for a tumor?

609
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,180
Well, Dr. House noticed hormone levels in your blood,

610
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,000
and consulted me as an oncologist.

611
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,470
Who cares how they found it, okay? They found it.

612
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,540
Are there any side effects to the treatment?

613
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,910
Some nausea, dizziness, and as the tumor shrinks,

614
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,740
there will be behavioral changes. Like what?

615
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,120
Well...

616
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,300
The tumor interferes with certain natural systems.

617
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,880
It lowers libido and causes erectile dysfunction.

618
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,700
Y-you mean the treatment will,

619
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,900
M-make me want to have sex?

620
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,890
Wh-what if I don't want the treatment? I would strongly advise...

621
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,470
You have a brain tumor, okay? You have to have the treatment.

622
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,370
Okay, look, I know who I am, okay? And I'm not one of them.

623
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,940
Hey, look, we'll adjust. Okay?

624
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,120
We can go through this together.

625
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,800
You mean have sex? I can't make you do that.

626
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,920
Maybe it won't be so bad.

627
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,650
It'll be terrible.

628
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,090
It's actually pretty fun.

629
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,500
From what I remember.

630
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,670
But you said that... I know.

631
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,950
I know. I wanted to spend my life with you.

632
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,820
And I knew that meant making certain sacrifices.

633
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,510
But a girl has needs.

634
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,750
You dropped in the U.S. News rankings.

635
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,800
With respect, Mr. Laffont,

636
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,910
that's only because we temporarily shut down our Diagnostics Department.

637
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,020
It's up and running again.

638
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,950
I'm actually concerned it might be because of the change in management.

639
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,540
<i>If you want my money,</i> <i>I'll need</i> <i>to see a five-year plan.</i>

640
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,580
Am I boring you?

641
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,750
No, no, I just...

642
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,380
Those flowers are from last week. They should be dead by now.

643
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,280
Excuse me?

644
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,630
Sorry. I have to go.

645
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,300
It's Reye's syndrome.

646
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,160
Patient had a sore throat a few weeks ago before he was admitted.

647
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,670
Reye's in adults is a reach. Not if he took aspirin.

648
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,840
Aspirin in adults is a reach.

649
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,650
Especially in a house with locked medicine cabinets. Wasn't in the medicine cabinet.

650
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,390
Wife used to run a floral company. Still does a few orders from home.

651
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,230
She uses crushed aspirin in the water

652
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,500
to make the flowers last longer.

653
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,920
So the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing,

654
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,200
realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat...

655
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,970
Stop me whenever you like.

656
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,400
Have Chase start him on steroids.

657
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,080
Already did. Then why're you telling me?

658
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,360
'Cause I wanted you to hear it from me.

659
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,160
There she is.

660
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,010
Here I am.

661
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,910
Your eye.

662
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,850
What happened?

663
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,250
It's nothing I can't handle.

664
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,420
MRI confirmed macroprolactinoma.

665
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,500
He's doing the treatment. And the wife?

666
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,250
Come on.

667
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,420
<i>You saved a man's life.</i>

668
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:37,790
Course-corrected two peoples' wildly screwed-up world views.

669
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,990
It's not bad for a day's work.

670
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,080
I think they were happy.

671
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,260
<i>Even if it was</i> <i>based on lies.</i> Most happiness is.

672
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,980
Better to have schtupped and lost then never to have schtupped at all.

673
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,720
We can't smoke in here.

674
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,280
We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet.

675
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,700
And yet it happens. It's an imperfect world.

676
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,580
Well?

677
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,620
Disgustingly satisfying.

678
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,300
He said it was okay. Is one of you Dr. House?

679
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,340
You've seen <i>Spartacus,</i> right?

680
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,950
<i>I got an order here</i> to deactivate and remove his ankle monitor.

681
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,530
<i>Robbie?</i>

682
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,100
Hi, sis.

683
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,290
* Gentle is the sun

684
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,700
<i>It's been years.</i>

685
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,150
I know.

686
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,650
I thought of you on mom's birthday.

687
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,510
* I breathe it in my soul

688
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,430
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

689
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,140
Yeah, yeah. Fine. I just...

690
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,880
* And I want to let you know *

691
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,770
wanted to see how you were.

692
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,940
<i>I'm fine.</i>

693
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,530
* And come down

694
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,030
* come down

695
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,720
* innocent way of life

696
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,550
Bikes go faster without training wheels.

697
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,380
* Easily we cry

698
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,100
Now get out. I have work to do.

699
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,140
* Weaving through the cracks *

700
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:54,340
* we are simply human

701
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,700
* You know we are

702
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,050
