<i>Pressure. I need pressure.</i> <i>Get me sutures on a Kelly.</i>

2
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:21,079
<i>Need an EPI.</i>

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,321
<i>- Get O.R. Ten unpacked.</i>  <i>- Alert trauma.</i>

7
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:18,662
Let the record show that we are officially convening

8
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:21,064
a disciplinary hearing regarding the events

9
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:24,880
of February 3, 2012 in patient room 209.

10
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:28,299
Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published along with

11
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,435
all supporting documentation and rulings.

12
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,529
Do you have any questions before we get started?
Yeah.

13
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,383
Who the hell are you?

14
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:44,064
I'm Walter Cofield, Chief of Neurology, Mercy Hospital.

15
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:46,045
I'll be deciding your fate today.

16
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,080
Cofield.

17
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:01,581
You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy,

18
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:04,030
<i>which means it's safe</i> <i>to assume</i> <i>that you trained Foreman.</i>

19
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:07,740
Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.

20
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:11,831
I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.

21
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:15,387
<i>It's interesting</i> that he'd pick the old mentor to judge the new one.

22
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:17,847
Interesting, but not relevant.

23
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:21,317
The facts of this case, on the other hand-- the facts are in the file.

24
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,507
If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call.

25
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:27,157
I'm going back to work.

26
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,778
If I just consider the file, <i>the facts</i> <i>aren't in your favor.</i>

27
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:36,834
The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand,

28
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:39,077
would mean a revocation of your parole.

29
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,665
The patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher.

30
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,036
He collapsed while out jogging.

31
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:07,161
He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans...

32
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:10,598
Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.

33
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:12,179
Put out an APB for a car

34
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,600
with a man-shaped dent in the grill?

35
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:18,803
No broken bones, no signs of trauma. Transverse myelitis.

36
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:22,424
Boring.
No enhancement on the MRI.

37
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:23,632
I just don't know what to do.

38
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:26,711
Please, you have to help me solve this thing.

39
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,576
A little poetic license.

40
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:41,988
What are you doing? Taking my vic-amins.

41
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,400
<i>Those are Vicodin?</i>

42
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,937
Did you have surgery recently? About a decade ago.

43
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:49,137
My leg is no good at judging time.

44
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:51,388
Were you taking Vicodin during this case?

45
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,740
Yes.

46
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:01,440
And during about nine years of previous cases.

47
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,484
My process is proven.

48
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,539
Good things usually happen.

49
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,937
Bad things sometimes happen.

50
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,949
And when bad things happen,

51
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,956
we should figure out what went wrong, so we can learn from it and correct it.

52
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,617
<i>So that we can</i> <i>assign blame</i> <i>instead of recognizing</i>

53
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:23,117
that bad things sometimes happen.

54
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,694
It was nobody's fault.

55
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:32,781
And then what happened?

56
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:38,881
Those who can, do.
Those who can't, teach.

57
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:41,701
Those who can't teach, teach gym.

58
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:46,013
Those who can't move their arms or legs <i>teach us to laugh</i> <i>at others.</i>

59
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:47,708
House actually presented the case in that way,

60
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,654
or are you just trying to make him look bad?

61
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:53,977
Why would I be trying to make him look bad?

62
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:57,567
Could be your not-so-subtle way of implying this was House's fault.

63
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,863
Given what's happened, it's understandable that your opinion would color your testimony,

64
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:03,969
but I just want to know what you said, what you did,

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,828
and what you were thinking at the time.

66
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,969
I don't think it was his fault.

67
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:17,662
Just tell me your initial theory. I thought the patient had a liver problem.

68
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:22,263
Hepatic encephalopathy explained why he passed out, why he couldn't move his limbs.

69
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,390
But that's not the idea House went with.

70
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,012
He thought Taub's idea was stupid.

71
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:31,308
<i>And what about your idea?</i> He thought that was stupid too.

72
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:34,342
No, I meant, what was it?

73
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:38,292
Oh. I thought the patient had normal pressure hydrocephalus.

74
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:40,473
And why did House think that was stupid?

75
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,493
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

76
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:45,765
<i>Unless you're an idiot,</i> <i>you know why I thought</i> <i>Park was an idiot.</i>

77
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,480
The patient had low opening pressure on his LP.

78
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:53,542
That's what I said. No, you idiot.

79
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:56,416
The patient had low opening pressure on his LP.

80
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,665
Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time.

81
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,001
Are you intentionally trying to get me to dislike you?

82
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:04,071
That wasn't me. The chair squeaked.

83
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,625
<i>You're testifying,</i> <i>for the record,</i>

84
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,995
that you actually used the phrasing "unsquint your eyes"?

85
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:11,005
It's not the place to exorcise your guilt.

86
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:13,778
I actually used the phrasing

87
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,510
"unsquint your eyes".

88
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,374
He's hypokalemic.

89
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,186
Could indicate a problem with his heart, which would-- - EKG was normal.

90
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:29,258
But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point.

91
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,759
The guy's potassium is off.

92
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,533
<i>Could be thyrotoxic paralysis.</i> <i>Start him on...</i>

93
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:36,093
Steroids, PTU, and beta blockers.

94
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:43,721
And how did these orange smudges get on the patient files?

95
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:45,889
Seriously?

96
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,394
That's your follow-up?

97
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:52,086
I eat a lot of cheetos, I forget to wash my hands.

98
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:54,502
Is my snacking really relevant to this case?

99
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:58,596
Might be, if these were actually cheetos' stains.

100
00:06:58,597 --> 00:06:59,865
What are they?

101
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:11,488
Seriously, House? You're blaming me?

102
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:13,571
You used Adams' shampoo.

103
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:16,457
I didn't do it.

104
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:21,095
It was a harmless prank.

105
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:24,107
My team is made up of Type-A personalities.

106
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:27,050
They need something to break the tension every once in a while.

107
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,418
So this was a team-building exercise?

108
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,083
Is that what he called it? That's what he implied.

109
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,895
House prefers chaos over cohesion.

110
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:39,248
He believes that disagreement and mistrust lead to better ideas.

111
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:43,289
He's not wrong. As opposed to being right?

112
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:47,556
So you treated with steroids.

113
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:49,901
- And then what happened? - They worked.

114
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,008
Our patient woke up.

115
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,781
Bill? Can you hear me?

116
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:55,949
Yeah.

117
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:59,217
I'm thirsty. That's normal.

118
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:02,571
You've been in a coma for several hours. Can you tell me your name?

119
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,268
Uh, Bill.

120
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:07,817
Bill Koppelman.
Can you tell me what happened to me?

121
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:09,285
<i>We're treating you</i> <i>for an overactive thyroid.</i>

122
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:13,310
We think that's why you passed out and couldn't move. Can you wiggle your fingers for me?

123
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:19,012
Is he going to be okay? Excuse me, but only family members are allowed.

124
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:23,396
It's okay. <i>They're my students.</i>

125
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:28,851
Everyone back at school is so worried about you. Is he sick because of the explosion?

126
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:33,475
What explosion? What explosion?
What explosion?

127
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:36,392
A chemistry demonstration he was doing for his class went wrong.

128
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:38,033
Why was it not already in the patient history?

129
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,284
Because the patient was unconscious.

130
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:46,170
But I'm assuming Dr. House spoke to the wife. The wife didn't know about the explosion.

131
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:49,253
And I was the one who questioned her, so, if there was an oversight,

132
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:50,885
it was mine.

133
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,605
Does Dr. House not attach importance to patient histories?

134
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,491
No, he thinks they're crucial.

135
00:08:57,492 --> 00:09:01,479
He just doesn't think being in the same room
as the patient is crucial.

136
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:08,123
House thinks avoiding patients allows him to stay as objective as possible.

137
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:11,782
He's not wrong.

138
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,932
Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.

139
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,526
That's also true. Either way, I'm covered.

140
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:22,743
If you want an accurate patient history, don't ever talk to the patient.

141
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,454
Everybody lies.

142
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,042
Except me. To you.

143
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:31,898
Would never do that. Okay. Say you're right.

144
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,572
If you had actually been in the room,

145
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:38,595
questioning the patient, you could read body language,

146
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:40,845
you could ask follow-up questions,

147
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,343
warn him of the costs of lying to you.

148
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:46,464
Don't forget the thumbscrews.

149
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:49,772
Can you dispute the possibility that,

150
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:53,400
had you visited the patient sooner, maybe talked to the wife,

151
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,812
been directed to one of the students,

152
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:57,323
that this case might have ended very differently?

153
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,222
It wasn't exactly an explosion.

154
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:07,495
It was a controlled reaction that went a little haywire.

155
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:09,590
It was too an explosion.

156
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:13,297
Simon Harris filmed the whole thing on his camera phone and posted it on YouTube.

157
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:18,610
It got, like, over 75,000 hits already. Looks like you've gone viral, Hon.

158
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,452
He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis...

159
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:29,843
But when I was told the patient coughed up blood,

160
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:33,013
then things really started to get interesting.

161
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:39,325
Your patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood,

162
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:43,735
and you found that interesting? Why, is that bad?

163
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,544
It's interesting.

164
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,663
I do this demonstration every year.

165
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:58,269
<i>I usually have a student aide</i> <i>help me set it up,</i>

166
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,305
<i>and apparently this year he</i> <i>added extra hydrofluoric acid,</i>

167
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:03,556
which is why it exploded.

168
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:08,096
The student aide was just trying to make a viral video, not hurt anyone.

169
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:09,795
Ended up doing both.

170
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,074
So we figured the patient inhaled the extra large dose of hydrofluoric acid and...

171
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,475
Burned his lungs, which is why he coughed up blood.

172
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,359
If only burnt lungs explained the passing out and paralysis.

173
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,137
The explosion does. Check out the video again. He smacked his head against the wall.

174
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:25,389
If that caused swelling in his brainstem,

175
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,081
that would have led to eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.

176
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:31,719
So we discussed it a little longer,

177
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,752
and House decided to treat with Heparin.

178
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:40,682
I wouldn't mind a couple more details.

179
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:44,061
It was aerosolized Heparin.

180
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:46,659
You skipped over the actual DDX,

181
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,624
and now you're averting your eyes.

182
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,322
I'm growing more and more curious by the moment.

183
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,958
He smacked his head against the wall.

184
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,260
If that caused swelling in his brainstem,

185
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,720
that would have led to eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.

186
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:05,795
- <i>Nobody move.</i>  - Aagh!

187
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:09,262
He--he had on a what? Gas mask.

188
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,908
The stink bomb was Chase's.

189
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:19,837
He was getting revenge for the orange hair

190
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:23,063
and rigged it in House's office.

191
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:25,616
But House found it.

192
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,567
You can leave when I have an answer. It might help if we knew the question.

193
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:38,714
How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?

194
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:42,641
Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar lavage <i>to wash 'em out</i> <i>with water.</i>

195
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:45,096
Sorry. My fault. Should have clarified.

196
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,877
How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the patient?

197
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:51,971
Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.

198
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,891
Burn cream would drown him faster than water.

199
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,099
Well?

200
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,367
Aerosolized Heparin.

201
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:01,879
Me likey.

202
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,307
<i>But that's only experimental.</i> It's never actually been used before.

203
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,343
Not true. Been used in sheep.

204
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,232
The guy was going downhill fast. We needed a treatment that was a...

205
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:20,983
Slope changer. So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?

206
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:24,902
It was a team-building exercise. No. It was manipulation.

207
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:29,023
You were pressuring your team into coming up with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.

208
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:32,041
You say pressure, I say inspire.

209
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:37,309
The usual safe ideas were not gonna work. Aerosolized Heparin might.

210
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,778
And everyone else just went along with this? No.

211
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,659
I told House I thought it was a mistake.

212
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,068
And those were your exact words?

213
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:49,710
I think I might have said insane.

214
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:52,208
You thought it was insane, and yet you let it happen.

215
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,513
No, I-- if you disagree with Dr. House on patient safety, Doctor, it is your duty to speak up.

216
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:57,897
Otherwise, you are equally to blame.

217
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,717
I did speak up. I tried. And you failed.

218
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:05,946
And that's why I went to Dr. Foreman.

219
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,592
The Heparin could cause the patient to bleed into his lungs even faster.

220
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,703
It is crazy, but House doesn't do crazy just for crazy's sake.

221
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:20,515
If he thinks this is the only way to help your patient...

222
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,974
<i>You did not tell me</i> <i>you were involved in this case</i> when you asked me to do this.

223
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,365
I wasn't.

224
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:35,969
The Heparin decision didn't have anything to do with the outcome.

225
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:41,085
If signing off on everything House does is a pattern, it affects the way House behaves,

226
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:44,610
it affects the way House's team reacts to the way House behaves.

227
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:46,072
House...

228
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,360
is brilliant.

229
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:53,081
I give him the benefit of the doubt most of the time

230
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:55,689
because I've seen what he can do. Getting House out of prison

231
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,270
is the biggest decision you've made as Dean of Medicine, right?

232
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:02,332
And if he's suspended as a result of this hearing,

233
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,848
he violates his parole and he goes back.

234
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:10,430
And that probably leaves you as former Dean of Medicine.

235
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,881
I suppose so.

236
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,584
You didn't choose me to oversee this because you thought I could be objective.

237
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,455
You chose me because you thought I'd have your back

238
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,469
and I'd think twice about making a decision

239
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,151
that would get you fired.

240
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,900
Eric. I'm sorry.

241
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,719
But if your get-House-out-of-jail-free

242
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,393
experiment blows up in your face,

243
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,255
it's not my job to get you out of it.

244
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:49,180
After you'd administered the Heparin,

245
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,565
I see there was a discharge order on the chart, and yet the patient never left.

246
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:58,835
House ordered a therapeutic bath first to wash off any residual chemicals from the blast.

247
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,385
But we wound up finding something.

248
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:04,964
You have a bit of a rash. Can you raise both your arms?

249
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,482
I just need to see how far it goes.

250
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:12,197
<i>You told me</i> <i>i was going to be okay.</i>

251
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:15,123
And now there's still something wrong with me.

252
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:18,859
It probably doesn't mean anything, but we want to make sure.

253
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:21,621
Of course you do.

254
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:24,582
I got to get out of here, okay?
Just relax.

255
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,348
Please just let me get out of here.

256
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:29,190
It'll just take a minute. We just need to get a good look at the rash.

257
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:31,205
The rash? That was nothing.

258
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:34,652
Just some irritation from lying in bed all day.

259
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,546
The problem was the patient's brain.

260
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:41,487
He freaked out. I got to--I got to get out.

261
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:45,209
I got to get out of here. "Freak out" is a little strong.

262
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,573
In my opinion at the time, it was the rash that was gonna kill him.

263
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:52,754
Invasive strep.
Reasonable theory, supported by the evidence.

264
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:55,636
The evidence pointed to psychosis.

265
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:58,931
We caused it by giving him steroids when he first came in.

266
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:00,548
What'd you think?

267
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:04,763
I thought Park and Adams were both right but that their conclusions were both wrong.

268
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:09,516
The neuro symptoms and the rash were both signs of an underlying disease.

269
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:12,951
Together with the lung, it added up to Wegener's.

270
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:19,076
How does Dr. House handle it when three smart doctors

271
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:21,726
come up with three different but equally valid ideas?

272
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:24,169
I run a diagnostic trial.

273
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,129
Start the patient on high-dose steroids.

274
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,474
<i>Multiple birds,</i> <i>single stone.</i>

275
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:38,370
<i>If Taub is right, then he</i> <i>will walk out of here cured.</i>

276
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:41,856
<i>If Adams is right,</i> <i>he'll spike a fever,</i> get hypotensive, we can treat it.

277
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:44,118
He can walk out of here cured.

278
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:47,121
If Park is right, he goes all <i>Cuckoo's Nest</i> on us,

279
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:51,119
we can cross "brain" off the list, diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.

280
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,916
Are you trying to make this easy for me?

281
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,319
By your own admission, if you give the patient steroids,

282
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,482
two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.

283
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,372
What was making the patient worse was not having a diagnosis.

284
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:05,260
This was the fastest way to get it. It was a perfect diagnostic moment.

285
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:07,431
In light of what happened,

286
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:10,032
you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?

287
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,033
Yes.

288
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:19,711
My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes.

289
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:26,662
It did not account for the disobedience of my own team.

290
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:33,913
What are you doing? I think you're right about the strep.

291
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:36,542
Can't hurt to biopsy the rash while we're waiting.

292
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,146
Thanks.

293
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:45,429
At the time, it seemed like a good idea.

294
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:47,656
I know this is hard,

295
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:51,995
but please tell me exactly what happened next.

296
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:58,126
Draw up a little anesthetic.

297
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:02,347
Two ccs Lidocaine.

298
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,597
Get away from me.

299
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:20,530
You're in a hospital. Calm down.

300
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,439
Code Grey!

301
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,199
So your position is that your team's disobedience caused this? That's not what I said.

302
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,771
You said you didn't anticipate their defiance.

303
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:33,142
You implied that all would have been fine otherwise.

304
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,988
So who do you blame, Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase?

305
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,303
Or both?

306
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,832
I don't blame either one.

307
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:47,674
So who do you blame, Dr. House?

308
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,897
Code Grey!

309
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,958
Get haloperidol.

310
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,033
Got it.

311
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:20,747
Oh, my God, Chase.

312
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,153
Prep the O.R. and get a gurney. Start an I.V.

313
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:47,742
Come on. The bleeder's got to be in here.

314
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:54,803
Got it. Which artery? It's his heart.

315
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,552
Fortunately, only the knife tip reached the cardiac muscle.

316
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:05,624
Made a laceration in the left ventricle about the size of the tip of my index finger.

317
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,137
At that moment, he could only stay alive

318
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:10,521
as long as my finger plugged the hole.

319
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,208
It could have been me on the floor. It should have been me. It was my theory.

320
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,789
I held the needle in front of the patient that set off his paranoia.

321
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,640
If you're looking for someone to blame...

322
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:27,462
blame me.

323
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:34,100
Please continue. Getting some ectopy.

324
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,833
Coming through. Good carotid pulse.

325
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:38,938
<i>Regular?</i> No. Got a PVC.

326
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:40,583
Got to move it, people.

327
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,715
My diagnostic test worked.

328
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:49,731
It proved the patient had a steroid-induced psychosis. And that's what you took away from this situation?

329
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:51,935
The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.

330
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:57,654
<i>Your colleague was stabbed.</i>
Are you telling me you didn't care?

331
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:02,698
How bad is it? <i>Bad.</i>

332
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:04,060
<i>Patch.</i>

333
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,572
<i>- Ready?</i>  <i>- I can't take my finger out.</i>

334
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:10,398
He'll bleed. I don't think he can take it.

335
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:13,148
<i>Oxygenation's at 100%.</i> He's as ready as he's gonna be.

336
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:16,823
We got to go for it. <i>On my count.</i>

337
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:21,574
One, two, three.

338
00:22:24,817 --> 00:22:26,120
Suture.

339
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:30,387
Got it. BP is stable.

340
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:33,287
Patch is holding.

341
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:39,165
What was his heart rate? He doesn't have one.

342
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,044
- He's on bypass. <i>- Not Chase.</i>

343
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:42,382
The patient.

344
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:48,443
You're DDX-ing? Park, come with me.

345
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:49,306
Taub's got this.

346
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:52,609
<i>My friend is here</i> because you didn't listen to me.

347
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,462
I did listen to you. Chase didn't listen to me.

348
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:58,314
<i>At this point,</i> being he makes you feel better.

349
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:00,825
You're not helping Chase or our patient.

350
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:03,324
Fine.

351
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,703
So he just walked out? There really was nothing for him to do.

352
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:09,752
Speaks to a certain callousness on Dr. House's part, don't you think?

353
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,424
Who cares if House was callous? Are you gonna punish callousness?

354
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,403
But you agree that empathy is a useful quality for doctors?

355
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:19,686
House is not the problem.
Your friend got stabbed.

356
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,738
He may die from those wounds.

357
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,504
If you had been in that room, maybe that could have been you. I wouldn't have been in the room.

358
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:30,469
Implicitly, you just said that Chase was at fault.

359
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:38,914
We all knew a psychotic episode was one of the three possible outcomes.

360
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:41,623
And Chase brought a scalpel in there.

361
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:45,765
He endangered Dr. Adams, he endangered himself, and he endangered the patient.

362
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:50,207
Thank you.

363
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,440
Lungs, rash, now excessive R-R variability.

364
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:55,833
Go.

365
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:03,900
<i>It's a hospital.</i>

366
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,272
There are lots of doctors who can take care of him.

367
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:09,354
And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room,

368
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:10,835
doing nothing?

369
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:14,839
If you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dedicated chemistry teacher

370
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,383
with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way.

371
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,888
She's not pregnant.

372
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:22,186
Would it make a difference? 'Cause I could knock her up.

373
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,284
- Autonomic dysregulation. - Shut up.

374
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,688
Could you guys keep it down?

375
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,739
You made it, Bud.

376
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:40,747
You're in the PACU. Been in surgery.

377
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,461
The anesthesia's just wearing off.

378
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,461
Did I have an epidural?

379
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,249
No.

380
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,473
'Cause I can't feel my legs.

381
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,024
Dr. Chase?

382
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:09,250
Robert? Yeah.

383
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,932
I'm Walter Cofield. I'm a neurologist over at--

384
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,558
I know who you are.

385
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:22,281
Good.

386
00:26:26,657 --> 00:26:29,193
Think you're up for answering a couple questions?

387
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:33,787
Well, it's not like I can get up and run away.

388
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,350
Wasn't my best joke.

389
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:46,330
I'm smiling because, for the last 12 hours,

390
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:49,691
I've been picturing you with orange hair.

391
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:51,096
I dyed it back.

392
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,284
Were you angry with Dr. House?

393
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,215
It was a prank. It wasn't uncommon.

394
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:13,553
<i>So I've heard.</i> <i>That doesn't mean</i> <i>you couldn't get angry.</i>

395
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:17,354
Might actually contribute to that reaction.

396
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,522
<i>Are you trying to prove</i> <i>that I was distracted,</i>

397
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:24,037
that my judgment was compromised?

398
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,523
Who do you think was at fault for what happened to you, Dr. Chase?

399
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:33,254
Again, why does it matter?
<i>You're a smart doctor.</i>

400
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:35,197
You know what happened here better than anyone,

401
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:37,816
and you've worked with Dr. House longer than anyone.

402
00:27:37,817 --> 00:27:41,837
And I suspect that you've spent every minute

403
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:45,113
since this has happened trying to answer that very question.

404
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:49,940
I don't think it was anyone's fault.

405
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:54,910
I was angry, but I wasn't distracted.

406
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:59,336
And I think that, if there's any chance I'm gonna walk again,

407
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:02,022
it's because Dr. House is a genius.

408
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:05,716
How about warmth? Can you feel the sheets on your skin?

409
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,395
<i>I just said</i> I don't feel anything.

410
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,592
Objectivity, House.

411
00:28:16,472 --> 00:28:18,756
What about posttraumatic syringomyelia?

412
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:24,398
<i>Syrinx formed</i> <i>in the subarachnoid space,</i> <i>blocking the flow</i> <i>of cerebrospinal fluid.</i>

413
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,460
That'd mean the damage was permanent.

414
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,731
No. Forget the nerves.

415
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:35,336
House, if it's total paralysis, he must have-- <i>not necessarily.</i>

416
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:38,991
Think arteries. <i>Blood flow to his spinal column</i> <i>is cut off.</i>

417
00:28:38,992 --> 00:28:40,466
<i>It's a clot</i> <i>in the radicular artery.</i>

418
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:44,356
That could be fixable. Prep a room for an embolectomy.

419
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:47,873
Let's get that thing out of there <i>before it does</i> <i>any more damage.</i>

420
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:52,068
Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.

421
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:56,211
You're through the aorta.

422
00:28:57,014 --> 00:28:59,768
<i>There.</i> Sensory level is at l5.

423
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:02,900
It must be the descending branch. Can I see the monitor?

424
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:05,095
Stop there. Shoot the dye.

425
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,531
There it is. <i>Don't get too excited.</i>

426
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:15,462
We still got to get it out. Still could have done permanent damage.

427
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:23,045
Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation. There's blood in his urine bag.

428
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:25,866
Kidneys are failing. House, not now. Got to be now.

429
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:29,576
<i>Foreman is transferring our guy</i> <i>to Princeton General</i> <i>as soon as there's</i> <i>a bed available.</i>

430
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:33,757
Says the doctors here can no longer be objective since the stabbing.

431
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:38,869
In the middle of a procedure that could basically save your life,

432
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,541
House is actually trying to drag people away?

433
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,286
How do you work with a guy like that? He wasn't trying to pull anybody away.

434
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,732
Everyone had already refused to work on that case.

435
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:51,186
He knew the answer.

436
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:56,473
<i>He wanted</i> <i>to check on me.</i> <i>But he needed an excuse.</i>

437
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:59,767
Otherwise, he could be accused of caring.

438
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:04,505
So your testimony is that

439
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:09,494
Dr. House's complete lack of concern is evidence of his deep concern?

440
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:18,835
Did you just do that?

441
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:21,715
What?

442
00:30:27,602 --> 00:30:29,052
Wiggle your toes.

443
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,784
Do you feel that?

444
00:30:45,763 --> 00:30:49,300
Congratulations. It was the clot.

445
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,197
<i>Short occlusion time</i> <i>of the artery,</i>

446
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:54,317
when the swelling goes down, you should...

447
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:57,374
<i>Gain back at least</i> <i>some of the function.</i>

448
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,576
One more thing. Sorry.

449
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:11,551
You knew that your patient was at risk for a psychotic break

450
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:14,955
when you brought a scalpel within his reach.

451
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,305
Why did you ignore that risk?

452
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,370
I thought I was right about the rash.

453
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:25,678
I would do it again.

454
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:31,885
I thought so.

455
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,765
<i>What, that's it?</i> <i>"I thought so"?</i>

456
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:38,329
What the hell does that mean?

457
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,426
You brazenly defied your boss.

458
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:49,081
Now that happened either because Dr. House has established

459
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:55,201
that that's okay in his world, or his prank war distracted you,

460
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:59,863
or House makes medicine a game, and you just wanted to beat him.

461
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:02,697
<i>Whatever the reason,</i> <i>it boils down to the fact</i>

462
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:07,509
<i>that you may never walk again</i> because House created an atmosphere

463
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,903
that promotes recklessness.

464
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:36,159
This will be our last round of questions.

465
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,564
I've spoken with Dr. Chase. You know he regained movement.

466
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:46,340
No.

467
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:02,692
Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr. Chase is hurt?

468
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:07,505
We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?

469
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:09,949
Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry--

470
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,404
I didn't do anything wrong.
It's not an admission of guilt.

471
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:15,582
He's your friend, and he's not well. He's a coworker.

472
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:19,852
Coworker whom you've known for almost ten years who nearly died

473
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:22,426
and who's still scared he may not walk.

474
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,371
Are you going to have me fired for bad manners?

475
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:33,256
Just trying to understand you.

476
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:37,131
Why a man in your position, with your abilities,

477
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,670
is incapable of shaking the impulse to act like an ass.

478
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,359
Could we go back on the record and get this over with?

479
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:49,888
Put the Vicodin away, Dr. House.

480
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:51,919
My leg hurts.

481
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:00,658
Is that supposed to be funny?

482
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:13,331
Two explosions.

483
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:22,208
We're not done here.

484
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:27,362
Hey, hold on.

485
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,409
Close it up. Take him out of there.

486
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,714
Dr. Foreman said you'd try this.

487
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:36,964
Said to tell you he's no longer your patient.
Let's go!

488
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:50,231
Wait.

489
00:34:52,514 --> 00:34:55,736
<i>Wait.</i> I have to get to my car.

490
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:58,887
Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.

491
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:02,195
You've been wrong every time.
Yeah, well, not this time.

492
00:35:02,196 --> 00:35:05,917
The explosion in the classroom caused the cancer cells to break open.

493
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:07,709
It's called tumor lysis syndrome.

494
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,223
His body's flooded with an excess of phosphates,

495
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:13,174
potassium, acids, all kinds of cancerous junk.

496
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:17,069
It explains the paralysis, the bleeding, the heart and kidney issues, everything.

497
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,204
What about the psychotic break?

498
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,997
Turns out we caused that.

499
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,729
This is treatable. Okay?

500
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:37,423
You have to tell the new doctors that he needs total body radiation and plasmapheresis.

501
00:35:37,424 --> 00:35:39,101
Move your cane, please.

502
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:56,326
Where's Cofield? He said you walked out.

503
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:59,965
Well, I'm walking back. I'm not done testifying. Apparently you were.

504
00:35:59,966 --> 00:36:02,196
Said he'd have his decision tomorrow.

505
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,612
<i>This case is a fiasco.</i>

506
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:55,140
Didn't sleep last night.

507
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:04,170
Dr. House is obviously brilliant...

508
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:08,945
Well, I think we've heard enough. But Dr. House is also a fiasco.

509
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:11,016
If I were to exonerate him,

510
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:13,969
<i>condone his completely</i> <i>reckless, immature,</i>

511
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,389
almost misanthropic behavior,

512
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,276
<i>I would essentially be</i> <i>sending a message</i> to all the other doctors in this hospital

513
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:21,460
that it's okay to act that way and--

514
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,683
Sorry.
We're in the middle of something.

515
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:26,150
<i>I know.</i> <i>I came to speak</i> <i>with Dr. House.</i>

516
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:28,508
And when they told me he was in here,

517
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:31,584
I thought I should say something.

518
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,401
<i>I mean...</i>

519
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:38,414
He wasn't the nicest doctor I've ever met.

520
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:42,696
Well, I think we've heard enough. <i>But he was right.</i>

521
00:38:43,932 --> 00:38:45,524
They found the tumor.

522
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,808
They are removing it, and they are starting plasmapheresis.

523
00:38:48,998 --> 00:38:50,803
<i>They expect</i> <i>a full recovery.</i>

524
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:56,546
He saved my husband's life.

525
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:00,613
<i>Well...</i>

526
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:02,278
I guess that's it.

527
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:04,686
Thanks again.

528
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:20,177
As I was saying, Dr. House's process

529
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:23,960
<i>is dangerous, inappropriate.</i>

530
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,444
But he is effective.

531
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:34,679
I've decided that I would be doing this hospital

532
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,786
a disservice if I did anything to change that process.

533
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,357
Congratulations, Dr. House.

534
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,283
This unfortunate stabbing incident is officially nobody's fault.

535
00:40:08,596 --> 00:40:09,974
Coward.

536
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:14,857
Excuse me?
<i>You've got, like, 20 pages</i> <i>of notes there.</i>

537
00:40:14,858 --> 00:40:17,869
You were expecting to bore us for at least half an hour.

538
00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:22,985
You got my parole form in here.

539
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:25,955
<i>You were gonna send me</i> <i>back to prison.</i> House, stop.

540
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:29,718
Good things usually happen; <i>bad things sometimes happen.</i>

541
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:34,320
<i>The fact</i> <i>that that would-be widow</i> <i>came in just in time</i> <i>to sob</i> all over your soft, mushy heart

542
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:39,192
and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.

543
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:15,162
How'd you get the firing wire

544
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:17,865
into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?

545
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:24,687
Why'd I even have to? What was the point of the orange hair?

546
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,943
Your hair smelled like Adams.

547
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,575
And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing,

548
00:41:30,576 --> 00:41:32,924
it means you were just doing her shampoo.

549
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:38,346
Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or because there is no new girl.

550
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:40,631
<i>You were trying to make up time</i> <i>by showering at the hospital</i>

551
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:43,228
because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo.

552
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:46,387
So I found a way to let you know <i>to not be late.</i>

553
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:48,341
You couldn't just ask me to stop being late?

554
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,024
What fun would that be?

555
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:54,695
None of this is fun, House.

556
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:08,894
They decided that your being stabbed...

557
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,505
Was nobody's fault.

558
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,672
They're wrong.

559
00:42:27,698 --> 00:42:29,097
I'm sorry.

560
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:37,882
Anything else? I'm kind of busy.

561
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:48,929
No. That was it.

562
00:42:52,316 --> 00:42:52,979
I've got it.

563
00:42:52,980 --> 00:43:01,070
