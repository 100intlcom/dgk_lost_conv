1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,210
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

2
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,050
What do you want to do next?

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,800
Uh, swings?

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,490
Okay. Um, crawl tube?

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,240
Nah. Nah?

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,630
Well, I think we're running out of options, honey.

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,960
I want to go on the merry-go-round. The m- again?

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,520
But this time all by myself.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,640
I don't know, jellybean. Daddy, I'm six.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,570
I'm not a baby anymore.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,910
Please?

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,220
PINWHEELS

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,130
???

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,110
Thank you.

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,770
You ready? Uh-huh.

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,450
All right.
Come here.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,980
I'll take beary.

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,060
Mm. Now you promise you're not gonna tell mommy, right?

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,530
She'll kick my butt if she finds out.

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,180
Pinky swear.

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,650
All right. Go get 'em.

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,250
<i>Remember to hold on tight. I will.</i>

23
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,580
Stop the ride!

24
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,490
Emily!

25
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,260
Emily, where are you?

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,830
<i>Em?</i>

27
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,340
<i>Emily?</i>

28
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,710
Emily?

29
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,510
Emily, where are you, honey?

30
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,350
Oh, Em.

31
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,600
Emily.

32
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,360
Honey?

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,430
Help me!

34

豪斯医生  第八季第19集</font>

37
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,500
Is that our precious little bundle of tumor?

38
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,570
They grow up so fast, don't they?

39
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,960
<i>How did you know I was here?</i>
How do you think?

40
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,410
Foreman.

41
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,360
Actually, that would have been easier.
No, I followed you.

42
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,230
It didn't occur to you that that might mean I don't want you involved in my cancer treatment?

43
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,790
I'm not here as a doctor. I'm here as a towering pillar of strength.

44
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,570
Be a pillar in the parking lot. No.

45
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>How many times have I told you</i> I wanted to be alone and you've made yourself a pain in the ass?

46
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,490
I owe you.

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,130
My word, not a word.

48
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,020
Realizing I'm most likely going to regret this,

49
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,620
all right.

50
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,050
What-what are you doing?

51
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,510
My best friend has cancer.

52
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,840
Cut me some slack.

53
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,160
Also, spring break.

54
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,380
I'm on vacation.

55
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,270
Although looking at you now, I can tell the wet T-shirt contest

56
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,750
is probably gonna suck.

57
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,200
House taking time off is a bad sign.

58
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,180
"A bad sign. "

59
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,030
You think the apocalypse is coming because House wants to be there for Wilson?

60
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,740
Yes. You're new.

61
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,230
We got a case.

62
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,340
<i>Six-year-old with a nosebleed</i> and breathing problems.

63
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,560
She was born with a rare mutation of A-T.

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,260
Emily has a unique variant on both of her ATM genes.

65
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,260
Her disorder mimics A-T, but not all of the symptoms.

66
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,200
This is Dr. Elizabeth Lawson.

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,810
She's a developmental geneticist attached to JHU and an expert on the girl's condition.

68
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,690
Elizabeth Lawson.

69
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,270
Emily Lawson.

70
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,750
I'm here as a doctor, not a mother.

71
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,050
Nosebleeds and breathing problems are common symptoms of ataxia telangiectasia.

72
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,240
We could just be seeing <i>the natural progression- - It's not.</i>

73
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,530
A- T patients have a life expectancy of 20 years.

74
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,050
Emily is only six. It's something else.

75
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,130
I examined her lungs two days ago. They're functioning normally.

76
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,200
It says she fell off a carousel. Head trauma-

77
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,210
If the diagnosis was easy, I wouldn't need you people.

78
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,270
I'm here because, according to Eric, <i>you're the best.</i>

79
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,490
<i>We are.</i>

80
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,430
Have you considered Wegener's granulomatosis?

81
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,760
It's a good fit.

82
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,060
But she can't have X-rays.
<i>A- T makes her hypersensitive to ionizing radiation.</i>

83
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,140
I'll get her prepped for an MRI.

84
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,990
She knows more about her daughter's genetic condition
than any of you.

85
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,970
She'll be an asset.

86
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,410
<i>Or she won't,</i>

87
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,610
Eric.

88
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,620
This isn't a request. Use her.

89
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,970
The tumor's spread to the surrounding tissue.

90
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,680
We're gonna have to shrink it before we remove it surgically.

91
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,260
I'm more interested in exactly how you plan to do that, Mike.

92
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,620
We start conservative.
Daily radiation treatments for three weeks.

93
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,590
And, if it doesn't shrink enough after that, we'll add the chemo-

94
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,150
And, if it hasn't shrunk enough after that, I'm dead.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,010
Look, you have over a 75% chance that the radiation alone is enough.

96
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,500
Relax. Caught this in time.

97
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,220
Catching it in time would have been before it invaded the tissue around my thymus.

98
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,840
I want the radiation and the chemo concurrently.

99
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,710
Why stress your immune system unnecessarily?

100
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,080
Let's just go with my plan, okay?

101
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,850
The radiation first
- I'm gonna get a second opinion.

102
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,550
Are you serious?

103
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,940
Look, I've seen you recommend this exact treatment

104
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,550
dozens of times. We're done here.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,170
I'll look for a doctor with some actual balls.

106
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,280
Hey, you need to talk to your friend. <i>He's embarrassing himself.</i>

107
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,840
A doctor should be able to handle his own illness <i>with a little bit more dignity.</i>

108
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,560
I agree with Wilson. My recommended treatment is sound.

109
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,880
No, I meant about the ball-less part.
Explains the office.

110
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,820
<i>It was a merry-go-round.</i>

111
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,670
She's a kid, Liz. We were having fun.
You should try it sometime.

112
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,770
Fun? She's six, not you.

113
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,260
You know she has balance issues.

114
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,410
I know that she's-

115
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,190
This is Emily's father, Simon.

116
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,280
He was with her when the symptoms occurred.

117
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,610
I had her all week. She was fine. We could come back.

118
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,380
No need. Patient's ready for transport.

119
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,830
Wake up, sleepy head.

120
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,050
<i>I saw it in the gift shop.</i>

121
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,800
I know how much you like them.
Thanks.

122
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,090
They're gonna take you for an MRI now.

123
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,940
It means "magic really cool images. "

124
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,120
I thought it stood for "magnetic resonance imaging. "

125
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,360
We've spent a lot of time in hospitals.

126
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,470
B-9.

127
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,690
- Hit. And I hate you.

128
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,030
Ugh. I'm done. I sunk your battleship?

129
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,190
No. But I think I'm gonna puke.

130
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,970
Good. Now that you're sufficiently buzzed,

131
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,860
what was the reason behind you freaking out on Kondo?

132
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,170
Are you scared? Are you in denial?

133
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,890
I know you get confused any time someone thinks that you're wrong,

134
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,660
but it's not considered freaking out for a patient to ask for a second opinion.

135
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,990
Okay, well, here it is.

136
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,370
Kondo is right. You should be in radiology right now.

137
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,700
Well done. You've kept your word for almost two hours.

138
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,490
Every day you wait, our pal toomie is growing larger in your chest.

139
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,750
If you want to live, stop screwing around and do something about it.

140
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,340
Good idea.

141
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,440
I think I'll start with spending spring break

142
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,880
on my own.

143
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,120
How you feeling in there, Emily? <i>Good, I guess.</i>

144
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,310
Is something wrong?

145
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,830
I was only pretending to be asleep.

146
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,180
<i>You think that's dishonest?</i>

147
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,120
Uh, that's-

148
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,540
My daughters do that too.

149
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,560
But they know that sometimes, when it seems like mommy and daddy are fighting, it's really

150
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,960
only because they're worried about you.

151
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,060
And does your wife ever want a divorce?

152
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,700
No. Everything's fine at home.

153
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,690
Hold still now. No more talking.

154
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,390
What do you think of her mother?

155
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,820
She called her daughter "the patient".

156
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,530
If my kids were born with an expiration date,

157
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,670
<i>- I don't- - Ow!</i>

158
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,900
Where does it hurt?
I want my daddy. Where's my daddy?

159
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,840
We were able to restore circulation to her hands

160
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,760
and feet before any permanent damage set in.
Primary Raynaud's?

161
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,410
The cold inside the MRI room could have set it off.

162
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,590
Stress can also precipitate the condition.

163
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,390
She's shown no evidence of cold sensitivity, and she has no problems with MRI machines.

164
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,620
<i>There are other kinds of stress.</i>
She heard you and your husband fighting.

165
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,350
Unfortunately, she's heard a lot worse than that before.

166
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,830
<i>It's not stress.</i>

167
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,640
Could be secondary Raynaud's.

168
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,500
<i>Lupus is consistent with Emily's symptoms.</i>

169
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,010
<i>Her lymph nodes aren't enlarged,</i>
and she has shown no signs

170
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,010
of immune activation.

171
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,920
It could be heavy metal poisoning.
From what? The carousel?

172
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,500
<i>She was only on it for a minute.</i>

173
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,320
Simon moved into an old apartment building three weeks ago.

174
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,760
<i>I'm sure he has no idea</i> what the insulation's made of,

175
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,600
what kind of paint.

176
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,090
He's a good father, but when it comes to Emily's health-

177
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,670
<i>I'm gonna get his keys</i> <i>and check for environmentals.</i>

178
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,770
Lupus is a better fit.

179
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,550
I don't mean to pull rank here, but I am her mother.

180
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,240
I thought you said you were here as a doctor.

181
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,090
And as a doctor, I need parental consent.
See above.

182
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,010
<i>While I'm gone,</i>

183
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,160
please start her on Chelation Therapy.

184
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,040
She's the mother.

185
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,290
So let's treat her like any other mother.

186
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,340
I think we just hit the environmental mother lode.

187
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,820
Funny she never mentioned an entire basement

188
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,870
full of dangerous chemicals and drugs.

189
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,740
You think she'd even let Emily down here?

190
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,080
Yeah.

191
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,650
Apparently a lot.

192
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,470
You ever heard of Lex-2? Read about it.

193
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,920
It's an experimental aminoglycoside antibiotic.

194
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,910
Supposedly it can override DNA errors in the ATM gene.

195
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,290
Doesn't mean she's giving it to her daughter.

196
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,230
Anyone studying A-T would be researching it.

197
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,890
How?

198
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,440
You see any lab rats down here?

199
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,060
The only cage I see is right there.

200
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,910
Go away.

201
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,340
I have a headache.

202
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,400
We don't have to have sex.

203
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,980
Sometimes it's nice just to cuddle and talk.

204
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,950
Me first. You don't want a second opinion.

205
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,280
You're already on your fifth.

206
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,710
<i>You got Evans at Mercy, Shaw at County,</i> Foster at Johns Hopkins.

207
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,740
And every one of them has given you the same advice.

208
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,380
You're nuts.

209
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,030
You don't just want chemo.

210
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,450
You want a dose so high,

211
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,940
there's a one-in-three chance it'll kill you outright.

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,550
Question is,

213
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,680
why didn't you tell me?

214
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,890
Because you knew I'd stop you.

215
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,850
<i>Which means you've already found someone</i>

216
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,460
<i>insane enough</i> or desperate enough

217
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,380
to give you what amounts to a death dose of chemicals.

218
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,100
But who would be that stupid?

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,170
I'm thinking that the who is you.

220
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,090
Where exactly were you planning on killing yourself?

221
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,410
'Cause I don't think Foreman is gonna let you do it here.

222
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,030
My place.

223
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,740
I've been stockpiling equipment. No.

224
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,800
No! Stop.

225
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,530
I'm still healthy.

226
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,250
Why not go the extreme route now when there's a better chance of surviving it?

227
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,450
Statistically, this treatment has about the same chance

228
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,680
of killing you as the thymoma does.

229
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,150
But a hell of a lot faster.

230
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,150
Nancy Wells, cervical cancer,
70% survival rate.

231
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,510
Died November 6, 1998,

232
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,570
64 years old.

233
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,780
Bernie Jones, melanoma, 89% survival rate.

234
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,630
October 10, 1999.
He was 52.

235
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,520
John Taylor.
Thyroid.

236
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,400
96% survival rate.

237
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,050
I promised him he'd be fine.

238
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,280
Eight years old.

239
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,180
I am not going to die slowly
in a hospital bed under fluorescent lighting

240
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,570
with people stopping by to gawk and lie about how I look.

241
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,250
Even a small chance of that happening is too big a chance for me.

242
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,960
You're an idiot.

243
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,250
And the odds say you're gonna die.

244
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,160
We'll do it at my place.

245
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,220
The only environmental factors we think

246
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,040
caused your daughter's illness are the ones you shot her full of.

247
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,430
I tested the drug. This is what I did for a living for ten years.

248
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,880
She's your child, not a Guinea pig. I tested it first.

249
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,240
On myself.

250
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,430
And in six months, I didn't document
any adverse effects.

251
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,770
A trial of one is basically irrelevant.

252
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,420
Respiratory infections are common with A-T.

253
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,210
With Emily's mutation, they are deadly,
and they get worse every year.

254
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,930
Lex-2 won't be approved for at least the next five years.

255
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,160
Emily, on the other hand,

256
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,500
wouldn't have survived the winter.

257
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,160
What was I supposed to do?

258
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,850
There's a reason for FDA requirements.

259
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,380
A study at Jackson Memorial- I know about Gaines' research.

260
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,530
He's publishing next month. Was. I just spoke to him.

261
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,060
His team just linked the use of Lex-2 to renal failure in mice and rats.

262
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,650
<i>She needs an ultrasound guided renal biopsy</i>

263
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,180
to check the damage. Hopefully it's reversible.

264
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,120
PATIENT CASE SYSTEMS

265
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,600
To stupidity.

266
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,140
<i>Mm, not quite done.</i>

267
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,440
To muscle aches, spasms.

268
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,120
To your joints feeling like they're being ripped out and replaced with shards of broken glass.

269
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,440
Should I be writing any of this down?

270
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,120
<i>Your stomach fills with bile.</i>

271
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,020
When you vomit, it feels like someone's forcing
a white hot hammer down your esophagus,

272
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,320
<i>tearing your flesh.</i>

273
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,740
<i>Blood's dripping down the back of your throat,</i> choking and gagging you

274
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,320
with the slick, coppery taste of burnt pennies.

275
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,990
I am an Oncologist. I know-

276
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,320
If you did, we wouldn't be sitting here.

277
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,100
Day two: Your white blood cells are gone,

278
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,820
<i>opening up your system to attack.</i>

279
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,340
Your temperature skyrockets.
One second, your skin feels like it's on fire.

280
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,520
The next second, it's entombed in ice.

281
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,850
Every pain sensor in your body is firing at the same time

282
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,700
<i>until agony isn't even a word or a concept-</i>

283
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,170
<i>it's your only reality.</i> You hallucinate.

284
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,340
You dream of death.

285
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,570
<i>And then the race begins.</i>

286
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,960
<i>Can your body claw its way back in time</i>

287
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,530
<i>before the hostile organisms and parasites</i>

288
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,260
<i>claim you permanently?</i>

289
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,880
Win, you live. Lose, you die.

290
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,820
Now what are we doing here, Wilson?

291
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,910
Kidney number one looks good.

292
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,690
Which means we'll probably take the biopsy from two.

293
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,040
Hey, you're doing great.

294
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,250
Brave as always.

295
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,470
Pretty cool, eh?

296
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,170
You want to try?

297
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,790
<i>What's wrong?</i> My chest hurts.

298
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,540
It's definitely not her kidneys.
It's okay.

299
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,930
Promise this'll taste just as good coming up as it did going down.

300
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,240
If things go wrong, <i>I just want you to know-</i>

301
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,340
If you're gonna say that you've always been secretly gay for me,

302
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,850
everyone always just kind of assumed it.

303
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,040
I just want you to know...

304
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,530
That I appreciate the risk you're taking...

305
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,060
Pumping a human being full of lethal chemicals in your living room.

306
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,030
If I die, it probably won't go over well with your probation officer.

307
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,040
That's not gonna be an issue.

308
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,710
I'm glad at least one of us is confident.

309
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,110
<i>Not me.</i>

310
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,990
I've already identified a couple of spots to dump your body

311
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,180
if this goes south.

312
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,130
I've always enjoyed Trinity Park.

313
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,930
It does have a nice access to the lake.

314
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,720
<i>Muscle spasms already?</i>

315
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,890
No. It's nothing really.

316
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,950
Good news.

317
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,550
Takes most people two bags to get to that stage.

318
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,500
You're way ahead of schedule.

319
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,730
<i>You'll think it's stupid.</i> <i>That hasn't stopped you before.</i>

320
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,970
I just always thought,

321
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,410
when I got old or sick,

322
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,750
I'd have a wife or kids to look after me.

323
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,710
<i>And in this scenario,</i> <i>are your loving wife and kids</i>

324
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,540
holding the life support cord,

325
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,300
<i>or are they thumbing through your will?</i>

326
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,790
I'm in it, right?

327
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,290
You have everything you need right here.

328
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,560
We both do.

329
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,910
Painkiller. <i>Industrial strength.</i>

330
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,870
Level: Awesome.

331
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,350
We're on vacation.

332
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,090
That is nice.

333
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,000
GREGORY HOUSE M.D
DEPARTMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC MEDICINE

334
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,110
<i>Her kidneys are fine.</i>

335
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,570
I don't think we're looking at side effects from the Lex-2.

336
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,310
She's prone to respiratory infection.

337
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,240
- Pneumonia? - No persistent cough, chills, or excess sweating.

338
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,650
What about a pulmonary embolism? Fits coughing up blood, but a clot?

339
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,100
From what?
Bruising from when she fell off the carousel.

340
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,490
<i>Contusion damages a deep vein,</i>
causes a clot.

341
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,680
A piece breaks off, travels to her lungs.

342
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,740
We need to get her on heparin now.

343
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,850
Another embolism could cause a heart attack or a stroke.

344
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,460
What's wrong? Is it Emily?

345
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,850
Sort of.

346
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,910
<i>You can't do this.</i>

347
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,620
I'm taking her to Mercy.

348
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,460
Everything you people have done has just made her worse.

349
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,350
You don't have the right. We have joint custody.

350
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,530
Where was my right when you were treating our daughter like a lab rat?

351
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,910
should ????

352
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,720
Stop it.

353
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,280
Your daughter deserves better than this.

354
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,740
It's okay, sweetie.

355
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,630
Mommy and I are just gonna talk.

356
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,750
<i>Okay?</i> You want to get some candy?

357
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,210
We believe Emily has a clot in her lungs.

358
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,800
If you leave now, she could die before her new doctors are even up to speed.

359
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,080
From her A-T? From the fall off the carousel.

360
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,220
Now can we just stop blaming each other and do the right thing here?

361
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,160
You're really gonna equate the two?

362
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,070
No, you were giving her two minutes of fun.

363
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,380
I was trying to save her life.

364
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,540
What's her best friend's name?

365
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,920
What's the name of her favorite teacher?

366
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,200
Why does she hate that stuffed animal you gave her?

367
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,090
She's been having nightmares about penguins all month.

368
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,050
What's her blood type?

369
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,650
Rh factor? Her serum immunoglobulin levels?

370
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,420
I don't care. Those are letters and numbers.

371
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,540
- That's not her. - What about the variant in her e14 ATM intergenic promoter region?

372
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,150
Because that's what's killing your daughter.

373
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,820
Unless I can find a way to reactivate it.

374
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,020
Just make her better.

375
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,840
<i>You don't look too good, mister.</i>

376
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,850
How did you get in here? The door.

377
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,250
Are you, like, sick or something?

378
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,190
Where's House?

379
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,560
Where are your parents?

380
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,380
Oh, I know you. You live in the building, right?

381
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,510
<i>What's your name?</i>

382
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,200
You don't remember?

383
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,650
House.

384
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,630
You promised me I'd go home again, Dr. Wilson.

385
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,410
You said it wasn't my fault.

386
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,020
It wasn't, John.

387
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,730
If I didn't do nothing wrong, why did I die?

388
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,370
<i>I don't know.</i>

389
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,280
Look...

390
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,810
I shouldn't have done this.

391
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,950
Am I dead?

392
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,220
Not yet.

393
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,150
It just feels that way. Are you okay?

394
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,220
I mean, apart from the pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps?

395
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,100
<i>I worked six months in a research lab</i>
<i>after med school.</i>

396
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,540
You get so focused.

397
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,060
Once I didn't eat for two days.

398
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,070
It's easy to forget what actually matters.

399
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,360
I didn't.

400
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,820
Yeah, it sucks I got her the wrong doll, but...

401
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,750
Good news.

402
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,040
Emily's lungs are clear.

403
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,580
No clot. And bad news. We still don't know what's happening to her.

404
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,170
Whatever it is, there's liver involvement.

405
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,000
Her eyes are jaundiced.

406
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,670
<i>Her liver's failing.</i>

407
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,060
<i>We found a blockage in her hepatic vein,</i>

408
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,130
<i>which is restricting blood flow to her liver.</i> <i>Polycythemia vera?</i>

409
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,520
<i>Red blood counts are normal.</i>

410
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,770
<i>Could be some sort of connective tissue disorder.</i>

411
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,380
What if-

412
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,190
what if we're just seeing the end result

413
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,000
<i>of her condition?</i>

414
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,450
She's unique.

415
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,960
One screwed-up gene from each of us.

416
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,560
<i>Let's stick with our process.</i>

417
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,340
I shouldn't be here.

418
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,740
<i>What are we missing?</i>
Advanced Lyme disease.

419
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,080
Would have seen it in the blood.
He said advanced.

420
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,510
We wouldn't pick it up in her blood if it's in her organs and nervous system now.

421
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,030
It fits everything but the nosebleed.

422
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,430
But why is it attacking now, all at once?

423
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,170
What's changed?

424
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,410
Elizabeth has.

425
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,970
<i>She stopped giving Emily the Lex-2.</i>

426
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,970
<i>It's an aminoglycoside antibiotic.</i>

427
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,650
It's what was keeping the Lyme in check.

428
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,230
We need to start her on amoxicillin.

429
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,000
You lied. Doesn't taste better coming back up.

430
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,740
Here's another one. You look good.

431
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,690
What's the white blood cell count?

432
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,530
It's down to 1,000, still dropping.

433
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,470
I need more morphine.

434
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,710
We're out.

435
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,150
You've been using my personal supply of painkillers for the last eight hours.

436
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,490
You have- you have enough for both of us?

437
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,310
I've got enough stashed around here for a minyan.

438
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,030
Just remember they're a gift.

439
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,090
So it's rude to keep throwing them up.

440
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,680
Found that out with those candlesticks you got me.

441
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,380
We think it's Lyme.

442
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,850
<i>I would have seen signs of that.</i> Not if the Lex-2 was keeping it in check.

443
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,400
We live in the city. We don't have pets.

444
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,880
She's never even been in the woods.

445
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,140
Yes, I have. With daddy.

446
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,240
I should have told you, <i>but I know how you feel about it.</i>

447
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,770
I grew up hunting with my dad.

448
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,390
I wanted to share it with my daughter <i>at least once.</i>

449
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,470
We only took pictures. You don't need to be mad.

450
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,400
<i>Maybe we should step outside.</i> <i>No.</i>

451
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,280
We can't protect her from everything.

452
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,650
I assume you'll need a lumbar puncture to confirm.

453
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,870
<i>You lost a contact?</i>

454
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,490
Going to the little boy's room.

455
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,850
They're called adult diapers for a reason.

456
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,680
Use it.

457
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,930
I did, and if you think I'm gonna let you change me-

458
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:17,480
It's okay. I'm a doctor. <i>Just leave me alone.</i>

459
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,700
It's pathetic.

460
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,750
I'm pathetic.

461
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,520
An oncologist with cancer.
Of all the things that could be killing me...

462
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,990
It's like the universe is giving me
the big middle finger.

463
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,180
The universe doesn't care-

464
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,020
<i>Why me?</i>

465
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,890
I'm always telling my patients

466
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,830
not to torture themselves, because there's no answer.

467
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,420
Sound advice. It's cruel advice.

468
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,320
They were just trying to make sense of what was happening to them,

469
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,870
and I'm there telling them not to bother?

470
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,560
I should have spent my life being more like you.

471
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,500
Should have been a manipulative, self-centered,

472
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,230
narcissistic ass who brought misery to everything and everyone

473
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,770
in his life.

474
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,050
You'd still have cancer. Yeah!

475
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,470
But at least I'd feel like I deserved it.

476
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,980
Do you think my parents will get back together?

477
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,270
I don't know.

478
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,780
I'm sure they love each other, but- They only fight about me.

479
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,500
That's because they care so much.

480
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,870
So maybe when I die,

481
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,050
they'll get back together.

482
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,280
Emily, what's wrong?
I can't move my arm.

483
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,840
Just keep your arms up for me.

484
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,370
What's happening to her? She's having a stroke.

485
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,110
Okay, your heart rate's up, BP's tanking.

486
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,150
White blood count's at 500. We have to go to the hospital now.

487
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,300
No. I don't have the equipment or the meds to handle this.

488
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,710
No. Win or lose.

489
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,780
Win or lose. That was the deal.

490
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,440
That was the deal when there was an "or".

491
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,450
You can't win this.

492
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,380
No.

493
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,060
No. I'd rather die here.

494
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,220
Not in an ambulance.

495
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,740
Not in a hospital.

496
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,340
Please, you can't do that to me.

497
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,650
I can't-

498
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,990
House...

499
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,490
Please.

500
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,610
Promise me that you won't do that to me.

501
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,140
Promise me.

502
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,120
Okay, I promise.

503
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,690
Stroke.

504
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,920
Blockage in her hepatic vein, coughing blood,

505
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,860
trouble breathing, and Raynaud's.

506
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,300
If we hadn't already ruled it out, it sounds like textbook pulmonary embolism.

507
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,180
What mimics a clot but isn't a clot?

508
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,650
Fungal infection. Her CSF was clean.

509
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,660
No bacterial or fungal markers.
<i>Anyone tried calling House?</i>

510
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,940
<i>Not picking up.</i> <i>Or returning messages or texts.</i>

511
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,610
We're on our own here, so just give me some theories we can use.

512
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,980
Hematologic malignancies.

513
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,830
A- T patients are more prone to that form of cancer.

514
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,300
You think cancer would present <i>and kill her in three days?</i>

515
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,160
Not cancer.

516
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,850
But a tumor could act like a clot.

517
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,040
An atrial myxoma.

518
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,930
A primary heart tumor.

519
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,390
The swinging motion of the myxoma intermittently blocked the flow of blood through the right atrium.

520
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,910
Inflow blockage stagnated the hepatic vein, which clotted and caused liver failure.

521
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,250
Outflow blockage caused the Raynaud's phenomenon and stroke.

522
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,860
Pieces of the tumor broke off and lodged in the lungs,

523
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,860
<i>causing Emily's breathing problems</i> <i>and the coughing blood.</i>

524
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,600
We'll remove the tumor surgically, and hopefully the biopsy reveals it's benign.

525
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,120
Wow. You-
you really look like crap.

526
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,630
Been fighting a cold lately.

527
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,950
Seven to ten days for the swelling to go down.

528
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,430
Then we rescan and schedule the surgery.

529
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,750
I seem to recall

530
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,830
I said some things to you- <i>You talked a lot.</i>

531
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,740
I stopped listening

532
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,600
after you confessed your fear of dolphins.

533
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,480
Can we just tone down the bromance a few notches? My leg is killing me.

534
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,200
One last favor.

535
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,330
I'd like to actually make it to the bathroom this time.

536
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,280
I thought you said you had plenty of Vicodin.

537
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,210
Everybody lies.

538
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,350
So the way I felt, you feel that, what,

539
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,140
most of the time?

540
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,310
It really does suck being you, doesn't it? At least I don't have cancer.

541
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,690
The tumor was benign.

542
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,990
<i>And we were able to remove all of it.</i>

543
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,530
Does this mean I'm not sick anymore?

544
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,960
No, honey.

545
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,620
<i>The tumor didn't cause</i>

546
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,660
<i>your genetic condition.</i>

547
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,470
You're still sick.

548
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,980
<i>But we never let that stop us before, right?</i>

549
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,300
So what do you want to do when we get out of here?

550
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,940
Have you been to the aquarium?

551
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,880
It's pretty cool. 

552
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,150
Can we go, daddy? You bet.

553
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,290
Me too?

554
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,370
Can she come with us?

555
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,050
You know mommy never has to ask.

556
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,710
I'll see you at lunch.

557
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:07,930
