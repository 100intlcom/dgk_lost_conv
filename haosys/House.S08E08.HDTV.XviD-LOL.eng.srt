1
00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:02,767
And you're sure he didn't leave until after 9:00?

2
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:06,152
Absolutely. We watched the Devils demolish the Rangers.

3
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:07,522
<i>The game started at 7:00.</i>

4
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:11,811
Neither of you stepped out between periods, get beer, <i>pick up a pizza?</i> - <i>We stayed at my place.</i>

5
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,541
We were together the whole time.

6
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:15,796
And you said the Devils won? - <i>Yup. 4-zip.</i>

7
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:20,395
<i>Kovalchuk had two,</i> <i>Arnott and Parise each had one,</i> and Marty got the shutout.

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,362
I'm sorry. Marty? Martin Brodeur.

9
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:26,963
Devils' starting goalie for, like, the past 20 years.

10
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:28,640
<i>He played awesome</i> <i>as usual.</i>

11
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,207
Your Honor, may I submit the sports page

12
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,400
from the <i>New Jersey Chronicle</i> on October 9th, 2011.

13
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,588
Objection. Relevance. Goes to the witness's credibility.

14
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,004
Go quickly.

15
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,527
Would you please read the caption under the photo?

16
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:49,422
"Martin Brodeur stops 1

17
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:53,262
of his 36 saves on the way to a shutout victory."

18
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,544
That's what I just said.

19
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:58,184
That the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery

20
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:01,032
because he was with you watching Martin Brodeur shut out the Rangers.

21
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,174
Yes. Thank you.

22
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:08,697
Your Honor, may I submit the <i>Chronicle</i> sports page from October 10th?

23
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:10,872
Your Honor. This is what you call going quickly?

24
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:13,226
Just two more questions. I promise.

25
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,868
Please read the highlighted text at the bottom of the page.

26
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:21,947
"In Sunday's sports section,

27
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:26,213
New Jersey Devils goaltender Johan Hedberg was..."

28
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,947
That's it. Keep going.

29
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:36,590
"Misidentified as Martin Brodeur

30
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:39,150
<i>in a photo caption</i> <i>and box score."</i>

31
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,346
An understandable mistake.

32
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:49,064
Given that Martin Brodeur was scheduled to start

33
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:53,171
but bowed out after taking a shot to the throat in warm-up.

34
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:57,114
Which brings me to my most relevant question.

35
00:01:57,426 --> 00:02:00,788
Did you and the defendant spend the evening of October 8th

36
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:02,625
watching the Devils game on TV,

37
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,617
<i>or did you just read</i> <i>about the game in the</i> Chronicle

38
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,193
while concocting this false alibi?

39
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,419
<i>I...</i> <i>I, um...</i>

40
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,850
Excuse me, Your Honor, may I approach?

41
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,515
You sure you don't want to wait till after he answers your question?

42
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,728
No.

43
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,377
I'm gonna need a continuance.

44
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,151
Now?

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,585
You're one answer away from destroying their whole defense.

46
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:28,634
- Come on. - Oh, shut up.

47
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:29,870
You know it's true.

48
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:32,054
- Let's finish this up. - I can't.

49
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,380
Why the hell not?

50
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:37,760
Because I think I'm having a heart attack.

51
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,686
<i>Great. Call an ambulance.</i>

52

10055
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:22,889
Thinks he had a heart attack but didn't.

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,875
His EKG, cardiac enzymes, and catheterization are all normal.

57
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,071
'Cause it's an anxiety attack.

58
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:32,734
Probably because he just turned 40 and still goes by the name "Tommy".

59
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:35,399
It's not anxiety. The E.R. Docs interviewed his wife.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,143
She confirmed he's been feeling fine.

61
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:38,953
Nothing out of the ordinary at work or at home.

62
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:42,607
Probably also believes that he thinks Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.

63
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:46,108
Which is why I had them admit him anyway and treat with alprazolam.

64
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,111
No improvements.

65
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:50,567
Because... Because for some patients the diagnosis of anxiety disorder

66
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:54,819
can actually increase anxiety, which is also why I told him

67
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,711
he had a minor respiratory infection that was easily curable by the medication.

68
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:02,956
You lied? I ruled out heart attack and anxiety disorder.

69
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,385
Interesting.

70
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:09,527
I know.

71
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,877
Impressive.

72
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:20,081
What, the wiliness with which Foreman ruled out anxiety

73
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:23,481
or his complete wiliness-less-ness

74
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:24,803
before he met me?

75
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:29,228
The fact that you managed to smear jelly on nearly every page.

76
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:31,993
Shingles could cause chest pain before a rash appeared.

77
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:35,353
Pain would be restricted to one dermatome. It wouldn't cross them.

78
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:39,558
Asthma-induced pneumothorax would <i>and might not show up</i> <i>on a posteroanterior X-ray.</i>

79
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:42,861
No history of asthma. They did a lateral view as well.

80
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:45,818
No sign of a pneumothorax or deep sulcus sign.

81
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,691
I treated an inmate once with similar symptoms

82
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:50,031
after he tried to poison his cellmate with chlorine gas.

83
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:53,142
He didn't realize sharing a cell also meant sharing the air?

84
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:55,961
<i>Chlorine gas pools</i> <i>near the ground</i> he thought he'd be safe in the top bunk.

85
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,204
Well, why would anyone try to poison our guy?

86
00:04:58,205 --> 00:04:59,873
<i>He makes a living</i> <i>sending people to prison.</i>

87
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:04,351
But he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.

88
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:08,815
Which is why Arceus created a universe <i>with 3 states of matter</i>

89
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:12,683
and 300 solid or liquid poisons that could cause his symptoms.

90
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,234
Arceus?

91
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,183
Look it up. And alkalinize his urine.

92
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,667
Go search his home, talk to his wife, see if you can get her to tell us what she used.

93
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,270
Wait, why would you think his wife poisoned him?

94
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:28,340
Because dangerous people don't break into your home, they live in it.

95
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:32,106
<i>And although his kids</i> <i>are old enough</i> to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.

96
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:35,309
<i>Must be such a pleasure</i> to live in your head.

97
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,078
You're right. Kids might be precocious.

98
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,787
You handle his house. You handle him and his wife.

99
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:43,308
They get to just hang out and do nothing?

100
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,438
If you need help, you can take whoever you want.

101
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,893
- I'll take Taub. - I'll take Taub.

102
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:53,100
Interesting. <i>No, it's not.</i> It was a 50/50 choice.

103
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:54,712
<i>I'm totally fine</i> <i>with Taub or Park.</i>

104
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:57,847
Cool. I'll take Taub. And I'll take Park.

105
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:03,870
That was fun. Not really.

106
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,851
Nice move, boss.

107
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:13,082
Lying to the patient. I had no choice.

108
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,966
I knew House wouldn't take the case unless I ruled out anxiety.

109
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,690
You need a girlfriend. To keep me from lying to patients?

110
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:21,551
To give you the excitement you need so you don't go looking for it.

111
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:22,896
You're not working for House anymore,

112
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:25,590
which means you no longer have him to blame if you get caught.

113
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:26,787
I'm not looking for excitement.

114
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:30,078
I'm doing my job, part of which is to make sure House does his.

115
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:35,352
Girlfriend might not be so bad. It's less dangerous than where you're headed.

116
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:39,185
And that's from a guy with one alimony and two child support payments.

117
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,800
It's this new curve control thing.

118
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:58,173
It automatically slows the car when it senses I'm taking a curve too fast.

119
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,490
You really think I care about your car?

120
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:04,211
Or are you just trying to avoid talking about why you don't like working with me?

121
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:05,649
There's nothing to talk about.

122
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,662
House liked poking ant hills with a stick when he was a kid,

123
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:10,548
<i>and now he wants</i> <i>to do the same with us.</i>

124
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:15,081
House is an ass, but he's an intuitive ass. He obviously noticed something.

125
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:17,910
Yeah, the fact that we work well together.

126
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:21,548
He thrives on conflict and is looking for someone to torment.

127
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,547
Don't let it be us.

128
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,472
<i>I don't see</i> <i>how that's possible.</i>

129
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:31,295
Tommy's the most popular guy in his office.

130
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:35,922
He's even had defendants thank him after they were sentenced. Why would they thank him?

131
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,468
Because he doesn't treat them like scum.

132
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:41,094
He makes them feel like he's helping by offering a plea or even just by letting them

133
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,415
pay their debt and clear their conscience.

134
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,186
And even if someone wanted to poison him, I don't see how they would do it.

135
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:49,562
He never eats or drinks anything that we haven't made at home.

136
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:53,275
Wait. You mean literally? Like, not even a bottle of water?

137
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:54,417
No.

138
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:57,005
So he was obviously afraid of something.

139
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:59,958
Yeah, rats, mice, cockroaches.

140
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,425
My first job out of law school was at the health department.

141
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:06,887
If you'd have seen some of the kitchens or the processing plants I have,

142
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:08,859
you'd cook all your own food too.

143
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,818
<i>Poison wouldn't have</i> <i>to be in food.</i>

144
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,790
Have you gotten any strange letters or packages recently?

145
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:16,613
No.

146
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:18,948
You also wouldn't have to be at work.

147
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,687
We've got two young kids.

148
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:25,672
There's definitely no poisons I could have accidentally been exposed to at home.

149
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:29,158
What if it wasn't an accident?

150
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,695
How are things between you and your wife?

151
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:37,028
Are you asking me if I think my wife is trying to kill me?

152
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:40,190
Yes, I am.

153
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,076
Absolutely not.

154
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:45,872
This is coming from a man whose eyes are wide open.

155
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:48,400
I have prosecuted hundreds of despicable acts

156
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:51,268
by husbands, wives, parents.

157
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,474
I can assure you...

158
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:56,373
I love my husband, and I would not ever even for a second

159
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:58,860
consider doing anything to hurt him.

160
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:00,571
No pesticides,

161
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,409
fertilizers, or fuel in the garage.

162
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:04,774
You find anything?

163
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:08,180
No, there's not even a bottle of wite-out in this place.

164
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,575
Maybe we should look again.

165
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:12,285
Maybe we should leave before the police get here.

166
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:16,179
Well, even if a neighbor saw us break in and called 911, unless they said we were armed,

167
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,423
it's low priority. We've got another five minutes. <i>He's a prosecutor.</i>

168
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,404
Obviously he knows a lot of cops.

169
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:24,515
His house is not gonna be low priority.

170
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:26,529
Good point.

171
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:29,408
Wait.

172
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:33,893
The dining room's on the other side of that wall.

173
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,412
<i>Yeah, so?</i>

174
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:38,882
But it ends, like, three feet further over.

175
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:42,039
You've got to be kidding me. A second ago, you wanted to run like hell,

176
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,614
<i>and now you want</i> <i>to look for secret passages?</i>

177
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:50,963
There's a magnet on the fridge they use to open child-proofed cabinets.

178
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:52,459
Go get it.

179
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,340
Hurry up.

180
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,210
Here.

181
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:12,546
Holy crap.

182
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,760
Don't tell me.

183
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,338
The jealous wife in the dining room

184
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,192
with bipyridyl herbicide.

185
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:36,682
<i>We didn't find any poisons.</i>

186
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:42,164
Well, you obviously found something. Yeah.

187
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,130
A hidden bunker with enough guns to defend Fort Knox.

188
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,867
Or break into it.

189
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:52,141
Cool.

190
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,527
That's impossible. You must have broken into the wrong house.

191
00:10:56,528 --> 00:11:00,366
Then you have creepy neighbors, because there were photos of you and your kids all over.

192
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,115
I don't understand. <i>How could this...</i>

193
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:11,063
I had it put in during the remodel last year.

194
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:13,381
But we went over the plans together.

195
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,671
It's not in the plans.

196
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,256
I didn't want the city to know about it.

197
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,850
<i>I'm sorry.</i> I should have told you.

198
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,880
I just...

199
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,055
I didn't want you and the kids to worry.

200
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:27,647
About what?

201
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:32,861
Tommy, what is it? Why would you think you needed so many guns?

202
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,451
You're not gonna believe this.

203
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:45,614
<i>Imperio absenti chaos regit.</i>

204
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:50,442
He's worried that "too big to fail" applies to our banks but not our government.

205
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,466
How'd you know?

206
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:55,070
Because that's what every idiot with a bunker full of assault rifles is scared of.

207
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:57,079
Heather Sweeney.

208
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:01,416
Uh, it'll just be a couple of minutes till someone's ready to see you.

209
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:04,106
Maybe it's not stupidity. It's a symptom.

210
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,562
Cocaine abuse can cause paranoia and chest pain.

211
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:09,664
This isn't necessarily paranoia. Societies do fall apart.

212
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:11,400
Look what happened with London and the riots.

213
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,507
There's a difference between an isolated riot

214
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,241
<i>and the fall</i> <i>of civilization.</i>

215
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:19,502
April Donaldson. Sorry. Misspoke.

216
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:23,114
Imagine what would happen if there was a terrorist attack on the food supply

217
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:25,683
or a pandemic where we had to ration antibiotics.

218
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:28,268
- That's ridiculous. - Ouch.

219
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:32,207
Oh, shut up. We know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.

220
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,947
It was a little harsh.

221
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:38,147
Stop being so... What? Paranoid?

222
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:40,330
You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.

223
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,157
I think you're a good person and a fine doctor,

224
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:45,588
but it's ridiculous to think anyone needs an arsenal of assault weapons.

225
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,701
He's obviously paranoid. What about Fahr's disease?

226
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,617
He's not hallucinating. As far as we know.

227
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:52,874
We should do a mental status examination and get a CT of his basel ganglia.

228
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:53,781
<i>No, we shouldn't.</i>

229
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:56,182
If it's not poison, it's most likely atrial fibrillation

230
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:59,942
brought on by hyperthyroidism or sleep apnea.

231
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:04,752
Looks like we got ourselves a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight. No, we don't.

232
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:08,743
We have a reasoned disagreement. Still there's only one way to settle this.

233
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,851
Actually there's two, but we don't have enough jell-o for the first.

234
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:14,763
Mini-mental, CT, and get a hair sample

235
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,537
<i>to check</i> <i>for past cocaine use.</i>

236
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:19,643
Check his TSH levels and get a sleep study.

237
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:22,428
Sorry, we got to make it a fair fight, which means you're stuck with her.

238
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:24,163
He's not "stuck" with me.

239
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,945
And it's not a fight.

240
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,058
Uh, excuse me, miss,

241
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:33,373
what is your name? Mariel Wilkerson.

242
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,981
You don't look like a Mariel. You're up.

243
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:56,042
So what do you think-- is the patient paranoid or am I?

244
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,869
I don't think stockpiling weapons is the most reasoned response,

245
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,820
but, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's on Black Friday,

246
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,871
I wouldn't say it rises to the level of mental illness.

247
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:06,571
And me?

248
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:11,561
Again, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's...

249
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:15,307
Don't let House get to you. It's all of you.

250
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:18,676
I feel like you don't respect me. Chase certainly doesn't try to hide it.

251
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:20,332
Chase respects you. He's just more comfortable

252
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:24,124
working with me because he's known me longer.
And I'm not just saying that because you own a gun.

253
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,416
I don't own a gun.

254
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,732
I've thought about it, but I'd probably end up shooting

255
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:30,733
someone in my own family, like when my brother

256
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:33,714
tosses his toenail clippings behind the couch.

257
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,416
What about you?

258
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:39,801
If anarchy breaks out, I plan to do what my ancestors have done

259
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:42,687
throughout the ages--run.

260
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:44,461
<i>Sounds like a good plan.</i>

261
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:46,332
You got a moment?

262
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:52,186
Stop telling the nurses I'm looking for a girlfriend.

263
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:55,947
What makes you-- Two lunch offers and a box of cupcakes since this morning.

264
00:14:55,948 --> 00:15:00,608
So a few people are nice to you,
and your first thought is, "Hmm, this seems strange"?

265
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,623
I haven't even had enough time to eat my own lunch,

266
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:05,453
much less run around trying to recruit nurses for yours.

267
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:07,543
So can I get back to work?

268
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:12,418
You're lying, aren't you?

269
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,113
It's for his own good.

270
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:17,034
He's not paranoid. He's just stupid.

271
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:21,956
Well, shouldn't you put yourself in that group? You own a gun.

272
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:25,491
Our patient doesn't own a gun. He owns an arsenal.

273
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:28,125
And I don't own a gun.

274
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,138
Yes, you do.

275
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,178
And you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail--

276
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:34,610
That is actually not one of the many reasons

277
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:38,793
that I don't own a gun. Why would I need a gun?

278
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:42,207
The only thing I own worth protecting a thief would need a crane to get out of my apartment.

279
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,473
You don't own anything you need. You own things you want.

280
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:49,011
And you're definitely the type who'd want a gun.
You like anything dangerous--

281
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:53,175
monster trucks, motorcycles, fireworks. Everyone loves fireworks.

282
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:55,521
Watching them, not making them.

283
00:15:56,092 --> 00:16:00,125
I'm telling the truth.
I stand corrected.

284
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:07,106
If you believe me, then this issue will be resolved with no further action necessary.

285
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:10,306
Absolutely. It's not resolved, is it?

286
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:11,821
Not even close.

287
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,605
It's not cocaine. Hair samples were clean.

288
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,537
It's not looking good for Fahr's either.

289
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:22,427
I'm not seeing any calcifications. You sure?

290
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:25,005
They can be pretty hard to detect in people under 50.

291
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,450
- See? - What?

292
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:31,253
We all disagree all the time. It's not just me and Park.

293
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,608
Nice try, but I'm not getting in the middle.

294
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:38,925
So why didn't you want to go with her this morning? She's weird.

295
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:40,636
She's not weird. She's a good doctor.

296
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:43,420
Most good doctors are weird. Look at House.

297
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:48,153
Am I weird? Yeah, but you're hot, so it's easier to put up with.

298
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,377
You're completely normal and a pleasure to deal with.

299
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,631
You're weird. In a good way?

300
00:16:58,657 --> 00:17:01,180
Maybe we should just concentrate on the medicine.

301
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,308
You own any guns? That's not medicine.

302
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,129
But it's related to medicine. Kind of. What do you think?

303
00:17:09,924 --> 00:17:12,176
Yeah, but not for protection.

304
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:16,350
Despite what the media would have us believe, you think we live in a very safe world.

305
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,387
You just think they're fun.

306
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,997
How did you know?
Working in prison, you learned criminals

307
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:25,513
rarely target random strangers,
and you've got more money than you know what to do with,

308
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:28,669
so anything that seems different and fun's worth trying.

309
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,683
And you? Not here in the states.

310
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:35,913
Back home, I keep a few for hunting 'roos. You hunt kangaroos?

311
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:38,731
But they're so cute.

312
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:44,043
They're also delicious. You're screwing with me.

313
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:47,534
Totally. There's no calcification.

314
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:49,613
Looks like we're both wrong.

10315
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:51,769
You don't need to stay.

316
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,495
We won't have the results until the morning.
It's okay. I'll stay.

317
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,238
Go.

318
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:02,343
I'm sure your mother's ready for a break by now, huh?

319
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:04,650
<i>Give the kids</i> <i>a kiss for me.</i>

320
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,083
You think it's the end of the world, but you wanted kids.

321
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,558
Oh, honey, come on.

322
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,888
I don't think the world's coming to an end.

323
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,444
Look...

324
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,416
You have a spare tire in your car, right?

325
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,428
That's what those guns are.

326
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:30,790
I mean, I hope to God I never have to use one.

327
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:32,507
But if we can wake up

328
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:36,056
<i>and learn</i> <i>that the entire bank system</i> <i>has gone bankrupt overnight,</i>

329
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,165
it just seems stupid not to have a jack in the trunk.

330
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:42,247
<i>Just in case.</i>

331
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,290
And you've always--

332
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,252
What's that from? I don't know.

333
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,885
<i>You don't feel that?</i> No.

334
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:58,108
He also spiked a fever overnight. It could be TB.

335
00:18:58,856 --> 00:18:59,478
You want to say it.

336
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:03,198
- Say what? - There's no sign of atelectasis or infiltrates on the chest X-ray.

337
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,586
Yeah. It's med-speak for she's an idiot.

338
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:07,997
Systemic sclerosis can cause lower extremity ulcers.

339
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:11,374
It would have to be pretty far along because the first symptom was just a few days ago.

340
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:15,325
His paranoia started at least a year ago. If he's paranoid.

341
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,196
<i>So it's either not sclerosis</i> or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.

342
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:23,028
We should biopsy the skin lesion and start him on enoxaparin.

343
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:27,773
Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy results before we start treatment? Now's your chance.

344
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:31,784
<i>She's leading with her chin.</i> I agree with her.

345
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,945
No, you don't.

346
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,241
Which means you're both idiots.

347
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,818
<i>Get to work.</i>

348
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:45,632
I know you don't think I'm an idiot.

349
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:47,431
Does it matter?

350
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:51,204
If you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no.

351
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:55,654
But if you feel the need to manipulate me to make me feel useful, then yes.

352
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:59,635
I thought we'd gotten past that.
If we hadn't gotten past that, you wouldn't be here.

353
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,999
But ability isn't always enough.

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,425
Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.
So this is you trying to help me?

355
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:07,160
No, this is me helping me.

356
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:11,231
And amusing myself at your expense.
Which brings us back to, why do you care?

357
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:14,145
I deserve respect. I'm a good doctor.

358
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:18,216
People respect you. They just don't like you.

359
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,085
<i>Where's your wife?</i>

360
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:26,952
She just needed some time.

361
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:30,415
Not a fan of guns I take it.

362
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:34,522
It's not the guns. It's...

363
00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:37,030
I shouldn't have lied about it.

364
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:39,485
I'm guessing it's a little of both.

365
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,589
And a little of, "Who the hell is this guy?"

366
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,711
I'm not a nutcase.

367
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:51,274
<i>I just want to do</i> <i>everything I can</i> to protect my family.

368
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:54,893
Don't worry. I'm sure she understands.

369
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:00,896
At first, I thought it might be frostbite,

370
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:04,128
but I haven't really been out in the cold.

371
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,634
And yet your first thought was frostbite?

372
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,859
Yeah, I guess I was just going by how it looks.

373
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:14,023
It looks absolutely nothing like frostbite.

374
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,764
You serious?

375
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:18,989
With some difficulty. Then what is it?

376
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:22,036
A sign that you need to take a long vacation.

377
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:25,072
At least a month. A vacation?

378
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:29,046
Wait, is this like a bucket list thing?

379
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:31,596
It's cancer. It's silver.

380
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:34,331
I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly

381
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:39,720
that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.

382
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:45,407
Damn. Yeah, damn.

383
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:47,741
It's diffused into your skin,

384
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:51,170
and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin.

385
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:53,507
That normally happens every 30 days.

386
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:57,792
So I hear that La Crosse, Wisconsin has got

387
00:21:57,793 --> 00:22:00,561
the world's largest beer can.

388
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,928
Here's the per diem schedules. These are supposed to be in the computer files.

389
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:10,106
Sorry. Since Claudine left, no one's been inputting the numbers.

390
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:11,760
I miss Claudine.

391
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:15,044
She left because of you. I thought that was Nadine.

392
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:16,557
- Her too. - Where are you going?

393
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:18,091
You still have an hour left.

394
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:20,490
Emergency page takes precedence.

395
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,397
- Can you-- - I don't know how to use the program.

396
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:26,611
Then find someone who does. I got to get out of here.

397
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:40,415
Got your page. You're an ass.

398
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,650
Admit it.

399
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,333
Let me down.

400
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,275
After you admit it.

401
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:55,011
You know, I'm a little tired. I think I'm gonna-- all right, I admit it.

402
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:58,792
Despite the fact that I know there's a gun in here, I'd never find it

403
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,777
because you are more devious--

404
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:04,003
- Clever. - Devious.

405
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:06,965
All right, fine, clever.

406
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:11,211
More clever and you'll always be one step ahead of me.

407
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:31,167
You're either preparing to fight Pacquiao

408
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:33,629
or you're having one heck of a bad day.

409
00:23:35,157 --> 00:23:38,163
- I'm Anita. - Eric.

410
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:39,865
Nice to meet you.

411
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:43,978
And you can tell Taub that he's gonna get the same treatment

412
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:46,435
as this heavy bag if he doesn't cut this crap out.

413
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:47,836
Who's Taub?

414
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:51,202
You know, I'm sure you're a nice person

415
00:23:51,203 --> 00:23:56,585
and you have no idea what you've gotten sucked into, but, really, I'm not interested.

416
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:58,931
Okay, and I'm sure you're a nice person,

417
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:02,200
but I just moved from Atlanta, and it's my first time at this gym,

418
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:05,136
so definitely don't know who this Taub guy is,

419
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:07,665
but I already agree. He's a jerk.

420
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,661
Are you sure you don't want to start over?

421
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,718
Take your time.

422
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,498
I'll be around.

423
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,552
Taub, it's Foreman.

424
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:30,790
Hey, can't talk now. Little busy. What's going on?

425
00:24:34,282 --> 00:24:36,642
Need some droperidol in here! I gotta go!

426
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:42,378
He was hallucinating he was being attacked by bears.

427
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,938
Points again to paranoia. I agree.

428
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:48,451
Except for the "again". Acute onset points to tularemia.

429
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:51,311
Or it's been chronic, which points to GAD autoimmunity.

430
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:53,772
<i>Explains</i> <i>the neurological impairment</i> as well as the normal blood work.

431
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:55,785
Tularemia doesn't always show up
in blood work either.

432
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,122
<i>You know what else</i> <i>doesn't show up</i> <i>in the blood work?</i>

433
00:24:58,181 --> 00:25:00,797
Nothing. This could be all psychiatric.

434
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,253
<i>An untreated schizoid disorder</i> <i>he's finally lost</i> <i>the ability to suppress.</i>

435
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,859
Schizophrenia doesn't cause skin ulcers or fevers.

436
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,843
No, but digging delusions out of your skin with dirty fingernails could cause both.

437
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:14,157
I don't think he's a psych case. Because you're paranoid about paranoia.

438
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:17,997
<i>Because his symptoms</i> point towards an infection that spread to his brain.

439
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:20,031
I think we should treat with high-dose, broad-spectrum--

440
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:23,210
which will kill him if it's a GAD autoimmunity.

441
00:25:28,547 --> 00:25:30,430
Treat for GAD.

442
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:33,778
Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin.

443
00:25:40,362 --> 00:25:42,724
I'm not paranoid. And they don't dislike me.

444
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:45,981
They don't even really know me. They tell you that?

445
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:48,895
I didn't ask because you wouldn't believe the answer.

446
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,252
If it makes you feel better to think that.

447
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:53,586
You're the one everyone dislikes.

448
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:55,300
You probably don't even think it's GAD.

449
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:59,009
You're just agreeing with her because you think it'll create more conflict between us.

450
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,990
There's only one way to find out.

451
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:02,181
Actually, there's two.

452
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:04,502
We're still waiting for that jell-o delivery.

453
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:06,111
Let me know how it goes.

454
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:02,504
Gotcha!

455
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:07,447
You poor dumb bastard.

456
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:58,602
Touche.

457
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,049
God, this is exactly what I needed.

458
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,668
Tell me about it.

459
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:25,693
<i>Anita.</i> Oh, my God. Who is that, your roommate?

460
00:28:25,694 --> 00:28:28,243
It's just you have to go. Wait a minute, what's the big deal?

461
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:31,520
Please. I'll explain later. Just hurry up. Please.

462
00:28:31,664 --> 00:28:34,610
You have a boyfriend? No, he's not my boyfriend.

463
00:28:36,027 --> 00:28:39,203
He's my husband. I'm really sorry.

464
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,232
<i>Hey! I thought you weren't</i> <i>getting back till tomorrow.</i>

465
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:54,663
His fever's going through the roof, which means we were wrong about GAD

466
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:56,763
and the steroids kicked the infection into high gear.

467
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:58,814
Or it's GAD, and we started treatment too late.

468
00:28:58,815 --> 00:29:01,286
- Increase the steroid dose. - We can't.

469
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:03,200
If it's an infection, we'll kill him for sure.

470
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:07,608
With neurological symptoms progressing this fast, he's dead either way.

471
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:10,683
If we increase the steroids, then either death comes slower,

472
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:13,962
which means we were too late with the GAD, or death comes faster,

473
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:16,644
which means we were too stupid with the infection.

474
00:29:16,645 --> 00:29:19,732
We were already stupid with the infection, but it's not too late.

475
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:22,511
He's young, and he was perfectly healthy two days ago.

476
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:25,454
He can fight this off if we give him a chance.

477
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:30,100
Fine.

478
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,178
But a shotgun is not gonna work. We need a sniper rifle.

479
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,821
Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia,

480
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:39,920
and any other boggle-winning words you can think of.

481
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:44,024
You just said you wanted to increase the steroids, and now you want to just-- - I changed my mind.

482
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,274
- But-- Do what Park says.

483
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,881
Well, you don't have a gun,

484
00:29:57,885 --> 00:30:00,642
but you do have my sunglasses,

485
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:05,009
my tennis racket-- I can't imagine why-- Had to kill a mouse.

486
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,517
It was really hard with those stupid little sunglasses.

487
00:30:08,212 --> 00:30:09,933
And my money clip.

488
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:13,285
<i>Was there any money in it?</i> Not anymore.

489
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:16,525
Can I go to bed now? Or do you want to do a cavity search?

490
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:20,840
Lock up on your way out. This is ridiculous.

491
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:24,043
Every moment we waste looking for a phantom infection is time we could be treating him.

492
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:27,178
<i>For the wrong diagnosis.</i> If it was GAD, he'd be having seizures.

493
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,591
<i>If it was infection,</i> there would be some sign of it in his blood or CNS.

494
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:32,344
- Which there isn't. - Yet.

495
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:34,915
I'm beginning to think we should just go with House's idea.

496
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,452
This was House's idea. He said-- no, I'm talking about the jell-o.

497
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:40,781
<i>At least it wouldn't be</i> <i>so annoying to watch.</i>

498
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,355
Taub, you got a minute?

499
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:49,843
You're an ass. You know that? What's the problem?

500
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:52,825
Some cute young nurse baked you cookies?

501
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:56,850
No, some guy almost caught me making out with his wife in their living room.

502
00:30:57,364 --> 00:30:59,644
And how exactly is that my fault?

503
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:01,485
If you hadn't been screwing with me and put the idea in my head...

504
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,304
So you don't date anyone unless I put the idea in your head.

505
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:06,536
You really do need psychiatric help.

506
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:09,495
Unlike you, I don't need drama.

507
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:12,032
I like my job, and I'm happy with my life.

508
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:14,766
You're so happy with your life you've got nothing better to do at midnight

509
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,158
than to come back into work to yell at me?

510
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:21,158
Stay out of my business.

511
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:25,993
You're blaming the wrong guy.

512
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:30,785
Good for him.

513
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:36,318
Married one's not a keeper, but it's a start.

514
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:38,526
You're an idiot.

10515
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:51,858
He has stridor but no obstruction. He's anaphylaxing. Get me a trach kit.

516
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,631
Scalpel.

517
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:22,633
It's not working. There's no breath sounds. It doesn't make any sense.

518
00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:24,082
His trachea's blocked below the incision point.

519
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,228
We need racemic epinephrine. <i>We tried that already.</i>

520
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:28,447
We're gonna try again. It's our only choice.

521
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:35,513
We got him breathing, but barely.

522
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:39,399
At least we know tracheal edema isn't from anything we did

523
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,953
because we're not doing anything.

524
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:45,031
<i>Which is a good thing,</i> <i>because neither GAD</i> <i>nor systemic infection</i> <i>would cause anaphylaxis</i>

525
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:46,157
or tracheal edema.

526
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:49,906
And an allergic reaction wouldn't get worse three days after he was admitted.

527
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,391
So we've got nothing.

528
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:55,797
Unless he was still being poisoned.

529
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:56,774
<i>By who?</i>

530
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:59,346
His wife wasn't even here when he hallucinated.

531
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:04,485
Good question. Now we're the ones being paranoid.

532
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:08,715
What about squamous cell carcinoma?

533
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:12,675
<i>If it's only in his epithelium,</i> it wouldn't show up in his chest X-ray.

534
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:14,379
It is possible, but...

535
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,636
Wouldn't cause hallucinations. It could if you also have paraneoplastic syndrome.

536
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:26,601
Get a biopsy. You think it's cancer?

537
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,448
I think you should get a biopsy.

538
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:41,748
Admit it.

539
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:51,267
<i>Two hours ago,</i> <i>I found this in your closet</i> in a box with your name on it.

540
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:54,046
I knew you'd move it somewhere outside your apartment

541
00:33:54,047 --> 00:33:56,727
until you were certain I'd given up looking.

542
00:33:56,728 --> 00:34:00,627
So I had to convince you that I'd given up looking.

543
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:03,410
That's not a gun.

544
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:11,421
Yes, it's a paperweight with a handy storage compartment

545
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:14,195
for .45-caliber bullets.

546
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:17,952
- And that's not a bullet. - Admit it.

547
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:21,289
I'm more clever and more devious. You can even have it back.

548
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,914
It's not my problem if you go back to prison.

549
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:26,308
My problem is you thinking you're always one step ahead of me.

550
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:30,218
This proves nothing because it's not a gun. It's a prop.

551
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,050
From Dorothy Dietrich's magic act.

552
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,576
<i>Look it up.</i>

553
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:36,894
She's the only woman to ever do the "catch a bullet" trick.

554
00:34:36,895 --> 00:34:40,413
I won this off her prop master in a poker game.

555
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:42,968
House-- it's fake.

556
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:48,844
It's plugged. Look for yourself.

557
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:51,011
Hey, hey, don't point that thing at me.

558
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:55,495
It's not dangerous because it's not a gun.
House, House, just stop it.

559
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:57,644
Fine.

560
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:05,255
What the hell are you doing? Pull the trigger. Don't be insane.

561
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:06,518
They're blanks.

562
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:09,933
You pull the trigger, I drool a little fake blood,

563
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,846
and then I spit out the bullet that the audience thinks

564
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:15,113
I caught in my teeth. Go ahead. Shoot me.

565
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,783
I'm not shooting you. All right. I'll shoot you.

566
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,618
Don't. House, don't.

567
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:24,176
Even if they are blanks, people'll freak.

568
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,968
It's not real.

569
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:31,688
Which means you didn't prove that I have a gun.

570
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:33,439
Which means you proved nothing.

571
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:37,253
Admit it.

572
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:46,168
<i>Admit it.</i>

573
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,647
- All right. - All right, what?

574
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:58,214
You win. And it feels good.

575
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:01,860
Grr.

576
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:33,884
You were wrong. Don't feel too bad.

577
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:37,538
We all were. His trachea wasn't swollen.

578
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:40,521
It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing across it.

579
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:43,195
It means he's not paranoid, is an idiot,

580
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:45,012
and was poisoned.

581
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,396
What are you doing? Give me a machida scope.

582
00:36:50,782 --> 00:36:52,994
Hold his legs. He's not gonna like this.

583
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:56,094
Because you're not gonna be able to breathe.

584
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,738
But I need to see down your barrel.

585
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,295
The good news is the poison didn't come from your wife.

586
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:14,661
It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain,

587
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:17,597
respiratory distress, skin ulcers,

588
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:20,195
the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway,

589
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:25,123
and, in very rare cases, hallucinations.

590
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:33,750
Call the CDC.

591
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,131
<i>Tell them we need antitoxin</i> <i>as soon as possible.</i>

592
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:37,284
Diphtheria?

593
00:37:37,285 --> 00:37:39,893
<i>We didn't guess it</i> because nobody gets it.

594
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:43,847
<i>Instead of building bunkers,</i> you should be getting boosters.

595
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:48,132
As in routine vaccines against stuff that is actually scary.

596
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:01,332
<i>Dr. Wills to recovery.</i> <i>Dr. Wills to recovery.</i>

597
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:05,495
Diphtheria.

598
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:08,635
House pulled it out of nowhere.

599
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,969
Cool.

600
00:38:12,286 --> 00:38:13,885
You just getting in?

601
00:38:14,102 --> 00:38:17,435
Had a meeting about a new parking validation system.

602
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,268
Cool.

603
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,039
How are you feeling?

604
00:38:24,366 --> 00:38:25,936
Not great.

605
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:30,168
But better.

606
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:34,401
The antitoxin is working.

607
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:36,554
He'll be able to go home in a few days.

608
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:38,757
That's good news.

609
00:38:39,702 --> 00:38:41,376
But we've moved out.

610
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:47,233
Oh, come on, honey. I'm sorry I lied, but--

611
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:49,037
I know, okay.

612
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:51,564
It was for our own good, but I don't care.

613
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:54,733
I don't want to be lied to, and I can't live like that.

614
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:56,479
I can't live in that home.

615
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:01,096
Oh, please don't.

616
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,386
I love you.

617
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:08,038
I love you too.

618
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,708
Which is why you're not gonna live there either.

619
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,846
I don't care if we might need them.

620
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:17,330
I just know that I can't live my life feeling like we do.

621
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:20,046
It's not worth living in fear.

622
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:24,720
Okay.

623
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,832
I'm sorry.

624
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:45,695
Thanks.

625
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:47,965
* Can't take me down *

626
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:52,235
You know, there's a bunch of us going to happy hour after work.

627
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:56,839
I'm craving nachos. You interested?

628
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,482
Thanks, but I got a lot of work I need to get done.

629
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:03,405
Sure. Well, if you change your mind, we'll be at Rudy's.

630
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:05,042
Okay.

631
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,784
Hey. 

632
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:31,532
Would you like to get a drink sometime after work?

633
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:35,393
You mean all of us or just us?

634
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,944
I was thinking just the two of us.

635
00:40:39,685 --> 00:40:41,061
Did Taub put you up to this?

636
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:43,953
No, it was just something I'd been thinking about

637
00:40:43,954 --> 00:40:45,753
and I figured, what the heck?

638
00:40:45,754 --> 00:40:47,640
Might as well ask.

639
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:51,839
Yeah, well, it's probably not a good idea,

640
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,610
you know, with us working together.

641
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:57,960
Didn't you marry someone you used to work with?

642
00:40:58,354 --> 00:41:00,509
Yeah. But...

643
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:04,565
All right. Sure.

644
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,910
When? Tonight?

645
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:08,323
Sure.

646
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,567
Hey.

647
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:40,179
Changed my mind. Okay.

648
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,507
<i>I'm glad you changed</i> <i>your mind.</i>

649
00:42:45,197 --> 00:42:56,446
