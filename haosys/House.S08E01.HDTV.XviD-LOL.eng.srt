1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,050
You've been good...

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,480
...ish..behavior.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,810
In 8 of 12 months time served we have the discretion to

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,670
grant parole, Friday the 10th, five days from now.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,380
Are you sorry about what you did?

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,590
Yes.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,510
Yes?

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,480
That's the correct answer, isn't it?

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,399
Are you trying to annoy us?

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,819
<i>No, I'm just trying</i> <i>to give you</i> the answers you need to cover your asses,

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,490
fill out your forms, and let me out of here.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,820
We need you to show us remorse.

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,450
Is that how our system works?

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,969
<i>Release the best actors?</i>

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,579
I shudder to think what that world would be like.

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,929
<i>You drove your car into</i> <i>your ex-girlfriend's house</i>

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,920
and then fled the country for three months.

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,510
I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like every Friday,

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,100
and I saw everyone else move into the living room.
They could've moved back.

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,829
Which I would've noticed since I was driving right towards them.

21
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,510
Shut up. We got an order to reduce overcrowding.

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,409
But let me be clear-- you mouth off to one guard,

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,059
we catch you with a single cafeteria tray in your cell,

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,110
you break any rules I don't even remember,

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,360
you can park your ass here for four more months.

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,879
So forget being sorry.

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,100
Can you stay out of trouble for five days?

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,690
Yes.

monday

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,290
Get in line for meds! Asofa!

34
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,410
Why you keep helping him out?

35
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,509
Yeah, why would I wanna make sure

36
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,989
that my homicidal cellmate

37
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,930
is taking the right anti-psychotics?

38
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,310
House!

39
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,250
Mendelson!

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,810
He's on 80 mg of Propranolol. That's 40.

41
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,129
You're right. Sorry.
No worries.

42
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,970
I like my nurses naughty.

43
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,300
I'm starting to think, Mendelson,

44
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,940
that you just really like the taste of my spit.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,360
Hey, House.

46
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,770
Check out our new brand, huh?

47
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,650
You really got a thing for swastikas, Mendelson.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,760
Like an ironic thing? It's a German name.

49
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,930
So is "House." I'm Jewish.

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,770
Nah, I'm a black, gay gypsy.

51
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,340
Knight to King's Bishop three.

52
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,410
Queen to King's Bishop seven.

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,340
You're House, right?

54
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,339
I got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees--

55
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,290
You know, what's weirder is how the clinic is a large room

56
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,070
and you somehow confused me with it.

57
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,080
Although, to be fair, I <i>am</i> large.

58
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,670
Hi, Rollo.

59
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,539
I realize this is probably a rhetorical question--
why are you stealing my stuff?

60
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,940
Hey, House. I heard you're on short time.

61
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,340
You won't need this.

62
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,740
You heard about my parole,

63
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,010
but not about my violent reactions when people steal my tuna.

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,000
Put it back.

65
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,250
Nuh-uh.

66
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,240
Really?

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,210
You're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds,

68
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,919
and he was carrying a cane, which,

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,419
while prison-approved, would still cause some issues

70
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,150
if inserted into your colon.

71
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,430
Yeah, like you losing your parole.

72
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,289
And you ain't gonna rat me out neither, 'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket

73
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,840
and wind up shanked in the showers.

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,020
So you're just gonna let me walk out of here.

75
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,130
You wanna get back at these guys...

76
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,430
Get out alive on Friday.

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,390
All right, now go to work, House.

78
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,880
Oh, and that was Checkmate, right? <i>Yep.</i>

79
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,940
I heard you're on that short time, House?

80
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,240
If you like tuna, you're a little late.

81
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,600
I want your stereo and your headphones.

82
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,340
It can wait till you finish your work.

83
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,170
Drop it off in my cell.

84
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,210
99.9.

85
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,610
I'm gonna start him on ceftriaxone.

86
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,730
Good catch. I might've missed that.

87
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,700
It's not gonorrhea.

88
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,040
I didn't say it was.

89
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,009
Not out loud,
but you're figuring that joint pain,

90
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,069
plus fever, plus a low lifestyle

91
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,070
equals a ceftriaxone prescription.

92
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,519
<i>So you're saying</i> <i>I got the clap?</i>

93
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,090
I've only been in here one week. My girlfriend's clean.

94
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,380
I ain't got a girlfriend in here.

95
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,730
How do you know about ceftriaxone?

96
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,730
House used to be a doctor.

97
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,760
Not going back,

98
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,890
and that look of shock is elitist and offensive.

99
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,800
Doctors can be degenerates. This is America.

100
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,600
There's subtle eyebrow loss. <i>It's lupus.</i>

101
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,249
Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.

102
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,600
Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.

103
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,779
<i>He's got a point,</i> but I'll let you make the call.

104
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,189
No, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash

105
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,540
since lupus doesn't usually present that way. "Usually"?

106
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,570
Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work.

107
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,200
You don't write people up for mouthing off, do you?

108
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,360
Not usually.

109
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,500
You don't wanna mess with Stomper.

110
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,879
He didn't get that name

111
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,940
because he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,119
You think one of Santa's reindeer was called Stomper?

113
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,389
You're missing my point.
I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.

114
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,990
Well, you saw what happened in the yard with Diaz.

115
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,270
<i>He barely said</i> <i>a couple of words</i>
<i>and set the boy off.</i>

116
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,700
<i>Oh, no.</i>

117
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,720
I know that look.

118
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,270
Hey, Stomper. Where's my stereo?

119
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,809
I brought it to your cell. It ain't there.

120
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,220
<i>I was just getting</i> <i>to that part.</i>

121
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,470
Rollo followed me in and took it.

122
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,719
No way Rollo'd diss me like that.

123
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,549
Way. I don't wanna start any rumors, but--

124
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,490
But what?

125
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,179
Well, he was all, you know, "I could take Stomper."

126
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,899
<i>And I was all,</i> <i>"how come?"</i>

127
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,140
<i>And he was all,</i> <i>"'cause of how Diaz</i>
kicked his ass last month."

128
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,899
<i>In fact, he actually</i> <i>called you "Stompee,"</i>

129
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,060
<i>with an "ee."</i>

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,820
I think his gist was...

131
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,629
<i>You took my stereo?</i> <i>Get out of</i> <i>my House, Stomper.</i>

132
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,950
<i>I ain't got</i> <i>no stereo.</i>

133
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,540
<i>Well,</i> <i>then what's this, then?</i>

134
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,290
<i>What? I didn't</i> <i>put that there!</i>

135
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,630
<i>You're gonna lie to my face,</i> <i>you lying son of a bitch!</i>

136
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,250
<i>What? I didn't do</i> <i>anything!</i>

137
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,650
<i>Next time I</i> will <i>take your stereo!</i>

138
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,480
That was stupid.

139
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,970
<i>Is that, like,</i> <i>a synonym for "clever"?</i>

140
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,119
<i>By the time they</i> <i>get out of solitary,</i>

141
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,640
I'll be teaching physics at the University of Fiji.

142
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,670
You have four days left.

143
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,680
How many more tricks do you got?

144
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,000
Tuesday

145
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,120
Don't.

146
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,740
This another pet?

147
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,750
'Cause it's gonna end badly.

148
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,520
Again.

149
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,019
<i>Remember we talked</i> <i>about this?</i>

150
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,630
<i>At least I talked,</i> <i>and you stared at me eerily.</i>

151
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,390
I think it was eerily. "Eerily" felt like the best-case scenario.

152
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,110
<i>Take off your shirt</i> <i>so I can find the rash.</i>

153
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,370
Oh, now you wanna help me.

154
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,880
'Cause that doctor didn't believe you?

155
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,120
<i>Well, if you can think</i> <i>of a better way</i>

156
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,810
to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears.

157
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,890
<i>Now, let's get this</i> <i>over with.</i>
Yeah.

158
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,770
That's Nicole.

159
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,680
She lives at her mom's now on account that she lost her job.

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,140
Her mom hates me, so she can't visit,

161
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,460
she ain't accepting my calls.

162
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,410
Well, that's what happens when you date a 12-year-old.

163
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,520
You don't believe me?

164
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,320
Belief implies a level of giving a crap

165
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,120
that I am never gonna achieve.

166
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,660
Pull down your pants.

167
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,819
<i>It's not that I</i> <i>was trying to prove</i>

168
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,230
that you're an idiot or anything,

169
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,280
but lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning,

170
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,700
<i>and I noticed a rash</i> <i>on his left thigh.</i>

171
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,670
I checked you out.

172
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,410
<i>You were</i> <i>a pretty big deal.</i>

173
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,130
What went wrong?

174
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,750
Something very obvious and very boring.

175
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,760
Drug related?

176
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,740
Forging prescriptions?

177
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,589
Oh, you're good, <i>just like</i> <i>lupus boy will be</i>

178
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,200
<i>when you start him</i> <i>on prednisone.</i>

179
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,040
Name should've been a giveaway. I'll send him up.

180
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,190
Why are you so sure I'm gonna do what you say?

181
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,639
Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl

182
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,979
who took this job because your liberal ideology

183
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,539
makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored,

184
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,810
and this is interesting.

185
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Why would you say any of that?

186
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,400
Your shoes--

187
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,340
<i>a different,</i> <i>expensive pair every day,</i>

188
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,289
<i>but never leather,</i>

189
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,289
<i>which means you're both</i> <i>rich</i> and <i>liberal.</i>

190
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,509
Antique locket-- it's unpolished gold. Not some hipster thing.

191
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,329
<i>It's a family heirloom,</i> <i>which means old money.</i>

192
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,969
Osler scarf-- only on Fridays,

193
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,289
<i>which means you did</i> <i>your residency at Hopkins,</i>

194
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,780
which means you're smarter than our interactions
would so far indicate.

195
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,460
And your eyes--

196
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,089
<i>the only time</i> <i>you haven't looked bored</i>
<i>in the three months</i> <i>since you've been here</i>

197
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,290
is when we've been discussing this diagnosis.

198
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,820
So, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus.

199
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,700
House.

200
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,180
He wants you.

201
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,870
<i>Parole?</i>

202
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,630
You didn't tell me.

203
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,040
I didn't want a big, emotional scene.

204
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,630
But you know what the rules are.

205
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,520
On short time, tax goes up.

206
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,260
How many do you want?

207
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,620
All of 'em.

208
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,439
Come on, Mendelson. I should be on six a day.

209
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,170
<i>I get four,</i> <i>and I give you two.</i>

210
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,109
Fine. Get one in my cell after lights-out.

211
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,060
Plus Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

212
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,320
<i>that's 11 in all.</i>

213
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,540
I count 20.

214
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,090
<i>You knew on Monday,</i> <i>you get out Friday.</i>
Five days.

215
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,960
<i>You should've told me</i> <i>earlier.</i>

216
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,070
They give out four a day, Max.

217
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,609
You'll figure something out.
<i>You're a creative guy.</i>

218
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,540
What if I just go into protective custody,

219
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,500
spend the next three days in the hole?

220
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,700
Oh, you could P.C. up.

221
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,850
But then you'll get out,

222
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,740
<i>and unlike you...</i>

223
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,420
<i>I got friends</i> <i>on the outside.</i>

224
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,810
Porter.

225
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,360
Doc, what ya need?

226
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,550
I'm running a special on grilled cheese this week.

227
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,750
Got some new girly mags too.
I was thinking of something more...

228
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,060
Vicodin-y.

229
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,070
At least 16, and I need them Friday at noon.

230
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,250
Ooh, I mean, that's pricy,

231
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,460
but it can be done.

232
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,869
How about you have one of your peeps on the outside

233
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,900
send $200 to my boy up in Trenton?

234
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,880
I am peep-less.

235
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,050
This is just you haggling, right?

236
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,989
No. You ever see me chatting on the phone,

237
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,010
taking visitors?

238
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,349
All right, but I'm gonna have to clean you out.

239
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,509
I'm gonna need to see some tuna.

240
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,389
I'm gonna need to see some stamps, uh, stereo--

241
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,990
just get 'em to me as soon as you can.

242
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,519
What happened? I was trying to use the phone.

243
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,820
I just--I just got jostled a little, that's it.

244
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,250
Who hit you?

245
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,860
I just--I just bumped into the wall.

246
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,780
That's not lupus.

247
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,270
Is that good?

248
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,470
Does it feel good?

249
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,140
wednesday

250
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,730
<i>Sick.</i>

251
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,750
<i>No, I'm just going through</i> <i>a bit of withdrawal.</i>

252
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,649
I'm trying to survive on one a day

253
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,940
for the next few days.

254
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,410
<i>No.</i>

255
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,300
Fix him.

256
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,960
It's not lupus. He broke his arm.

257
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,669
Or it <i>is</i> lupus, and he was in a fight.

258
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,109
He was in a jostle. 'Cause if he admits he was in a fight,

259
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,599
then he goes to the hole. That's why he'd lie to the guards.

260
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,060
He's got no reason to lie to me.

261
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,140
See? There are those eyes again.

262
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,099
<i>How about</i> <i>a viral syndrome?</i>

263
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,960
Or MRSA?

264
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,409
No, that wouldn't chew up the bone that fast.

265
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,890
<i>But reaction</i> <i>to meds could.</i>

266
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,349
- May I? - May you what?

267
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,050
Make me lose my job by showing you a patient file?

268
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,389
But why don't you assume no recent meds?

269
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,059
<i>How long can I assume</i> <i>that he's been smoking?</i>

270
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,769
Based on his yellow fingers.

271
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,230
You're thinking lung cancer.

272
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,610
Metastatic. I'll X-ray him on Friday.

273
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,609
We share a traveling X-ray machine two other clinics.

274
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,370
I'm out of here on Friday. He's not.

275
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,640
Well, how about...

276
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,380
If he throws a clot and strokes out,
you can use the X-ray to do the autopsy.

277
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,179
<i>Start him</i> <i>on blood thinners.</i>
Very interesting practice you must've run.

278
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,310
No need for tests. No need for proof.

279
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,560
<i>Where are you going?</i> To the proof store.

280
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,970
You were right about Nicole.

281
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,960
About me not caring? I thought so.

282
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,660
It wasn't her mom. It was her.

283
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,610
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

284
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,260
Listen, I'm trying to listen to your lungs, not your self-pity.

285
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,190
Cancer can wait.
Hey, heading out to the yard?

286
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,460
You mind trying to find me a cricket?

287
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,590
The ol' swap trick?

288
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,129
You don't think that will piss off your cellie even more

289
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,799
when he figures it's a different bug?

290
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,300
I'll dress 'em the same, like in <i>Vertigo.</i>

291
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,460
Well, I'll try, but they spray so much pesticide

292
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm surprised we're alive.

293
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,290
Good point.

294
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,840
Hey. How's it coming? It ain't.

295
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,309
The confederates be giving themselves spankin' new tats.

296
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,050
They putting a claim on all of my Vicodin.

297
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,719
Now, I love you and all, my brother, but not as much as I love my gang

298
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,300
of crazy, roided-out Nazi bitches.

299
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,720
<i>Turn to an inch</i> <i>to the left.</i>

300
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,740
<i>Hear</i> <i>the difference?</i>

301
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,209
Yeah!

302
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,760
It's called an acoustical shadow.

303
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,709
<i>It means</i> <i>he's got a tumor.</i>
How did you find that without a stethoscope?

304
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,179
I didn't even know you could do this!

305
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,920
Start the blood thinners. So I for sure got lung cancer?

306
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,060
- No. - Yeah.

307
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,009
<i>All you've proven</i> is there's an anomaly in his chest.

308
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,319
Which means your initial diagnosis could still be right.

309
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,830
Which apparently really bugs you.

310
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,820
I could do a clotting test.

311
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,420
That's...

312
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,859
That's a good idea.

313
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,419
<i>We're just gonna cut</i> <i>your earlobe a bit</i>

314
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,149
<i>and check back</i> <i>in two minutes.</i>

315
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,710
If there's a little blood bubbling up, that's normal.

316
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,990
But if it's completely clotted,

317
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,760
it may indicate cancer.

318
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,280
Okay? Ready?

319
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,910
Are you really leaving medicine?

320
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,660
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

321
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,690
You know, for someone

322
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,359
who asks as many favors as you do,

323
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,380
you sure don't make any effort to win me over.

324
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,820
Before I went to med school,

325
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,470
I thought about getting a Ph.D. in physics.

326
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,670
You ever heard of dark matter?

327
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,070
<i>The way galaxies rotate,</i> <i>the motion of the Universe,</i>

328
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,710
it means there's six times more stuff than we can detect.

329
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,149
But it's theorized.

330
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,900
No one's ever proved it exists.

331
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,620
So you wanna research it?

332
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,010
<i>Why?</i> It's the greatest mystery there is--

333
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,350
the theory of everything.

334
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,130
And completely divorced from humanity.

335
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,760
Well, me and humanity, we got together too young.

336
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,830
Tsk. You have a gift.

337
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,589
<i>There is something</i> <i>in this world</i>

338
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,200
you are undeniably great at.

339
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,749
<i>You can read people.</i>

340
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,850
<i>You--</i> <i>you understand them.</i>

341
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,120
You gotta go back to medicine.

342
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,550
Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here,

343
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,360
you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy.

344
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,130
Is this supposed to happen?

345
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,680
Cool.

346
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,940
thursday

347
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,990
Jiminy didn't chirp much last night.

348
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,240
If it's a disease, then he's six inches under.

349
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,920
But this could also be pesticide poisoning...

350
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,930
Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat.

351
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,890
See?

352
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,490
Just so much and no more.

353
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,300
This is where you say "thank you."

354
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,000
Or I say thank you

355
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,330
for not killing me.

356
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,020
Thank you.

357
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,800
The X-ray didn't show any tumors.

358
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,099
The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma.

359
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,690
I'm thinking-- you all right?

360
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm fine. Ibuprofen?

361
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
That's not gonna help.

362
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,210
You can look at the patient file if you want.

363
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,410
You trust me?

364
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,070
Any reason I shouldn't?

365
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,890
You're really not good at reading people, are you?

366
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,330
Or buildings. People are complicated.

367
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,419
And people change.

368
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,290
Not that much to the first, and not at all to the second.

369
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,920
But if it'll get me the file...

370
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,899
If we add "clotting disorder" to the symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin.

371
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,539
This guy's the only one with symptoms.

372
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,359
It's either gotta be his cell or his work station.
The laundry room.

373
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,119
So maybe a solvent or detergent?

374
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,770
Can you get me an escort to gather samples?

375
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,600
Dr. Adams.

376
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,390
<i>Why does he</i> <i>have a file?</i>

377
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,799
You need to get cotton swabs-- <i>but not now.</i>

378
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,940
I got something to do.

379
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,450
You're a prisoner on tier time.
<i>By definition,</i> <i>you have nothing to do.</i>

380
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,619
Call her family, her friends, her work.
<i>I'm gonna get through</i> <i>eventually.</i>

381
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,289
You're moving slower. You're getting weaker.

382
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,909
<i>This thing's attacking</i> <i>your bones, your joints,</i>
<i>your blood.</i>

383
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,450
Look, my girl's more important.

384
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,180
She's not your girl, you idiot.

385
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,829
<i>She</i> was <i>the girlfriend</i> <i>of a loser drug dealer.</i>

386
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,530
Think she's got the self-control to wait around for three years?

387
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,420
You think she should?

388
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,390
<i>There's a reason</i> <i>we're locked away</i>
from nice, normal people.

389
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,120
Your life outside is over.

390
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,499
Your friends, your girl, everyone you worked with,

391
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,470
they've moved on.

392
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,260
Get out of my house.

393
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,010
Get out!

394
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,439
Where's Sykes?

395
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,890
<i>Off at his other clinics.</i>

396
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,070
Great. Well, I'm gonna go through the laundry.

397
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,740
<i>Give me some swabs.</i> No.

398
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,050
What? He yelled at you for letting me see the file?

399
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,120
<i>You'll get over it.</i>

400
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,219
A few years of therapy--

401
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,700
Why did you lie to me about what you were in for?

402
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,870
Okay, so I drove a car into a wall instead of stealing some pills.

403
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,349
<i>You obviously</i> <i>don't care what I did.</i>

404
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,869
You care that I lied to you. You feel jilted.

405
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,250
I feel stupid.

406
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,829
It--it doesn't even make sense.

407
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,669
Why are you doing time? You didn't have any priors.

408
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,980
You didn't hurt anyone.

409
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,110
I had a bad lawyer.

410
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,720
I'm sorry.

411
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,350
We can't talk about this case anymore.

412
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,239
<i>We hear you're gonna</i> <i>need an incentive</i>

413
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,910
to get all my pills by tomorrow.

414
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,949
I--I can't get all 20, but once I get out--

415
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,880
Give us a minute.

416
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,290
Why do you think I'm on buspirone?

417
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,310
The stress!

418
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,600
And I get the runs almost every day.

419
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,199
Any sign of weakness, 20 guys would line up

420
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,780
to stick a sharpened-up toothbrush in my eye.

421
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,349
So as much as my better nature

422
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,510
really wants to give you a pass...

423
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,450
It just wouldn't be good for my health.

424
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,380
See you tomorrow.

425
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,780
I need your help.

426
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,720
You have any matches?

427
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,390
No, that's serious contraband.

428
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,790
What are you planning to do?

429
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,770
What about a stick of gum?

430
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,490
Sure.

431
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,780
I'm gonna need that too.

432
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,090
Why?

433
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,719
Why do I need the pen that you always carry around

434
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,820
and never write with?

435
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,310
This is plan "B."

436
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,210
What happened to your cheek?

437
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,610
What is it?

438
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,330
A fire?

439
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,200
House, we gotta evacuate this area.
Come on.

440
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,230
<i>Hey. Hey, House.</i>

441
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,290
You were saying something about how I should, like, uh, swab or--

442
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,180
You're confusing me with the clinic again.

443
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,240
What?

444
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,860
You're abandoning me? As soon as you leave, I am.

445
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,740
Why? What changed?

446
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,590
I'm just done.

447
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,519
No you, no medicine, no fixing people.

448
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,770
Done. <i>Now get out.</i>

449
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,640
No!

450
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,310
Your lips are swelling.

451
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,190
Open your mouth.

452
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,920
Did you just eat something?

453
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,070
Meatloaf, potatoes, coffee... You allergic to anything?

454
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,840
Guard!

455
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,479
You're going into anaphylactic shock.

456
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,210
Guard! Dammit.

457
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,090
I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.

458
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,859
<i>House, get away from him.</i>
He's having an allergic reaction.

459
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,509
He can't breathe.

460
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,099
<i>Lie on the ground with</i> <i>your hands behind your head.</i>

461
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,089
Alvarez, look at what I'm doing!
It's a tracheotomy. Come on, man.

462
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,150
You know I'm a doctor.

463
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,350
What's wrong with him?

464
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,920
I have no idea.

465
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,440
friday

466
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,660
Saving us both from contraband charges.

467
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,390
It was great knowing you.

468
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,130
I need to be taken into protective custody.

469
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,710
That was great.
I think I really dodged a bullet there.

470
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,800
You don't need P.C.?

471
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,370
Uh, it's nothing personal.

472
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,800
We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise.

473
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,600
It wasn't the food. It was the heat.

474
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,339
It's mastocytosis.
It can be set off by hot liquids,

475
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,849
like the coffee he just drank.

476
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,050
Masto's usually a skin disease. Usually?

477
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,759
<i>It can hit any organ.</i>

478
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,609
<i>Joint pain, osteopenia,</i> <i>and anaphylaxis,</i>

479
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,760
<i>eyebrow loss...</i>

480
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,229
It fits. It's a possibility.

481
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,829
I'll run some blood tests. Thank you.

482
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,800
No, no!

483
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,779
It's almost impossible to confirm masto with blood work.

484
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,250
Just give him five aspirin.

485
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,680
If he has masto,

486
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,049
<i>he'll go into</i> <i>anaphylactic shock</i> and won't be able to breathe again.

487
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,559
You do understand the meaning of the word "confirm."

488
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,340
I'll do it.

489
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,420
<i>I almost died</i> <i>in that cell.</i>

490
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,220
House, you're in here because you think you can do
<i>whatever you want</i> <i>whenever you want.</i>

491
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,649
<i>You can't,</i> <i>and neither can I.</i>

492
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,839
<i>The A.C.L.U.</i> <i>would have my job,</i>
<i>my license,</i> <i>maybe even my house,</i>

493
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,359
if I do an unauthorized experiment--
But if--if it is masto--

494
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,079
<i>It's not.</i>

495
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,239
What do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?
I'm not taking the risk.

496
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,859
It's his risk to take. If he has another attack

497
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,350
and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die!

498
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,960
So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?

499
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,359
I think House is right.

500
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,230
No.

501
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,910
You're a moron and a coward. I'll do it myself.

502
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,230
Guard.

503
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,679
You're done here, just like every other place

504
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,330
you've ever set foot in your life.

505
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,469
<i>If I ever see you</i> <i>in here again,</i> I will write you up,

506
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,480
and they will revoke your parole.

507
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,640
<i>Dr. House.</i>

508
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,350
Did you get all the Vicodin you needed?

509
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,830
I'm not an idiot.

510
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,670
That fire, the bruise on your face...

511
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,329
I talk to prisoners. I know about exit taxes.

512
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,930
You're clearly getting squeezed.

513
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,630
I need 20.

514
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,699
And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.

515
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,249
We'll take care of Nick. You can't if you're not willing--

516
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,120
Just take care of yourself.

517
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,590
Well done.

518
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,279
If knew if you'd learned nothing else in here,

519
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,480
you'd learned the smart thing is to fall in line.

520
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,450
You're absolutely right.

521
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,090
I need backup here.

522
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,810
Son of a bitch.

523
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,600
You'd better be fast...

524
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,120
Come on. Come on!

525
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,480
Thanks for getting me to the clinic.

526
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,680
Take him out.

527
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,560
<i>I've got only two years</i> <i>left in my stretch.</i>

528
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,710
Take him out.

529
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,240
C.O.! We have a little problem here!
I need backup, I need backup!

530
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,030
Alvarez!

531
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,870
<i>Mendelson! Sullivan!</i>

532
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,189
Mendelson! You're gonna pay for this.

533
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,500
Hey...I'm just playing solitaire.

534
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,290
Hands behind your head!

535
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,620
On the ground!

536
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,010
You are so lucky.

537
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,729
We got a guy in an ambulance heading to Princeton General.

538
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,250
Another dozen getting teargas hosed off them.

539
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,040
<i>Hey! Sit down!</i>

540
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,450
Where's the aspirin?

541
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,830
Back off!

542
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,950
Oh, God.

543
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,359
Did you get beaten up on purpose?

544
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,610
House, what are you doing?

545
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,440
House, open up!

546
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,850
<i>This is a direct order!</i>
Yeah, it's always a direct order.

547
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,700
Eight months. Haven't heard an indirect order in here.

548
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,460
Dr. Adams!

549
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,880
They're gonna revoke your parole.

550
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,629
<i>They're gonna charge you</i> <i>with extra crimes.</i>

551
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,680
You'll be here six more months, minimum!

552
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,180
Sorry. Distracted. You were saying?

553
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,509
<i>I checked your file.</i> <i>You didn't have a bad lawyer.</i>

554
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,590
You had no lawyer.

555
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,779
<i>You took the first deal</i> <i>they offered you,</i>

556
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,299
because you wanted to punish yourself.
<i>Do you think</i> <i>getting beaten up,</i>

557
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,869
you think saving this one guy will wipe your slate clean?

558
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:55,600
No.

559
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,700
Then why are you doing this? 'Cause I have a gift.

560
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,979
Once you drink this, should get an attack almost immediately.

561
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,079
<i>That is, if I'm right.</i>

562
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,459
<i>Just bought yourself</i> <i>months in solitary.</i>
Was it really worth it?

563
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,910
If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.

564
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,879
<i>No! No! No! Get the cup!</i>

565
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,869
<i>Get the cup!</i> Just drink it! Drink it!

566
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,540
<i>No! Grab the cup!</i>

567
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,660
<i>Hands behind your back.</i>

568
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,250
What were you thinking?

569
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,410
<i>I don't know.</i> <i>I--I was scared.</i>

570
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,280
No!

571
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,500
<i>You're fired.</i> You're beyond fired.

572
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,470
You're completely unhireable anywhere.

573
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,440
You understand that?

574
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,130
Yes.

575
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,560
Now shut up and let's see if he has an attack.

576
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,760
<i>Come on, just</i> <i>a little more time.</i>

577
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,590
<i>Get him out of here.</i>

578
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,720
saturday

579
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,120
