1
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,450
<i>Don't bother.</i>

2
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,490
He's dead.

3
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,570
You're dead too.

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,210
The fire isn't.

8
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,390
You might want to get up and start heading for the exit signs.

9
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,930
<i>For all I know,</i> I already am up.

10
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,620
More interesting question is why would I hallucinate

11
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,570
an ex-employee who I last saw with a self-inflicted gunshot wound,

12
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,230
<i>as opposed to someone more...</i>

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,730
busty?

14
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,880
<i>Care to explain why you're here?</i> The dead guy.

15
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,300
Who is he?

16
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,730
<i>How'd you meet him?</i>

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,410
I was in a car accident last month.

18
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,180
I won a swimming trophy in high school.

19
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,200
Your turn.

20
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,850
I-I ran out of pain medication. I got an orbital fracture.

21
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,610
It's just taking ages to heal. Take off your shirt.

22
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,040
My eye's up here.

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,670
Orbital fracture means your face went into the windshield,

24
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,010
which means your chest went into the steering wheel.

25
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,410
Painkillers can suppress heart rate, so unless you want me to kill you,

26
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,420
take off your shirt, let me do a heart exam.

27
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,550
I also wanted to see the ring of burns

28
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,510
around your collarbone.

29
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,940
How'd you know?

30
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,850
The codeine allergy you told the nurse about.

31
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,630
That's shorthand for "give me the strong stuff," which matches your seen-better-days-

32
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,440
because-my-life- fell-apart suit.

33
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,600
The two old burns on your fingers mean you tend to nod off with a cigarette in your hand.

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,940
No reason you shouldn't do that with one in your mouth.

35
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,290
May all your doctors be stupid.

36
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,660
Hold on a second.

37
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,370
That bruising around your belly button.

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,560
Well, you might get some fun drugs

39
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,620
out of this after all.

40
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,120
Cullen's sign.

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,530
But the ultrasound showed air as well as blood.

42
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,760
Now, I know what you're thinking. <i>Hemorrhagic pancreatitis.</i>

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,250
But I also know what I'm thinking.

44
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,640
Doesn't explain the pneuomoperitoneum.

45
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,390
You took a new case? You ran tests yourself?

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,020
I saw the chance to help someone in need, and I instinctively--

47
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,560
oh, no, wait, that was someone else's instinct. <i>Wilson is dying.</i>

48
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,310
Your parole officer is probably on his way here right now.

49
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,570
How are you possibly in a good mood?

50
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,400
<i>Did you never see Dead Poets Society?</i> <i>Carpe diem.</i>

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,340
Air in his abdomen could mean

52
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,370
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

53
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,560
But blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,820
Blah. Blah, blah.

55
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,010
Nobody cares about the medicine.
 <i>It was perforated ulcer.</i>

56
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,340
Laparotomy to find the hole in his tummy and close it up.

57
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,610
You didn't answer the team's question.

58
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,310
Which is weird, because normally, when I talk to my own employees,

59
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,300
I'm under oath and hooked up to a lie detector.

60
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,690
You were looking at six months of prison instead of five months of Wilson.

61
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,720
Why happy? Obviously I had a plan.

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,190
Obviously, obviously you had a plan.

63
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,990
The more interesting question is why you didn't tell the team.

64
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,810
I think it's because part of you knew from the start that the plan wouldn't work.

65
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,070
- I need a meeting. - I'm busy. Call my office.

66
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,110
Yes...

67
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,360
because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,610
I need a meeting. Thanks for fitting me in.

69
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,980
My team has eight urgent, life-or-death cases

70
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,140
that they've been waiting for me to accept or reject.

71
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,370
When is that not true?

72
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,390
Well, right now, for one.

73
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,650
But tell my parole board that I'm taking all eight...

74
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,790
that no one else can crack them, that you need me here for the next five months

75
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,580
or eight people will die.

76
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,270
You're asking me to perjure myself.

77
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,260
It's a tiny, white lie.

78
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,810
No offense.

79
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,990
Especially since, from what I hear, nothing black is tiny.

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,040
Except your penis, I guess.

81
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,710
You really think I wanted to cave in that ceiling?

82
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,090
It was a prank that went wrong.

83
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,240
Dock my pay, sue me--

84
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,960
Felony vandalism should have added another year or two to your sentence.

85
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,320
It's a miracle the parole board agreed to six months.

86
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,590
I will go to jail, eventually.

87
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,690
I will pay the price.

88
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,290
I just rather that Wilson didn't.

89
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,750
Come on, be a friend.

90
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,700
Okay.

91
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,810
But whatever cases you have, you have to take them all.

92
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,910
"Be a friend"?

93
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,100
How many fingers am I holding up?

94
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,230
Of course you know it's three, because you know everything I know.

95
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,680
Everything my smack-addled brain can remember,

96
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,850
including that I actually said, "be a friend."

97
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,050
My point wasn't that you said it.

98
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,340
My point was, once again, why?

99
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,850
I think it's because part of you knew you were gonna need a friend.

100
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,850
Part of you knew the plan,

101
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,390
even when it was working, wouldn't work.

102
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,390
And right now, I'm curious about why you're sitting on the ground

103
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,770
instead of heading for the door.

104
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,630
Guess we figured out why you're seeing me,

105
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,720
your suicidal friend.

106
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,680
He'll call you twice a day.

107
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,850
Then his wife will call you twice a day to make sure she understands what he told her you told him,

108
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,160
which she won't because he didn't.

109
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,790
Maybe you want to give this one to Connors.

110
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,960
Where's House? Don't know, don't care.

111
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,820
Working.

112
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,860
Excuse me.

113
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,700
No one has seen or heard from him since two nights ago.

114
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm sure he's enjoying himself.

115
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,600
Last time he went to prison, he maxed out his credit cards.

116
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,480
Last time he went to prison,

117
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,300
he thought he had you waiting for him.

118
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,780
You think he could've done something stupid?

119
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,000
I think stupid is our best-case scenario.

120
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,690
Why do you want to kill yourself?

121
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,400
Well, here's a reason.

122
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,970
I can't even get stoned without some annoying jerk

123
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,630
deciding I need to be deeply analyzed.

124
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,450
Isn't this just an incredibly simple calculation?

125
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,870
I'm going to jail, losing my job, losing my best friend.

126
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,860
Do I need more?

127
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,510
You think that's the sum total of who you are? A doctor? A friend to Wilson?

128
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm also a tremendous baritone.

129
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,980
Now go away.

130
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,540
Even with your subconscious, you're evasive.

131
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,250
Death's not interesting.

132
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,890
You exist for what's interesting.

133
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,550
Puzzles, ideas, analysis.

134
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,750
Death is the opposite of a cool puzzle.

135
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,690
It's eternal nothingness.

136
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,930
<i>But you don't find life interesting anymore.</i>

137
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,100
<i>Stop being an idiot.</i>

138
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,620
Can I have Kutner back, please? How much pathetic wallowing do I have to sit through?

139
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,490
How are things in hell? Is the humidity the big issue?

140
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,000
What happened next with the guy's medical case?

141
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,540
Why? Exactly.

142
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,000
Why am I, meaning you,

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,950
<i>still obsessing about this case?</i>

144
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,560
<i>Obviously we think it's relevant</i> to why we're still sitting on the floor of a burning building.

145
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,890
There was a code. 

146
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,870
Gotta be a clot in his lungs.

147
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,970
We need to get him to an O.R. <i>No time. His O-2 stats are falling.</i>

148
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,520
<i>We have to suck it out here. Bedside embolectomy.</i>

149
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,000
Float a catheter through his heart and his oxygenation will get even worse.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,090
<i>He'll die before we can finish the procedure.</i>

151
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,950
House, we need a call here.

152
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,230
What are you doing? What did you give him?

153
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,900
Five, four...

154
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,510
three, two...

155
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,260
Naloxone.

156
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,190
<i>We should've got suspicious</i> when his visiting cousin

157
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,450
signed in as "Mr. Tar H. Horse."

158
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,780
<i>Heroin caused the respiratory distress.</i>

159
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,740
The naloxone turned off the receptors, caused your distress.

160
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,430
I'm not gonna stop doing drugs!

161
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,520
It's reality that sucks!

162
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,610
You're saying I'm lying... to my subconscious?

163
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,270
People do it all the time. And like it or not, you are a person.

164
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,950
He said every one of those things. But not then and not like that.

165
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,670
This guy was going nuts from the naloxone.

166
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,470
He couldn't be rational if you wanted him to be, which you did.

167
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,460
Why? I compressed the story a little--

168
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,830
Context matters.

169
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,570
You never talk to patients for non-diagnostic reasons,

170
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,520
but this guy...

171
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,240
Feeling better?

172
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,810
I'm not gonna stop doing drugs.

173
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,910
You were a stockbroker.

174
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,030
Son of a stockbroker.

175
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,470
<i>- Married, children. - I was miserable.</i>

176
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,910
Well, you say you were miserable

177
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,590
because you need to rationalize screwing it up.

178
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,070
Except I didn't.

179
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,920
I mean, I-I did.

180
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,910
But I'm not miserable. Not anymore.

181
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,130
I had a ski injury

182
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,290
and painkillers weren't enough,

183
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,810
and a friend of mine gave me some heroin.

184
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,460
The second it entered my veins,

185
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,880
it was like God had taken over my body.

186
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,310
It was like there was no more pain

187
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,430
or unhappiness in my life or anybody else's.

188
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,940
But then you lost everything.

189
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,010
<i>Everything wasn't enough.</i>

190
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,270
Because it's reality that sucks.

191
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,370
Are you arguing that he's a good role model?

192
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,600
- He's happy. - He's dead.

193
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,200
You heard what you wanted to hear.

194
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,330
The more interesting question--

195
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,510
always--is why you wanted to hear it.

196
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,830
I'm sorry????

197
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,420
that's???

198
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,420
she's???

199
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,480
You're stealing this guy's oxygen?

200
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,820
There's oxygen everywhere.

201
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,640
You passed on all your cases, reassigned them to other doctors.

202
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,540
They weren't interesting.

203
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,230
They were my reason for getting your sentence delayed!

204
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,340
Yeah, well, I guess you'll have to tell the parole board something else.

205
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,630
Maybe that I was in the O.R.

206
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,610
the entire day the ceiling collapsed, so I couldn't have caused the plumbing problem.

207
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,650
- You set me up. - Not really.

208
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,400
You were going to basically perjure yourself so that I could delay jail time.

209
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,710
Doesn't it make more sense to actually perjure yourself

210
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,010
so that I can actually avoid jail time?

211
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,730
Why are you doing this?

212
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,280
Why are you risking destroying yourself? <i>There's no risk. I know you.</i>

213
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
You'll do the honest thing.

214
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,730
You'll lie.

215
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,500
No.

216
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,280
He's happy.

217
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,170
He's dead.

218
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,600
You weren't worried. Of course I was worried. My plan fell through.

219
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,630
The plan didn't matter.

220
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,760
Your plan to replace that plan didn't matter.

221
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,640
Wilson didn't matter. Jail didn't matter.

222
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,530
The only thing that mattered, <i>the only thing that ever mattered,</i>

223
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,110
was the puzzle.

224
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,880
I noticed a slight twitch in his thenar eminence,

225
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,580
which meant...

226
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,030
You're dying.

227
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,910
Because my thumb's a little shaky?

228
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,690
Plus the thinning in the muscle, plus that speech you gave at Yankee Stadium

229
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,540
saying you were the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

230
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,230
Add them up, it means ALS.

231
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,730
Lou Gehrig's disease?

232
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,400
You're trapped in your body, you can't move or speak while you just die.

233
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,360
If it makes you feel any better, at this rate, it'll be fast.

234
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,410
You're not symmetrical.

235
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,160
<i>Wait.</i> Now you're standing at the door.

236
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,040
What happened in the meantime? And lo, there was a miraculous wonder--

237
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,180
I walked across the room.

238
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,160
No, you just skipped over a chunk of conversation.

239
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,870
He swore that he would live a better and more selfless life in his remaining time,

240
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,680
blah, blah, blah.

241
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,810
After two blahs, I'd heard enough.

242
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,930
I moved to the door.

243
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,550
No, you're avoiding it.

244
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,280
Do you smell smoke?

245
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,170
Fair enough.

246
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,810
You're not symmetrical.

247
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,270
The veins on your right side are distended.

248
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,240
<i>What does that mean?</i> There's a bulge in your superclavicular notch.

249
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,970
There's something in there. What?

250
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,440
<i>Well, I'm not that good a doctor.</i>

251
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,140
Good news: Your case is fascinating.

252
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,960
<i>And good news for you:</i> You're gonna live.

253
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,030
You've inhaled a small branch,

254
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,470
probably while you were realizing that it's all worth it while you were passed out

255
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,440
on a park bench. Anyone else would have coughed it up,

256
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,200
but 'cause you're a junkie, your cough reflex is suppressed. And it grew?

257
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,270
Not unless you also inhaled a chunk of the sun

258
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,250
and a drip-irrigation system, you idiot.

259
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,470
It set off an auto-immune reaction, which-- I can't help saying this--

260
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,820
was the root of all your problems.

261
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,140
You're smiling.

262
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,830
I was, and now I'm not

263
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,980
because a moment's fun a few days ago does not trump a friend dying.

264
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,470
Yeah, it does, you idiot.

265
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,810
'Cause after he's dead, you cry for a while,

266
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,880
and then you go back to doing what you love.

267
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,180
Every patient that I've had, 70 years from now, they'll all be

268
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,010
as dead as Wilson.

269
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,530
Everybody dies. It's meaningless.

270
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,400
When you solve a puzzle, the world makes sense, and everything feels right.

271
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,120
And you'll always have another one, because people always get sick.

272
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,970
It's shallow and it's insignificant, but if you don't give a damn if idiots live,

273
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,190
why would you possibly give a damn about shallowness?

274
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,930
<i>It makes you happy.</i>

275
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,950
<i>And why would you need more than that?</i>

276
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,300
<i>Go home.</i>

277
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,190
Foreman!

278
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,330
House would never leave food out here rotting for days.

279
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,500
His suitcases are in his closet.

280
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,630
If we had handled this differently--

281
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,320
We did the right thing.

282
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,160
Hello?

283
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,920
I'll let his accountant know.

284
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,240
House no-showed on a hooker two nights ago.

285
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
Outgoing calls.

286
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,460
Hooker...

287
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,550
me... I didn't pick up.

288
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,060
Chinese place...

289
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,140
Wait, wait, wait. Who's that?

290
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,140
He called four times. I don't know.

291
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,280
It's a total disaster.

292
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,790
Do you have any idea how hard it is to schedule a cable appointment

293
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,910
<i>with the hours that I work?</i> House has been missing for two days.

294
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,760
<i>We know talked to you.</i>

295
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,840
<i>Anything you can tell us about his mental state,</i>

296
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,630
or where he was headed-- anything at all--

297
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,140
Would be a breach of confidentiality and a violation of the law.

298
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,540
Not if he's a danger to himself or someone else.

299
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,320
Is this coming out of our 50 minutes? Is this your douche bag group?

300
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,950
Excuse me.

301
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,620
What makes you think he's a danger to himself?

302
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,890
He hasn't been home, but he didn't take anything with him, not even his cell.

303
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,390
You're not saying anything, which means he didn't specifically mention suicide,

304
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,990
but you came out here to talk to us,

305
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,050
<i>so he must have said something that worries you.</i>

306
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,310
There are other ways of reaching oblivion.

307
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,620
- Vicodin? - He always has his Vicodin.

308
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,660
There's no reason to call a shr--

309
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,460
his last patient was a heroin addict.

310
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,070
So I guess we're all done here.

311
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,340
The guy's address has gotta be in the file. 

312
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,740
<i>What about God?</i>

313
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,860
<i>You were leaving, and then you stopped.</i> Why?

314
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,050
Your theory is I'm not leaving, because I believe in God?

315
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,300
What, he's calling me home?

316
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,780
Maybe falling through that floor was a sign. Maybe that the universe hates you--something.

317
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,190
<i>You really don't believe?</i>

318
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,970
Really? Not in some deep crack

319
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,760
of some remote recess of some dark corner of your mind?

320
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,040
No.

321
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,790
Except that some deep crack of some remote recess of some dark corner

322
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,740
<i>is here telling me-- that's enough.</i>

323
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,780
In a burning building, facing imminent death, that's more than enough.

324
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,720
Pascal's wager is facile.

325
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,600
Saying it's facile is facile.

326
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,780
Why is it wrong?

327
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,340
And don't be logical. Be desperate.

328
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,760
You gotta have something to hold on to.

329
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,450
You can't live your life based on something you don't believe.

330
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,920
But you can end your life based on something you don't believe?

331
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,820
What about love? I lived with you for years.

332
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,730
I know you believe in love.

333
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
Foreman wouldn't help me,

334
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,300
which means I need you to take the fall.

335
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,240
You do remember I'm dying, right?

336
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,760
Which is you will never spend a day in jail.

337
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,960
Fresh-faced, cancer-ridden.

338
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,380
It's tough to do both, but you pull it off. Your fingerprints are all over those hockey tickets.

339
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,990
I never admitted to flushing anything.

340
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:05,660
My prints make sense if I gave those tickets to you as an incentive to stay alive.

341
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,210
And I was so angry that you didn't respect my dying wishes,

342
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,790
I took thousands of dollars of season tickets and flushed them down toilets?

343
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,560
All you have to do is create reasonable doubt.

344
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,570
Great, what if I do more than that? What if I end up in jail?

345
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,520
Or spending my final months in endless hearings?

346
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,450
That is a risk you are willing to take.

347
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,540
I have a reputation. I have a legacy that could--

348
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,050
Wilson...

349
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,760
I don't want to lose this time with you.

350
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,690
Okay.

351
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,130
Thanks.

352
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,660
I knew I could count on you.

353
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,650
Wait! Wait.

354
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,480
You want the fries back?

355
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,820
I'm not gonna take the fall.

356
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,380
Don't do this to me, Wilson.

357
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,620
This is our only option.

358
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,670
Exactly, because you overplayed your hand with Foreman,

359
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,600
because you knew you had me as a backstop.

360
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,490
Even with me dying, you just assumed

361
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,470
I'd be here to bail you out. Since you're here,

362
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,870
and you are bailing me out,

363
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,030
seems like a pretty safe assumption.

364
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,570
I won't be here soon.

365
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,590
If I do this, I'm teaching you that your bad behavior will always be rewarded.

366
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,710
You need to learn-- How to act when you're gone?

367
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,540
'Cause if that's the lesson, we got a really great opportunity coming up.

368
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,120
You'll just try to find someone else, and it won't work, and it shouldn't work!

369
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,430
So that's the great wisdom you're imparting?

370
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,940
That I'll always be alone?

371
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,820
There's only one person you can count on.

372
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,570
I thought there were two.

373
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,660
I need to do this...

374
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,020
for you.

375
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,140
Wilson's right. <i>He's always right.</i>

376
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,230
<i>He's always been your good side.</i>

377
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,200
I always wondered why I photographed so poorly.

378
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,060
And because he's always played that role,

379
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,680
you've never had to develop a conscience of your own.

380
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,740
People don't change.

381
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,660
Consciences don't spontaneously develop.

382
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,480
You're wrong, Greg.

383
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,050
Which is...

384
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,750
why you'll be better off without him.

385
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,220
You've been looking to him

386
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,190
to find what you have gotta find within yourself.

387
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,970
<i>Something you can find.</i>

388
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,370
Hold your child.

389
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,590
This is a reason to die.

390
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,090
This is what my life could've been, not what it can be.

391
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,530
<i>If it could've been,</i>

392
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,790
you're capable of it now.

393
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,760
You're married. Cuddy's gone.

394
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,620
We aren't the only two people who could love you.

395
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,190
Why settle so easily?

396
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,200
These are just idiotic fantasies...

397
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,490
Greg, don't.

398
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,800
At odds with every logical bone in my body.

399
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,630
Get up.

400
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,150
You do not have to die in here!

401
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,010
Is this hell?

402
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
An eternity of people trying to convince me to live?

403
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,160
Who says I'm here to convince you to live?

404
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,030
You're the last one I thought would hate me.

405
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,520
I don't hate you.

406
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,750
I love you.

407
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,190
And yet you think I deserve to die.

408
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,200
But not as a punishment.

409
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,460
As a reward.

410
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,380
I think... you've suffered enough.

411
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,290
You've given enough.

412
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,560
I think you deserve a chance to just...

413
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,240
give up.

414
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,490
Like Wilson did? Like Wilson did.

415
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,330
You accepted his choice, that ending the pain

416
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,250
was better than the pain.

417
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,110
Why can't you give yourself that gift?

418
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,970
This is the address House's patient gave?

419
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,800
Everybody lies.

420
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,930
You smell smoke?

421
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,610
Just let go.

422
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,780
Just go to sleep.

423
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,560
I had a chance to avoid this.

424
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,140
You had many chances, and you blew them all up.

425
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,410
No, this was different.

426
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,240
They're all different, but the reasons are all the same.

427
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,340
You're arrogant. You're self-destructive.

428
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,530
You only care about yourself.

429
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,550
That moment with the patient...

430
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,250
the chunk of the conversation I skipped over...

431
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,210
I told him he was dying.

432
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,780
If it makes you feel any better, at this rate, it'll be fast.

433
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,280
Let me take the fall.

434
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,370
For you, for that prank.

435
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,080
You don't owe me anything.

436
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,180
- You tried to save me. - I failed.

437
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,210
Motives don't matter. Only actions.

438
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,290
Trying is an action. Why are you trying to talk me out of this?

439
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,000
You just fake the records.

440
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,720
You say I came into the clinic last week.

441
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,360
I'll tell the cops you treated me like crap,

442
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,790
so I stole your tickets and flushed 'em.

443
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,220
Thank you.

444
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,890
And you're doing this because you're dying?

445
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,670
I'm doing this because I have nothing left to lose.

446
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,100
So when you were living, you did nothing for anyone

447
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,670
and you didn't care. Now that you're dying,

448
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,300
you're willing to help a virtual stranger.

449
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,740
Which means you're a better person dying

450
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,870
than you ever were living,

451
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,610
and the world is a better place

452
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,850
because I didn't save you.

453
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,490
Which makes me wonder why I'm about to tell you...

454
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,210
you're not symmetrical. 

455
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,050
What's your point?

456
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,130
That you cared about him more than you cared about yourself?

457
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,110
You cared about the puzzle

458
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,280
more than you cared about yourself.

459
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,480
If I kept it to myself,

460
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
then it would just be a puzzle,

461
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,580
but I opened my mouth because I thought it was more.

462
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,130
You know it's the same, or you wouldn't be bickering with me while the flames lick at your feet.

463
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,860
You're afraid of this decision, and you are trying to argue

464
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,550
until fate takes it out of your hands.

465
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,600
<i>You're taking the cowardly way out.</i>

466
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,320
And worse...

467
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,450
you're too cowardly to even admit you're taking the cowardly way out.

468
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,310
You're right.

469
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,400
But I can change.

470
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,480
He could've gotten out.

471
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,420
People are found sometimes, even in...

472
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,190
collapsed--

473
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,120
I think they're pulling a body out.

474
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,060
Coroner confirms it's him.

475
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,530
Dental records match.

476
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,850
House hired me when no one else would.

477
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,180
He got me fired.

478
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,830
He gave me the guts to get fired.

479
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,020
He gave me the courage to quit.

480
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,460
<i>Gregory was--</i> he was a good son.

481
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,600
<i>He was a trying boyfriend,</i>

482
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,690
<i>but I...</i>

483
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,630
never stopped loving him.

484
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,660
He was my husband for real.

485
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,980
I couldn't help but love him.

486
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,580
He was my boss.

487
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,840
And my employee.

488
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,270
And both times...

489
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:06,860
I learned from him.

490
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,720
<i>He made me a better parent,</i>

491
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,540
whether he meant to or not.

492
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,140
<i>He was willing to kill me.</i>

493
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
And I'll always be grateful.

494
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
<i>He wasn't always</i> easy to deal with.

495
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,720
But somewhere in there...

496
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,250
he knew how to love.

497
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,110
He was my friend.

498
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,430
The thing you have to...

499
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,580
remember--

500
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:47,000
the thing you can't forget is that Gregory House

501
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,930
saved lives.

502
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,800
He was a healer.

503
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,720
And--and in the end...

504
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,910
House was an ass.

505
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,340
<i>He mocked anyone--</i>

506
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,090
patients, co-workers, his dwindling friends--

507
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,860
anyone who didn't measure up to his insane ideals of integrity.

508
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,510
<i>He claimed to be on some heroic quest for truth,</i>

509
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,590
<i>but the truth is, he was a bitter jerk</i> <i>who liked making people miserable.</i>

510
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,950
And he proved that by dying selfishly,

511
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,140
numbed by narcotics, without a thought of anyone.

512
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,940
A betrayal of everyone who cared about him.

513
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,780
Phone.

514
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,810
A million times he needed me, and the one time that I needed him--

515
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,710
Oh, come on. This is a funeral.

516
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,340
Just get it.

517
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,320
Well, this is embarrassing.

518
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,110
Could've sworn I turned this off.

519
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,760
This isn't my phone.

520
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,440
SHUT UP YOU IDIOT

521
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,460
???

522
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,800
How?

523
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,520
I got out of the back of the building.

524
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,500
The body--

525
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,730
Just switched the dental records.

526
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,140
You're destroying your entire life.

527
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,820
You can't go back from this.

528
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,580
You'll go to jail for years.

529
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,070
You can never be a doctor again.

530
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,710
I'm dead, Wilson.

531
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,400
How do you want to spend your last five months?

532
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,390
* Shadows are falling *

533
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,380
* and I'm running out of breath *

534
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,370
* keep me in your heart for a while *

535
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,440
* If I leave you, it doesn't mean I love you any less *

536
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,560
* keep me in your heart for a while *

537
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:03,170
* when you get up in the morning *

538
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,130
* and you see that crazy sun *

539
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,960
* keep me in your heart for a while *

540
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,450
* there's a train leaving nightly *

541
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,980
* called when all is said and done *

542
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,910
* keep me your heart for a while *

543
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,510
* sha-la-la-la *

544
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,860
* la-la-la-la-la-li-lo *

545
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,420
* keep me in your heart for a while *

546
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,230
* sha-la-la-la *

547
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,570
* la-la-la-la-li-lo *

548
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,320
* keep me in your heart for a while *

549
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,470
* sometimes when you're doin' *

550
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,020
* simple things around the house *

551
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,910
* maybe you'll think of me and smile *

552
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,360
* you know I'm tied to you *

553
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,770
* like the buttons on your blouse *

554
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,310
* keep me in your heart for a while *

555
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,080
* sha-la-la-la *

556
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,530
* la-la-la-la-la-li-lo *

557
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,580
* keep me in your heart for a while *

558
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,620
* sha-la-la-la *

559
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,370
* la-la-la-la-li-lo *

560
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,660
* keep me in your heart for a while *

561
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,930
When the cancer starts getting really bad...

562
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,240
Cancer's boring.

563
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,060
* Enjoy yourself *

564
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,090
* it's later than you think *

565
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,300
* enjoy yourself *

566
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,400
* while you're still in the pink *

567
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,560
* the years go by *

568
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,800
* as quickly as a wink *

569
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,120
* enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself *

570
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,530
* it's later than you think, hey *

571
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,710
* you're gonna take that two-week trip *

572
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,820
* no matter come what may *

573
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,930
* but every year you put it off *

574
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,170
* you just can't get away *

575
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,350
* next year for sure you'll hit the road *

576
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,540
* you'll really get around *

577
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,480
* but how far can you travel *

578
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,000
* when you're six feet underground? *

579
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,410
* enjoy yourself *

580
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,460
* it's later than you think *

581
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,670
* enjoy yourself *

582
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,720
