<i>Morning has broken </i>

5
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:35,157
<i>like the first morning </i>

00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,830
<i>like the first bird</i>

8
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,331
Nice tie.

00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:47,186
<i>Praise for the singing</i>

00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:51,390
<i>

<i>
praise for them springing</i>

12
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:56,228
Are you at least gonna call the cops this time?

13
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:58,362
No, then they might stop.

14
00:00:58,874 --> 00:01:01,011
Just when they're beginning to, uh...

15
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:03,477
Capture my eyes.

16
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:05,703
Come on, Dad. Let Rodrigo do this.

17
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:06,871
Your arthritis is obviously-

18
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,599
I can pick up my own lawn.

19
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:12,363
You know, if you wanted,
you could put an end to all this.

20
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,327
Oh, of course.

21
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:14,829
There are other ways to save the company.

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,799
I'm only moving it to China
because I'm craving egg foo yung.

23
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:22,803
You know, I just got off the phone
with some investors.

24
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:25,657
Yes, and they want a controlling interest.

25
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:29,594
We get to stay here with the people
who've been so loyal to this company.

26
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:31,338
Everyone keeps their jobs.

27
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:33,731
It's been a family business for 120 years.

28
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:35,049
There's no way that I'm letting...

29
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,020
<i>
Blackbird has spoken</i>

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,780


31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,390
What's wrong?

32
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,228

<i>
Fresh from the word</i>

38
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:04,978
I need you to drive me to a doctor.

39
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:16,451
This would totally suck.

40
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:19,924
Patient's visited China a lot recently.

41
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,493
What about the JBE virus?

42
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:25,679
Why don't you check his vaccination record
before you make another stupid...

43
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:28,299
O.M.F.G.

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,800
50% off cupcakes.

45
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:30,968
How sick is the patient?

46
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,336
'Cause this expires today.

47
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:34,522
Central serous retinopathy?

48
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:36,774
It's linked to type "A" personalities.

49
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,025
Funduscopic exam was normal.

50
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:42,116
If you don't let me read my email,
then I won't be able to read the email to the entire staff.

51
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:44,047
From your ex-boss.

52
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,337
Thank you.

53
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:55,826
"Last month, I had an incident
"involving another P.P.T.H. employee.

54
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:59,547
"Though I can't speak to the details of the case
"while my disciplinary hearing is pending,

55
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:03,250
"I want you to know that I have completed
"voluntary sexual harassment training.

56
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,370
"And on a personal note,
"if my actions caused anyone distress,

57
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,718
I sincerely apologize. "

58
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,010
You are so fired.

59
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:14,311
What? He apologized.

60
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:16,680
What? Because he said he apologized?

61
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:20,627
He's saying he's sorry that someone,
namely you, overreacted- namely, by punching him.

62
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:22,236
He grabbed my behind.

63
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:27,408
Word is it was a celebratory slap
after you completed your first-ever AVM embolization.

64
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:32,947
He grabbed it, he apologized for grabbing it,
and now he's taking classes because he grabbed it.

65
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,748
The classes make him sympathetic.

66
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:38,206
Which, in turn, makes his unrepentant attacker...

67
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,203
Evil.

68
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:42,739
Which, in turn,
in turn, makes you so fired.

69
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,108
100 bucks says I won't get fired.

70
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,946
Oh, you don't wanna bet me.

71
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,273
Oh, my.

72
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:57,573
You're fired.

73
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:00,813
I- the bet is-
- But I thought- - After-

74
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:01,979
- then- - I-oh-

75
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,272
if only...

76
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,543
The bet's that I'll get fired after my hearing!

77
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:12,047
I'll take that action too,
but you're already a C-note in the hole.

78
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:13,070
You're late.

79
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:16,925
Considering I don't work here,
<i>arguably, I'm early.</i>

80
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:18,242
Pearl earrings?

81
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:19,793
<i>Knee-length dress.</i>

82
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,462
That's not a very shameful walk of shame.

83
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:22,889
I was at a job interview.

84
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,715
<i>I hope it went terribly.</i>

85
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:25,782
<i>Thad Barton?</i>

86
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:27,618
We only help rich white guys?

87
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:29,887
<i>I am an equal opportunity exploiter.</i>

88
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:32,289
I only help those who can help myself.

89
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,012
I have a department to re-fund.

90
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,187
Atropine poisoning.

91
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:41,374
<i>He's moving his company to China,</i>
and his employees are hanging him in effigy.

92
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,350
Could have moved on to the real thing.

93
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,685
Pupils are normal.

94
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,570
Thyrotoxicosis?

95
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:50,451
Not... A terrible idea.

96
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:52,776
I'm gonna go give him P.T.U.

97
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:54,866
and T.L.C.

98
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,414
I have no idea what that second one stands for.

99
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:02,786
Things don't seem small anymore, they-

100
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:09,093
<i>I woke up from a nap and, uh,</i>
everything went from really small to really huge.

101
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:12,703
Well, then, these giant balls of medicine
are not gonna work anymore.

102
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:16,107
The change actually makes things simpler.

103
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:19,019
Your occipital lobe is acting up,
giving you a migraine.

104
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,671
I don't have a headache.

105
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,739
Not all migraines present that way.

106
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,942
It's called Alice in Wonderland syndrome.

107
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:26,243
Seriously?

108
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,036
I never joke.

109
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,914
<i>Good news is,</i>
<i>it's treatable with medication.</i>

110
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:31,982
<i>Bad news is...</i>

111
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:37,020
It can make you very, very late
for very important dates.

112
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,740
I sometimes joke.

113
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:40,991
Thank you, Doctor.

114
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:44,962
Well, if you really want to thank me,
my department's not really a department.

115
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:48,298
'Cause my boss says he doesn't have the money.

116
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:52,035
Which provides a nice contrast... with you.

117
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:56,156
We're trying to find money in our budget
so we don't have to move our operations overseas.

118
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:58,592
I get it. Answer's no.

119
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,344
Shouldn't have said anything.

120
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:04,231
I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up
before you left for China.

121
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:08,068
'Cause I'm not sure the doctors over there
would be so optimistic,considering...

122
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,237
...how they look down on mental illness

123
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,776
you speak mandarin

124
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,744
<i>What are you guys talking about?</i>

125
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:20,030
Oh, just how different the two cultures are.

126
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,499
<i>For example, our opinions on mental illness.</i>

127
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,076
Here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition.

128
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,501
????

129
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:29,807
----??

130
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:35,346
Is everything okay?

131
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:36,423
Everything's fine.

132
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:41,085
I'd never breach confidentiality,but...

133
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:46,586
I could have you checked into a facility
that exclusively treats mental disorders.

134
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,225
How does that sound?

135
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,547
Whatever's gonna get him better.

136
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:53,378
<i>Let's try the medication first.</i>

137
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,888
How much do you want?

138
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:02,896
You're hired!

139
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:07,795
Oh, you guys are gonna love Doctors Chase and Taub.

140
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:11,628
Keep your Nazi sentiments quiet around the little one.

141
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,356
You got the money?
<i>How?</i>

142
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,252
Patient's a smart businessman.

143
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:17,171
He's destroying thousands of jobs.

144
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:18,639
Jobs are not being destroyed.

145
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,973
They're being relocated.

146
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:24,678
The fact that you see that as inherently bad
means you're an irrational patriot.

147
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,764
To put it another way, a patriot.

148
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:27,704
<i>Patriotism is natural.</i>

149
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:30,484
We've always relied on our tribes to keep us safe.

150
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:35,572
<i>It's helpful for society</i>
if its members have positive feelings about that society.

151
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:36,573
Iranian women.

152
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:38,459
Drag Queens in Uganda.

153
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,130
Patriotism is nothing but loyalty to real estate,
real estate that's been conquered 800 times

154
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,316
by 800 different regimes with 800 different cultures.

155
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,498
But each time, it's just the best.

156
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:53,606
I claim this burger
in the name of Queen Isabella of Spain.

157
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:56,988
I'll go check on the patient.

158
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,895
I have Hepatitis C.

159
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,902
She got it from me.

160
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,115
Hey, how's my dad doing?

161
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,483
Ah, great.

162
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:23,320
His vision's back to normal,
and if he remains asymptomatic through the night,

163
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:24,788
we'll be able to release him in the morning.

164
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:27,105
Any chance that could happen before 9:00?

165
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,160
Our stock dropped a couple points today
with the news that he's sick.

166
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:34,197
I would love for him to get out of here
before the market opens.

167
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,668
No offense, but, uh,

168
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:41,505
I think it's terrible your dad's closing down
all your American operations.

169
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,342
I don't think he's moving the company out of greed.

170
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:48,545
He's moving it out of grief.

171
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:52,115
My mom, she died four months ago.

172
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,303
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and...

173
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:59,556
It's been hard for him- living in their house,
driving down the same streets.

174
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:02,175
I mean, he's constantly reminded of her.

175
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,111
Dad?

176
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:08,499
<i>I need an intubation kit in here!</i>

177
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:09,899
What's going on?

178
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:14,793
Angiography showed a hemorrhagic site
in the left lower lobe.

179
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:17,955
I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome.

180
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:21,916
Are you sure Foreman's okay with this thing
in his office?

181
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:24,019
He's never gonna know.

182
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,288
He's actually in here right now.

183
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,290
Blood count and protein count are normal.

184
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,243
I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome.

185
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:35,530
Sorry, but after Park sent out here hospital-wide
non-apology apology this morning,

186
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,265
I assume that plagiarism is the new black.

187
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,067
If it makes Andrews look sympathetic...

188
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:41,319
Copying him makes you look pathetic.

189
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,372
And I will pay you not to go to anger management classes.

190
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,706
What about another clotting problem?

191
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,176
Factor 5 Leiden deficiency.

192
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,544
<i>It's possible.</i>

193
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,927
Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.

194
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,415
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

195
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,348
I heard about your conversation
with the patient's daughter.

196
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:57,085
You were hostile.

197
00:09:57,086 --> 00:10:00,322
Well, their company's making a decision
I strongly disagree with.

198
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:04,593
Yet you were never anything but courteous
to the racists and rapists in prison.

199
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:06,094
Those guys made decisions you supported?

200
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:07,795
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

201
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:11,099
I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral
you attended yesterday morning.

202
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,734
I was at a job interview.

203
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:14,487
You got to work at 9:15.

204
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,891
Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty
is 45 minutes away.

205
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:18,690
It's not possible.

206
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,025
My condolences.

207
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,959
I wasn't at a funeral.

208
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:26,448
That just leaves...

209
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,249
Everywhere but a job interview.

210
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,484
Get out.

211
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:30,749
<i>Who goes there?</i>

212
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,014
Reveal yourself!

213
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,004
Now.

214
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,205
<i>Well, we would.</i>

215
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:39,594
<i>But Orthopedics is still squatting</i>
<i>in two thirds of my office, which is weird,

216
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:43,898
'cause you got a large check last night.

217
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,802
From a corporation that's going through
a very public belt-tightening.

218
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:49,904
<i>Means this donation was given under duress.</i>

219
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:56,661
<i>Patient didn't tell me the whole story,</i>
but he did say he'd be thrilled if we didn't cash this.

220
00:10:58,064 --> 00:11:00,082
Got a policy review meeting in here in five minutes.

221
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:01,599
Good-bye.

222
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,157
What are you doing?

223
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,411
Holding your ass.

224
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:14,663
You really didn't know?

225
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:16,531
- House... - Just trying to help you out here.

226
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:20,998
I figure for sure he'd punch me in the face,
thus proving it's a natural response.

227
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:27,172
My God, you have super-human discipline.

228
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:28,762
And glutes.

229
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:30,378
Get your hands off me.

230
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,478
Sorry.

231
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:39,421
Go.

232
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:43,791
Why... did you do that?

233
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:45,400
We have a bet.

234
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:47,931
But he's the chair of the disciplinary committee.

235
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:50,119
Forget about the bet.

236
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:53,544
You two really need to do your homework with me.

237
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:55,641
Treat the patient with activated protein c.

238
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:58,317
If he has myelodysplastic syndrome,
he'll bleed out.

239
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,311
And if he has Factor 5 Leiden deficiency,
he'll throw another clot.

240
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:03,154
Exactly.

241
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,539
It's a conclusive test.

242
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,124
There's no actual risk.

243
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,707
As long as you're both paying attention,
and are both good enough to work here.

244
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:18,389
I hear one of you thinks I'm a real bastard.

245
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,127
I guess that would be me.

246
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:24,602
Your boss uses blackmail,
and you question my professional ethics?

247
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:28,141
Will you be instituting worker safety regulations
in your new factories?

248
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:29,163
Oh, absolutely.

249
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:31,947
What about juice boxes in the break room
for the children you'll be hiring?

250
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:36,705
Charges of child exploitation
against American companies have been blown way out of proportion.

251
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,863
My ten-year-old cousin lives near Cebu City.

252
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:42,146
<i>Works at an American factory.</i>

253
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,472
I am so sorry.

254
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:45,683
It's the best thing for him.

255
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:51,019
It sucks, but the Filipino factories suck worse,
and the schools would suck if they existed.

256
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,890
So this is the family's best hope.

257
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:57,200
Are you okay?

258
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:59,105
Is this supposed to itch like this?

259
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,349
Itching.

260
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,344
Interesting.

261
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:07,414
Not interesting.

262
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:08,845
Already went away.

263
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:10,614
Doubly interesting.

264
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:13,654
Means we have to explain the arrival
and the departure.

265
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,347
That's real mature, House. What do you mean?

266
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:20,247
This is outlandishly childish.

267
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:21,500
I custom-built this puppy.

268
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:27,231
It's got 106 leds,each one sending light to your eyes,
slightly different wavelength.

269
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:31,601
Turn that off. Different wavelengths
are stimulating your autonomic nervous system.

270
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:35,130
<i>That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat</i>
in choppy waters.

271
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:42,003
Oh ho ho! Cool.

272
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,547
You think I'm not-

273
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,283
you think I'm not gonna go to Foreman with this?

274
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:51,273
Oh, you will.

275
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:54,234
And... I'll deny it,
and he'll believe you.

276
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:58,369
But then these two believe that the policy
<i>of protecting American jobs starts at home.</i>

277
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,717
So they'll never testify against me.

278
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:02,763
<i>And you won't be able to prove anything.</i>

279
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:07,807
Now, if I punched him in the face,
that he could prove.

280
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:12,746
<i>I remember you saying something about</i>
<i>how loyalty to real estate was stupid.</i>

281
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:16,013
This is about reclaiming stolen property!

282
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,996
Loyalty to real estate is stupid,
because loyalty is stupid.

283
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:22,416
First patriotism, now loyalty.

284
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,017
You hate ice cream too?

285
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:25,666
French vanilla, yeah.

286
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,199
<i>To willfully identify yourself as something else</i>
is a perversion of self-expression.

287
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,420
<i>I had a thought.</i>

288
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:35,703
<i>Other than the fact</i>
that loyalty is the basis of all meaningful relationships.

289
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:39,000
<i>The daughter said that her mother died</i>
<i>of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</i>

290
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,832
What if she was misdiagnosed?

291
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:45,173
Dutch chocolate's not bad.

292
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:46,200
Gotta give 'em that.

293
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,138
<i>Her lymphoma could have been caused by a virus,</i>

294
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:52,484
HTLV-1, which our patient contracted
through having sex with his wife.

295
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:55,700
In other words, loyalty gave him cancer.

296
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:56,677
I like it.

297
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:58,238
Start him on radiation.

298
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:03,052
Chang and Eng Bunker.

299
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:04,861
It's the most famous conjoined twins in history.

300
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,194
2011 is the bicentennial of their birth.

301
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,817
The best Halloween costumes
are always the ones that need an explanation.

302
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,490
<i>What took you so long?</i>

303
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,425
I already lost one of them.

304
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,329
You need help with the lacerations?

305
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,168
No, I think I got palliative.

306
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,320
Why don't you take preventative?

307
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:22,367
Prevent what? He got in a fight.

308
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:23,295
<i>Which he started.</i>

309
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,612
Which means he's both irascible and stupid.

310
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:28,878
I told the drunk, racist frat guy
the proper term is "conjoined twin,"

311
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,310
not "Siamese. "

312
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:33,192
I can't comment
on the drunk or the frat.

313
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:36,672
But Chang and Eng were both, in fact,
born in Siam.

314
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:38,960
And they were, in fact, twins.

315
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:42,659
If your name was Richard, it would be okay
for me to call you a Dick.

316
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:45,403
<i>But maybe some of the tripe</i>
you learn in anger management class

317
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,753
might help keep this guy out of here
<i>the next time.</i>

318
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:53,755
Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying
<i>to wind up and punch someone who really deserves it.</i>

319
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:55,466
But when you think about the consequences-

320
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:56,623
Okay, let's go.

321
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,697
I thought you wanted me to help him with his anger.

322
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:00,474
No, I got everything in need.

323
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:02,900
Sometimes... - Sometimes...

324
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:06,877
It's incredibly satisfying
to wind up and punch someone who deserves it.

325
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:09,122
Wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.

326
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:16,097
This is a waste of time.

327
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:18,905
There's no way that Robin gave me an STD.

328
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:25,184
I know this is hard, and I'm sorry
<i>about your wife.</i>

329
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:29,021
<i>If you'd like to talk to someone,</i>
we do have grief counselors at the hospital.

330
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,800
<i>You sound like my daughter.</i>

331
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:34,494
I miss my wife,
but it's not driving my decision-making.

332
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,382
You were CEO since 1988.

333
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:41,966
You decided to move your company right after your wife died.

334
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,830
<i>It stands to reason that your emotions factored in.</i>

335
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,723
My wife...

336
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:51,826
is the only thing that keeps me here.

337
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,881
I visit her grave once a week.

338
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,177
So your daughter was wrong.

339
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:06,501
You just... really need
<i>a lot of money.</i>

340
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:10,979
You ever hear of Kongo Gumi?

341
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:17,308
Construction company in Japan founded in the year 578.

342
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,580
Family-owned and operated.

343
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,779
Building Buddhist temples for 50 generations.

344
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:28,856
We-went bankrupt five years ago.

345
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:33,702
You have any idea how that last CEO must have felt?

346
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:40,443
Sorry, I... have to move.

347
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,411
Your heart rate is speeding up.

348
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:48,809
Do you feel any tightness in your chest?

349
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,880
Yes, I figured it was from the radiation.

350
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,090
I think you're having a heart attack.

351
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,118
Come in.

352
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:01,789
Dr. Wilson...

353
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:03,620
I need your advice.

354
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:06,921
Um... I bet House $100

355
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:10,110
that I wouldn't get fired
after my disciplinary hearing.

356
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:14,943
Ever since then, he's been acting like
he's actually trying to get me fired.

357
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:18,097
That's because he is actually trying to get you fired.

358
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:19,304
Does he hate me?

359
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:21,421
Not sure that's relevant to the equation.

360
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:23,559
So it's really over $100?

361
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,324
Not sure the amount is relevant.

362
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:26,622
He's fighting for his honor.

363
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:28,026
He'll ruin my career.

364
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:31,631
- Not sure that's- - What if I bet him $200

365
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:32,786
I will get fired.

366
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:36,478
He sees competing debts with the same person
as a disgrace to the game.

367
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,923
He'll be even more motivated to beat you.

368
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:44,110
If you were me, what would you do?

369
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,602
You have to give him something
he values more than honor.

370
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:54,153
And you should update your resume.

371
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,594
<i>EKG and troponins were equivocal.</i>

372
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:08,885
It's not even clear if our patient
just had a heart attack or what it was.

373
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:11,321
Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities.

374
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:13,059
Get him an echo to confirm.

375
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:15,830
I need $200,000.

376
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:20,422
His company's lost one third of its value
since he was admitted.

377
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,291
And you want to do some insider trading?

378
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,511
I take it felonies
aren't a violation of your parole?

379
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,712
It's not insider trading.

380
00:19:26,713 --> 00:19:29,024
Just betting on myself to solve the case.

381
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,971
Once we cure him, share price goes up,
I pay you back.

382
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,065
No.

383
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,471
No, you don't say "no. "

384
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,121
You... make a counter offer.

385
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,811
I'm not loaning my boss money.

386
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,426
Fine. I'll make you a counter.

387
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:43,528
$100,000.

388
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:45,531
$20,000.

389
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,815
I'll buy options instead of shares.

390
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:48,033
More risk, but more upside.

391
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:50,218
But that's as low as I'm gonna go.

392
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,272
I could do $5,000.

393
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:54,907
Really? No backsies.

394
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:57,910
If... you double your clinic hours.

395
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,615
Six a week.

396
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,047
I've seen how you disrespect those patients.

397
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:04,049
So you want twice as many of them disrespected?

398
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,086
Spend more hours with them,

399
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,070
you'll treat them more humanely.

400
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:14,310
And this time, a land war in Russia
will be a good idea.

401
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,161
Deal?

402
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,514
Here's what I'm thinking.

403
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:22,735
You went to a parole hearing,
where one of your old patients was denied.

404
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,770
Hence the attire, hence the tardiness.

405
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:27,489
And, most important, hence the anger.

406
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,200
You think you can restore the cosmic balance
by doing extra good here.

407
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:38,583
More annoyingly, by having me do it
and deal!

408
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:06,106
Of course, you know... this means war.

409
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:07,245
Oh, I know.

410
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,546
I mean, you'll escalate,
and then I'll retaliate,

411
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:13,576
and the cycle will continue
until we've both gone too far,

412
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:20,503
at which point, I'll... maybe get suspended
and... you'll go back to prison.

413
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,106
Happy pranking.

414
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:36,674
<i>Patient had V-tach in the echo lab,</i>
<i>so we capped him, but...</i>

415
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:38,210
coronary arteries were clean.

416
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,880
If the plumbing's fine,
check the electrical.

417
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,100
EP study.

418
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:45,434
Nice idea.

419
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:48,053
Even has a metaphor in it.

420
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,421
Not worth more than my honor.

421
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:51,423
But delightful, all the same.

422
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,018
<i>I'm not going to lose.</i>

423
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:58,263
My college roommate is the editor
<i>of the Yale Law Review.</i>

424
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:00,666
She's writing my opening statement.

425
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,768
You will be eloquent in your loss.

426
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:04,903
This case boils down to he said, she said.

427
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:09,008
He said, "I've been working at this hospital for 15 years
and I'm taking self-improvement classes. "

428
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:12,198
She said, "I've been a fellow for two months,
and I'm kind of weird. "

429
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:17,073
No, he said, "I'm a drunk idiot
"who thinks he can grab girls' behinds without ramifications. "

430
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:18,450
Wait, he was drunk?

431
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:21,520
<i>- In the hospital? - I already told Foreman</i>
he'd been drinking that night.

432
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:25,370
Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes,
not AA.

433
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:30,296
That means he didn't get in trouble for drinking.

434
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:35,668
Which means that Foreman signed off on it,
which means that he set all the wheels in motion.

435
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:40,072
Forget that. Wild speculation.

436
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:42,390
Go do the EP study.

437
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:52,518
You already knew Andrews was drinking that night,
didn't you?

438
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,886
Yes.

439
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:57,322
I think you should cancel my hearing.

440
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:01,643
I hope this isn't going where I assume it's going.

441
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:02,794
You're the one who brought Andrews in.

442
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:05,897
You set the wheels in motion.

443
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:15,190
We had a patient who was going to die
without an AVM embolization.

444
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:18,877
Andrews... was the only neurologist I could reach.

445
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:21,947
He told me had a few glasses of wine,
and that he shouldn't do it,

446
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:24,494
but he also said that you were good.

447
00:23:24,495 --> 00:23:27,753
You were ready to do one, as long as you were supervised.

448
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:31,256
So we agreed that he would come in,
but wouldn't touch the patient.

449
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:33,625
I can understand the rationalization.

450
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:37,523
We'll see if the Board agrees
when I tell them the whole story at my hearing.

451
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,961
I already did

452
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:44,737
I had a closed session hearing last week.

453
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:47,271
The Board decided to dock me two weeks pay.

454
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:55,514
Been working for House for two weeks.

455
00:23:55,515 --> 00:23:57,415
It's already too long.

456
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,241
No sign of any electrical abnormalities
in the right atrium.

457
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,627
I'm so dead.

458
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:11,396
I- I think House set me up.

459
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:16,001
<i>Have you sent</i>
the committee a character reference for me?

460
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:17,150
I thought you don't like favors.

461
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,204
I don't like gifts. It wouldn't be a gift.

462
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:21,610
I would just be you telling the truth.

463
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:23,708
I hardly know you.

464
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,513
O2 sat is 89.

465
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,181
<i>Did we perforate? Is he tamponading?</i>

466
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:30,930
Heart rate's only 90. Neck veins are flat.

467
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:33,535
Then why isn't he saturated?

468
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:39,615
<i>Seems healthy to me.</i>

469
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,430
Let's release him.

470
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:47,050
My option to sell Barton Foods at $34
is about to expire.

471
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,135
So they thought the patient would be better by now.

472
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:52,872
Instead, I am going to lose $20,000.

473
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:54,057
20?

474
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,926
Your five plus the five I stole from Wilson.

475
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,595
<i>Plus the ten I got on margin.</i>

476
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,462
<i>You're gonna have to talk to my bankruptcy attorney.</i>

477
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:02,982
Unless...

478
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:05,902
There is a way that you can get your money back.

479
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:08,204
Give me the full $200,000.

480
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:13,893
And extrapolating,
tomorrow you'll owe just shy of $1 million.

481
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:15,394
It's your own fault.

482
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:16,830
You forced me to go with the options here.

483
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:20,785
Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances.

484
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,502
Regular stock this time, nice and safe.

485
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:23,903
I'm not angry.

486
00:25:23,904 --> 00:25:25,255
I don't know if you're trying to make me angry.

487
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:26,589
You refuse to bet on yourself.

488
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,208
That means low self-esteem.

489
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:31,211
So if I give you $200,000,
I'll feel smart and pretty.

490
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:35,465
Low self-esteem can be brought on
by exposure to one's relatives.

491
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:37,016
Nice clothes and anger...

492
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:38,384
Classic symptoms.

493
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,752
Family gathering.

494
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:45,493
You were late the other day
'cause you were having breakfast with grammy Adams or cousin Itt.

495
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:48,083
And she was nagging you about finding a husband.

496
00:25:48,084 --> 00:25:49,863
All right, this is getting annoying.

497
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,714
I'll just tell you what I was-

498
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:54,484
No spoilers.

499
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,473
They ruin everything.

500
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,371
Pulmonology was that way.

501
00:25:58,372 --> 00:26:00,373
Our patient's lung problem is not a lung problem.

502
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:01,991
It's a brain problem.

503
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:03,142
We're consulting with Neurology.

504
00:26:03,142 --> 00:26:03,878
Mark Andrews,M.D.

505
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:05,712
<i>That's my old boss.</i>

506
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:07,664
You don't actually think this is neurological.

507
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:09,295
I don't know what it is.

508
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:15,521
<i>Maybe I should just</i>
accept the patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.

509
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,725
Dr. Andrews.

510
00:26:18,726 --> 00:26:19,893
<i>My associates.</i>

511
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:22,661
Doctors Adams and Park.

512
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:28,726
Ah. Nice to meet you, Dr. Adams.

513
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:32,110
Hello, Dr. Park.

514
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:35,783
You two know each other?

515
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,772
It's a small world.

516
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:44,134
Dr. Park, maybe you'll like to update
our esteemed colleague on the condition of our patient.

517
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:53,475
Micropsia, bleeding,
tachycardia, and difficulty breathing.

518
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:56,562
Cute butt, huh?

519
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:59,118
Can we go now?

520
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,500
You really wanna turn your back on this guy?

521
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,721
Sorry. Carry on.

522
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,839
Uh... Well...

523
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,538
It sounds like there could be
spinal cord involvement.

524
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,402
Have you considered normal pressure hydrocephalus?

525
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,401
Okay, normal pressure hydrocephalus going once.

526
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:20,286
Normal pressure hydrocephalus going twice...

527
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:25,158
It's not his spinal cord,
it's the wiring between his heart and his brain.

528
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,794
Autonomic dysregulation syndrome.

529
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:30,663
You do a tilt table test,
see how his heart rate responds.

530
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:32,065
That'll confirm.

531
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:36,169
Well, if he has normal pressure hydrocephalus,
a tilt table test could put him in a coma.

532
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,038
Then it's a good thing he has A.D.S.

533
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:42,208
Do you really believe in this diagnosis?

534
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:45,812
Because if this is just a pissing contest,
you are at a severe anatomical disadvantage.

535
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:48,187
It's autonomic dysregulation syndrome.

536
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:51,684
No... it's normal pressure hydrocephalus.

537
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:54,019
<i>Do a spinal fluid test to confirm.</i>

538
00:27:55,522 --> 00:27:57,561
We're doing the tilt table.

539
00:27:57,562 --> 00:27:58,574
That makes sense.

540
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:00,576
You'd rather have House fire you than Foreman?

541
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:01,744
This bet's got to be a test.

542
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,471
See if I can handle working with him.

543
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:08,418
I need to prove I have the confidence to disobey him.

544
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:11,371
Do you have any medical justification for your diagnosis?

545
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:14,624
The symptoms fit, and Andrews is a hack.

546
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,725
Do you think I'm right?

547
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,062
Let's go.

548
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:25,990
No... you need to go prepare for your hearing.

549
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:36,412
15 more minutes, Mr. Barton.

550
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:39,698
A skin resurfacing laser is missing.

551
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:41,401
And why are you asking me about it?

552
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:42,935
Because you work for House.

553
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:45,422
What would House want with a skin resurfacing laser?

554
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,774
I have no idea. Have you seen it?

555
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:49,605
<i>My feet feel hot.</i>

556
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:52,378
That's completely normal.

557
00:28:52,725 --> 00:28:57,145
No, but House has been talking about
how badly he wants to remove those prison tats.

558
00:28:57,146 --> 00:29:00,060
It's a very expensive machine,
and I'd like it back.

559
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:01,918
Please tell me if you hear anything.

560
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,096
How expensive?
$200,000.

561
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:11,266
He took it.

562
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:12,466
I have no idea.

563
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:14,422
Park's hearing's about to start.

564
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:16,278
You're covering for him.

565
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,971
<i>I did the same thing many times.</i>

566
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:21,733
My advice to you- figure out what line
you aren't willing to cross for him.

567
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:24,342
Because, eventually, he'll ask you to cross it.

568
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:33,819
How are your feet?

569
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:37,806
<i>Mr. Barton?</i>

570
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:42,587
Can you hear me, Mr. Barton?

571
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:47,871
Oh, no.

572
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:54,668
We have convened the disciplinary committee
to decide the appropriate action that should be taken

573
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:59,652
against Dr. Chi Park as a result of her actions
on October 7th of this year.

574
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,136
Dr. Park, do you have an opening statement.

575
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:08,242
Dr. Foreman, members of the committee,
thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today, I...

576
00:30:09,228 --> 00:30:10,377
Good news.

577
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:11,512
<i>You can cancel the hearing.</i>

578
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:12,597
'Cause I'm firing her myself.

579
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:13,931
She's not yours to fire.

580
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:17,885
You guys better fire her for insubordination,
'cause she went rogue, and my patient is now in a coma.

581
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:18,853
I'm the one who did the test.

582
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:20,188
<i>No, it was my idea!</i>

583
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:21,272
Seriously, House?

584
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:23,658
At least I'm smart enough
to know what I don't know.

585
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:25,193
<i>She went out of her way to defy me!</i>

586
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:28,157
<i>She needs-damn it, you should just fire her!</i>

587
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:29,627
My apologies.

588
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,239
<i>My apologies, Dr. Park.</i>

589
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:38,142
Dr. House's comments
<i>will, of course, have no bearing on this hearing.

590
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:40,603
Please continue.

591
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,948
I, uh... I can't believe you did that.

592
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:49,603
Right back at ya.

593
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:52,236
Our patient's dying. We need theories.

594
00:30:52,237 --> 00:30:54,433
It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus.

595
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:56,301
Andrews predicted the coma.

596
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:58,750
Yeah, but even a broken doctor's right twice a day.

597
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,053
Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky.

598
00:31:01,054 --> 00:31:02,925
Coma had to be a lucky guess.

599
00:31:03,465 --> 00:31:08,023
If you didn't think he was right,
then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?

600
00:31:08,024 --> 00:31:10,394
I didn't. I wanted you to do a tilt table test.

601
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:12,540
You have a wonderful way of communicating.

602
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,300
I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table.

603
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:15,854
She listens to me, I waste an hour.

604
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:17,295
If she defies me...

605
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:20,762
Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks.

606
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:22,220
Up high.

607
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:25,702
You're an ass.
You're angry.

608
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:27,841
Yes! Now I'm angry.

609
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:30,979
Let's run the test for normal pressure hydrocephalus.

610
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:32,300
No.

611
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,915
What else would explain our symptoms
and make our patient go into a coma during that test?

612
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:40,155
How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?

613
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:41,766
No, we already tested his liver enzymes.

614
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,116
They're normal.

615
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,977
Or his liver's so far gone
it can't even produce enzymes.

616
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:47,584
That's desperate.

617
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:49,684
Fits the symptoms.

618
00:31:49,963 --> 00:31:51,826
And Andrews is a hack.

619
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,644
Go biopsy to confirm.

620
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:55,658
Unless you want your own hearing.

621
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,403
You'd have to hire me first.

622
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,988
<i>Nurse Williams to social services.</i>

623
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:03,383
<i>Nurse Williams to social services.</i>

624
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:07,245
<i>So you do realize</i>
<i>that it is unacceptable to hit someone</i>

625
00:32:07,246 --> 00:32:08,188
in the workplace?

626
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:10,704
<i>Yes, completely unacceptable.</i>

627
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:11,816
I wasn't thinking.

628
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:15,933
I guess, I mean- yes, technically,
I was thinking.

629
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,911
I just... It happened so fast,
<i>I did-I-</i>

630
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,918
<i>I...</i>

631
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:23,298
It's like...

632
00:32:23,784 --> 00:32:25,436
It's like it wasn't even me.

633
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:28,970
I would never do something like that.

634
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:30,639
Even though I did.

635
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,646
I'm sorry, I'm not making any sense right now.

636
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:36,449
I, um...

637
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:39,036
I don't know, I...

638
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:41,715
Just really love being a doctor so much.

639
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:46,296
And I barely even have $100 and...

640
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,478
Please don't fire me.

641
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,292
<i>Is this theory more promising than the others?</i>

642
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:02,499
We'll know in a few hours.

643
00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:05,541
How are you holding up?

644
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,152
Other than the fact that my dad's in a coma...

645
00:33:10,116 --> 00:33:11,268
Terrible.

646
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:15,792
Tomorrow morning, I am supposed to sign
a piece of paper that will...

647
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:20,191
move the company
and cost thousands of employees their jobs.

648
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:24,777
I thought you'd rather see the company
go under in New Jersey than thrive in China.

649
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:27,626
It's what my dad wants.

650
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:29,057
<i>And it's still his company.</i>

651
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:30,894
I'm really just keeping the seat warm.

652
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,109
But unless he wakes up before tomorrow,
it's gonna be my signature on that piece of paper.

653
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:46,375
You don't have to sign it.

654
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,627
I'll let you know when we have the results.

655
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:14,040
Biopsy was clean. It's not his liver.

656
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:18,350
I also ran the spinal fluid test,
and you were right that Andrews was wrong.

657
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:21,297
His ICP was not normal. It was elevated.

658
00:34:22,212 --> 00:34:23,904
What about HTLV?

659
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,535
We ruled that out three days ago.

660
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:27,018
Because of his heart problems, but-

661
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:30,800
Once something gets taken off the board,
I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.

662
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:38,678
You owe me 106,804 won.

663
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,315
Or $100 U.S.

664
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,788
God, but you're petty.

665
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:48,051
Okay, so... two options.

666
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:53,099
Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy,
or we figure out how to make this company profitable in New Jersey.

667
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,046
Eastern equine encephalitis?

668
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,310
Thinking in here!

669
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:02,411
<i>Brain scans indicate</i>
it could be Loa loa disease.

670
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:05,448
Ah, shut it off!

671
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:20,208
Apparently we're allowed to do this now.

672
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,852
Get out of here, House!

673
00:35:31,144 --> 00:35:33,871
Start the patient on plasmapheresis.

674
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,116
He'll wake up in an hour.

675
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:42,847
It's been a pleasure having you in the neighborhood.

676
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:58,664
This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter "y. "

677
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:01,553
Dad...
God, you're okay.

678
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:04,190
I'm thirsty.

679
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:08,413
That's a side effect of not dying.

680
00:36:09,038 --> 00:36:11,879
<i>Turns out your blood was getting thick and syrupy.</i>

681
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,805
<i>Complexes of large, y- shaped antibodies</i>
were clogging up your blood vessels,

682
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:19,516
causing your organs to shut down one by one.

683
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:24,819
Now, usually with hyperviscosity syndrome,
it's caused by an elevated blood count or protein count.

684
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,441
Yours eluded us
'cause it was caused by antibodies from your rheumatoid arthritis.

685
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:32,487
Now that they're being filtered out,
the blood would be...

686
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,228
A little less duck sauce

687
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:36,297
and a little more soy sauce.

688
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:39,350
So I'm gonna be completely cured.

689
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:41,592
It's not all about you.

690
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:43,329
<i>Your stock price</i>

691
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,882
will be completely cured.

692
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,419
Once you sign this.

693
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,493
It's a press release.

694
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:53,871
It says that you're healthy, you're going back to work,
and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to China.

695
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,206
<i>He just woke up.</i>

696
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:57,041
Dad, you don't have to deal with this right now.

697
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,553
Ah, mm, yeah, actually...

698
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:00,263
He does.

699
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:02,253
<i>'Cause the market opens at 9:00 a. m.</i>

700
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,026
And this means a lot to me.

701
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:08,202
You may remember me
from the time I saved your life.

702
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,375
If you move it, it'll be without me.

703
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:21,349
I know you object.

704
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,350
I know you disagree with-

705
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:24,152
Dad...

706
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:26,554
I can't do it.

707
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:33,194
If this is really about family,
you will not do this.

708
00:38:22,522 --> 00:38:23,933
Morning.

709
00:38:27,426 --> 00:38:28,877
Got lucky this time.

710
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:29,990
No, you didn't.

711
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:34,178
I made this bet so you'd stop
actively trying to fire Park so you'd be neutral.

712
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,260
You went out of your way to help her.

713
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:40,654
She obviously earned your respect,
passed whatever test you-I sabotaged her hearing.

714
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:42,902
You do read the school paper, don't you?

715
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:46,567
If you had sabotaged her hearing,
she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist.

716
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:50,655
What you actually did was make her emotional
and make the board members see her as a victim.

717
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:54,180
'Cause the panel feels badly
for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.

718
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:56,579
You know that everyone on that panel hates you.

719
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,941
You know the minute you recommend firing anyone,
they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.

720
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:03,343
That's just hurtful.

721
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:09,027
The fact is, winning $100 from you
gives me more pleasure than winning $100 from her.

722
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:11,885
Here's your five grand.

723
00:39:14,096 --> 00:39:15,729
What five grand?

724
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:19,750
Just take it. Trust me.

725
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:27,491
Found her sleeping in the park.

726
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:31,036
Said she ran away because her daddy didn't love her.

727
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,170
And that is exactly what happened...

728
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,796
as far as you can prove.

729
00:39:34,797 --> 00:39:36,125
Congratulations.

730
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,293
You're not going to jail... Today.

731
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:41,123
But you do know
I just can't let this slide.

732
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:42,901
You need to keep up your rep.

733
00:39:43,597 --> 00:39:45,619
Fine. Clinic hours.

734
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,682
I'll double them.

735
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:48,659
Okay. 12 hours a week.

736
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,322
No...

737
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:52,042
Three times two equals six.

738
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:55,207
And 3 times 2 times 2 is 12.

739
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:57,652
I know about your deal with Adams.

740
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:05,480
Call Chase and Taub.

741
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:07,385
Get 'em in here.

742
00:40:07,386 --> 00:40:09,042
The boys are back.

743
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:16,259
This check is for significantly more
than what I told you it would take to fund the department.

744
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,448
I know.

745
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:29,703
You paged me?

746
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:48,940
Congratulations.

747
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:57,027
You caught your boyfriend cheating that morning.

748
00:40:57,926 --> 00:40:59,429
You had a big fight.

749
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:01,421
That's why you were late.

750
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:06,323
You re-pitched an S.T.D.

751
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:09,780
You haven't gotten two consecutive minutes
without using the word "loyalty,"

752
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:14,369
which explains the anger and the low self-esteem,
and the desire to feel pretty...

753
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,034
After having been rejected explains the clothes.

754
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:24,207
It wasn't my boyfriend.

755
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:26,271
It was my husband.

756
00:41:27,113 --> 00:41:30,079
I was at my lawyer's office signing the divorce papers.

757
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:36,481
I missed the fact that you were married.

758
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:38,564
We've been separated for almost a year.

759
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:43,011
So... old news?

760
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:44,676
No anger left?

761
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,498
It's all bought and paid for.

762
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,561
<i>Morning has broken</i>

763
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:37,549
<i>like the first morning</i>

764
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:41,687
<i>blackbird has spoken</i>

00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:45,674
