1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,080
<i>Clear!</i>

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,690
<i>Charging! Clear!</i>

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,140
Okay, I'm calling it.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,590
Time of death...

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,220
8:32.

6
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,390
Hello, Diana.

7
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,090
Shall we?

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,920
LV tear is within a zone of fresh tissue necrosis,

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,930
implicating a recent myocardial infarction as the instigating event.

10
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,670
Unfortunately, the medical records show

11
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,030
that Dr. Penza never suspected heart disease,

12
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,930
instead giving steroids for an erroneous diagnosis

13
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,640
of asthma, thereby causing the fatal tear.

14
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,000
<i>I suggest these findings warrant further investigation</i>

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,360
into Dr. Penza's standard of care for this patient,

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,500
<i>making this my...</i>

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,030
third such recommendation regarding Dr. Penza this year.

18
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,860
Concluding autopsy with examination of the brain.

19
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,200
Dr. Treiber...

20
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm cold.

24
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,520
Yes, it's mine.

25
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,850
And yes, I know that I can't drive stick.

26
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,490
And no, I don't care that I parked in a handicapped spot.

27
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,430
<i>"Staring death in the face</i> has changed my life. "

28
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,510
What a cliche.

29
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,800
The cliche is to lead a more meaningful life.

30
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,430
I've taken a holy vow to lead a less meaningful one.

31
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,820
I've spent my life caring, giving, and searching for the profound.

32
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,810
Now it's time for selfishness, indifference,

33
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,350
and embracing the shallow.

34
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,390
Your scan's in three days.

35
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,880
Tell me this isn't just you killing time until you find out if your cancer's gonna kill it for you.

36
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,300
I just paid $75,000 for a ridiculously impractical car,

37
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,210
the depth of shallowness.

38
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,300
And tomorrow, I'm driving it to Cleveland to meet my boyhood crush.

39
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,030
The years have not been kind to David Cassidy.

40
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,590
<i>Julie Christie. Dr. Zhivago, Shampoo.</i> I was precocious.

41
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,480
She's opening some kind of charity animal clinic or something.

42
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm neglecting my patients to fulfill a silly fantasy.

43
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,510
Textbook selfishness and indifference.

44
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,370
Or you've made sure that your patients are well-covered, car is a rental,

45
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,220
and while waiting to get Julie Christie's autograph, you'll adopt a puppy.

46
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,670
I don't even care whether you believe me or not.

47
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,570
Indifference.

48
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,450
He tried to cut open his own skull.

49
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,400
Head CT and tox screen were clean. Interesting.

50
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,570
Cotard delusion.

51
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,900
Also known as "walking corpse syndrome. "

52
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,510
Disconnect in the amygdala convinces you that you're secretly dead.

53
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,440
Case solved. <i>Rendering it...</i>

54
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
What's the past-tense of "interesting?"

55
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,310
No prior history of mental illness, and before you say it was caused by antivirals,

56
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,780
I've already ruled that out. Plus, Cotard's doesn't explain the paresthesia in his hand.

57
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,310
Also...

58
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,550
Treiber won't let any other doctor near him.

59
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,160
He trusts your work.

60
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,900
Treiber's the patient?

61
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,570
What's the future tense of "interesting"?

62
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,090
How's Wilson doing? Wilson's scan is at the end of the week.

63
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,350
<i>If his kick-ass chemo shrunk the tumor to an operable size,</i>

64
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,420
<i>he'll live.</i> If it didn't, he'll die.

65
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,120
That must be very hard. <i>Is there anything we can do?</i>

66
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,230
Other than the prayer circle, what is there?

67
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,490
<i>Patient's AST is high.</i>

68
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,720
<i>Psychosis could be brought on by liver failure.</i>

69
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,040
<i>Maybe Hep C?</i>
Bilirubin and serum protein levels were normal.

70
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,060
Doesn't explain the tingly hand or why Chase hates him.

71
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,910
I don't hate him. He hates me.

72
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,140
He hates all doctors, and it's mutual. He only hates the ones that screw up.

73
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,650
And you.

74
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,890
And they only hate Treiber because he finds their mistakes.

75
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,940
Mistakes are a wee bit easier to find on a dead patient, a distinction he fails to recognize.

76
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,750
He's a rat.

77
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,440
Who makes the hospital a safer place by keeping doctors accountable

78
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,550
and focused. What if he got something from a cadaver?

79
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,270
He handles a lot of 'em. You suggesting we DDX them all?

80
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,760
No, just his last one. She had bad knees.

81
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,330
<i>She used dimethyl sulfoxide for joint pain.</i>

82
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,810
Current from the defibrillator could've converted it <i>to dimethyl sulfate. When Treiber cut into her,</i>

83
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,680
her blood released toxic fumes. Everyone in the basement would be sick.

84
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,940
Gas would've dissipated quickly.

85
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,240
His lungs are fine. Blood clots make more sense.

86
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,380
One in his hand explains the paresthesia,

87
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,200
<i>one in his carotid explains the psychotic episode.</i>

88
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,880
You two look for toxic exposure.

89
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,840
Adams, you can help Chase ultrasound

90
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,960
his evil nemesis for evil clots.

91
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,260
I know House doesn't like seeing his patients, but doesn't a fellow doctor rate an exception?

92
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,250
Psychosis appears to be intermittent.

93
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,690
Just snapped out of it long enough to ask if House actually ordered this test.

94
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,650
Don't worry. We're simply carrying out his direct orders.

95
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,180
<i>Right. Forgot.</i>
It's what you were hired to do.

96
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,580
<i>Which is fine, his diagnostic error metric</i> is. 17 compared to the hospital average of. 32.

97
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,960
You actually think you can quantify the value of every doctor?

98
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,020
<i>Someone should.</i> And since I'm the only one who sees everything-

99
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,200
Right, you were hired to diagnose people after they're already dead.

100
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,540
No sign of stenosis or clots.

101
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,650
Every doctor, every diagnosis, every treatment, every result.

102
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,300
It's pretty impressive. It's pretty Orwellian.

103
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,200
All written in his secret code. He has to keep it confidential.

104
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,820
Just like the Wannsee conference.

105
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,440
The "Big Brother" metaphor wasn't pointed enough for you?

106
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,160
You had to throw in Hitler?

107
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,780
A couple years ago,
he noticed a link in child deaths,

108
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,580
and it's completely changed hospital policies all over-

109
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,830
I get it. Treiber is nerd king.

110
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,750
The more people we kill, the more lives he saves.

111
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,180
Test is negative for dimethyl sulfate,

112
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,320
her blood is not toxic.

113
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,890
Then we should look for toxic exposure from something else.

114
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,520
You really think the hospital is idiotic enough <i>to issue toxic supplies?</i>

115
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,110
Have you seen his tools?

116
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,660
Treiber doesn't always use hospital-issue. Then he's the idiot?

117
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,470
<i>No, but I don't want</i> to explain that assumption to House.

118
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,590
Found something.

119
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,360
Thought we'd make it a road trip.

120
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,860
'80s music, junk food, beer.
I have a dental appointment.

121
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,180
That I'm going to make now. Ah. I'll let you drive.

122
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,830
Not worth listening to you whine about your feelings and fears for three days.

123
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,550
It's not gonna happen. I've taken a vow.

124
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,400
People don't change. You are a person, ergo, pass.

125
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,370
Yes, that's why I brought this.

126
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,630
20 CCs of propofol. <i>You can accompany me willingly,</i>

127
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,320
<i>or I will, when you least expect it,</i>

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,550
inject the contents of this vial into your bloodstream.

129
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,980
<i>The fall might result in a concussion,</i> or fractures,

130
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,370
or you might get lucky and simply wake up somewhere near Allentown <i>with a nasty headache.</i>

131
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,590
<i>The choice is yours, and in case you've forgotten,</i> I am indifferent.

132
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,720
We leave tomorrow morning at 8:00 a. m.

133
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,390
No clots. No gas.

134
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,730
But we found enough of this <i>to reanimate the entire morgue.</i>

135
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,510
He's jacked on caffeine.

136
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,690
<i>Stimulant psychosis.</i>

137
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,810
How many times do I have to solve this case?

138
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,940
So all we have to do is hydrate and observe him for 24 hours.

139
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,430
Why don't you tell him it was your idea? He might warm up to you.

140
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,670
If you get an ear in the mail, it's probably mine.

141
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,530
<i>My abdomen!</i>

142
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,340
It's my abdomen! It's just the effects of withdrawal.

143
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,360
The pain is normal.
No! No!

144
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,910
This isn't right!

145
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,120
Abdominal pain and distention means we were wrong about stimulant psychosis.

146
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,700
It could be coexistent problems.
He might just have an obstruction.

147
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,600
You know what House says about coincidences.

148
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,210
I didn't feel any masses when I examined him, and no bowel sounds.

149
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,670
Where's House? He hasn't come in yet, and neither has Wilson.

150
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,240
I've already tried them three times. Here we go again.

151
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,130
Diabetes could cause nerve damage in his hand,
and guts, and-

152
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,670
<i>Except his glucose levels are normal,</i> 
and he probably would've mentioned he was a diabetic.

153
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,410
What about ulcerative colitis?
Earlier attacks caused thrombosis-

154
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,000
We already looked for clots, and there was no blood in his stool.

155
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,790
Try him again.

156
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,360
And Wilson's.

157
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,260
Wherever they are, they don't want to be disturbed.

158
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:19,410
 We take 78, we can do the "sweet treats and salty eats snack food trail. "

159
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,310
My trip, my itinerary.

160
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,110
<i>We have to cover 300 miles today</i> to be there with plenty of time

161
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,300
to catch Julie by 4:00 tomorrow.

162
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,580
And that thing I said about letting you drive, I lied.

163
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,020
What?

164
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,720
I'm-I'm impressed. Not by that.

165
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,600
But by your real effort to maintain the facade.

166
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,680
It's been almost an hour,

167
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,050
and there's been no mention of the elephant in the car.

168
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,800
Well, I declined the elephant option.

169
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,490
In three days, you're gonna find out if you live or die.

170
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,910
You don't want to talk about it. No, but obviously you do.

171
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,070
So, we're gonna talk about it, but because I want to.

172
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,460
I am neither talking about it,
<i>nor talking about not talking about it.</i>

173
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,980
You are hard-wired to talk about it.

174
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,180
It's how you cope, it's who you are.

175
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,610
<i>Yeah, well,</i> from now on, I'm not me.

176
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,390
I'm... I'm...

177
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,960
Kyle Calloway.

178
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,060
I thought your porn name was Rusty Packard.

179
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,040
Kyle is roguish, carefree,

180
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,750
and shares no qualities with James Wilson.

181
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,330
Can Kyle drive stick?

182
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,450
Treiber won't let us do anything without House.

183
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,760
House just took himself off the case. You said no bowel sounds when you examined him.

184
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,410
"No" like diminished, or none at all?

185
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,210
- None. - You think it's an intussusception?

186
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,830
If it is, it could mean cancer's behind everything.

187
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,200
Let's get a plain film of his abdomen.

188
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,610
Treiber will refuse any procedure that wasn't ordered by House.

189
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,300
Only if he knows it wasn't.

190
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,640
You want to lie to a guy whose favorite pastime is getting doctors fired.

191
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,140
We're adults with advanced medical training, not children left alone with scissors.

192
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,620
It's one X-ray.

193
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
OLYMPUS

194
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,300
<i>If we had a phone,</i>

195
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,210
we could've found somewhere a little less charming.

196
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,720
If we had a phone, you'd be making calls, <i>downloading porn, and playing Angry Birds.</i>

197
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,390
This trip is about me, and I like this place.

198
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,260
This is not about you not wanting me to have a phone. You're weak.

199
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,120
<i>You knew that you'd backslide</i>

200
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,680
and spend your time talking to teary ex-wives and your parents,

201
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,530
<i>trying to make them feel better about you being sick.</i>

202
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,470
Bacon burger with fries looks awful.

203
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,780
I'll have that.

204
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,260
I'll have the Big One.

205
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,290
You sure? It's $79.

206
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,450
Unless I finish it in an hour, <i>in which case, it's free.</i>

207
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,940
It's an 80-ounce steak. I'm hungry. And an iced tea, please.

208
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,550
Big One's up!

209
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,190
This place doesn't take credit cards.

210
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,140
My meal is going to be free,

211
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,600
and I'm going to be inducted into the wall of pain.

212
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,910
HOME OF THE BIG ONE

213
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,240
Hello, Kyle.

214
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,300
Belly film was normal. No sign of an intussusception or any other obstruction.

215
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,600
House says it's there.

216
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,870
Sometimes House is wrong. Run my bowel.

217
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,020
That's serious surgery. General anesthesia, long recovery...

218
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,290
We can do a contrast enema if you need more proof.

219
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,510
I have drawers filled with people who had clean scans.

220
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,920
I know how easy it is to miss something
<i>unless you use your own hands and eyes; Run my bowel.</i>

221
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,170
We'll let House know how you feel.

222
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,150
How I feel is twisted in white-hot agony.

223
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,470
His orders were to look for an intussusception.

224
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,470
<i>Until you actually do that, I refuse any other tests.</i>

225
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,400
Fine. Uh, no. Not fine. We need to talk-

226
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,520
And I want you to do the surgery.

227
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,370
Statistically, you're the best surgeon in the hospital.

228
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,710
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle!

229
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,920
Come on, you got this!
You got this!

230
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
<i>Come on!</i>
25 seconds.

231
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,070
You've got this.

232
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,350
Come on, home stretch, Kyle, home stretch!
15 seconds!

233
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,340
Now, don't chew, just swallow.

234
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,900
Muscle it down!
Six, five...

235
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,930
Four...

236
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,820
For the love of God, swallow! Three, two, one...

237
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,420
Time!

238
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,800
Yes! Yes!

239
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,350
Oh, you magnificent bastard!

240
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,500
<i>Yeah. Smile!</i>

241
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,690
That still counts, though, right?

242
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,510
SURGICAL UNIT
SURGERY

243
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,370
No hard feelings, right? You'll find out when you wake up.

244
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,460
If you really think I'm a good doctor, why do you treat me like an idiot?

245
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,770
It's not because you lack talent.

246
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,480
<i>It's 'cause you've wasted it.</i>

247
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,660
Did you know I applied to be a fellow with House the same year as you?

248
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,820
No.

249
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,340
Quit my other program, relocated,

250
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,210
broke up with my girlfriend.

251
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,130
Then your father made a call, and suddenly you had the spot.

252
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,340
That was almost ten years ago.

253
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,510
Do you know what I could've done after even three years with House?

254
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,110
Gone to the CDC, W.H.O.

255
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,470
Started a diagnostics department someplace they'd never even heard of such a thing.

256
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,650
You've been given everything.

257
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,680
<i>Looks, talent,</i>

258
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,710
my future.

259
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,570
Nine years later, look what you've done with it.

260
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,970
Must be nice to be puking for the old-fashioned reasons.

261
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm glad I did it.

262
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,100
You see those people out there cheering for me? I was a hero.

263
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,620
For one fleeting moment, for an incredibly stupid reason,

264
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,190
for a bunch of morons I'll never see again.

265
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,000
God, it felt good.

266
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,790
And now, if you'll excuse me.

267
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,470
I think I've made room for dessert.

268
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,630
How long do you think you'll work for House?

269
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,370
As long as he lets me. When House was in prison,

270
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,140
you worked at Mercy in plastics, right?

271
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,670
Know what I did?

272
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,790
Surfed. For nine months.

273
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,320
Yes, and if I didn't have two daughters and alimony, I might have done the same.

274
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,230
A fellowship's supposed to train you to stand on your own.

275
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,090
Foreman's Dean of the hospital, Cameron's head of emergency medicine in Chicago.

276
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,000
And Kutner and Amber are dead,

277
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,610
and Thirteen is having sweet, sapphic sex on some island.

278
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,450
Look at this. The small intestine.

279
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,210
Is it an intussusception?

280
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,070
No.

281
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,140
Guess Treiber was right.

282
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,250
He hasn't checked his voicemail.
Or his email.

283
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,130
It's been almost 24 hours.

284
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,280
<i>Shouldn't we call Foreman or the police?</i> <i>I think this makes him a fugitive.</i>

285
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,400
We don't have to tell anyone.

286
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,620
Treiber's symptoms started in his frontal lobe,

287
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,480
and moved through his nervous system, hands, bowels, muscles.

288
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,820
<i>Intermittent porphyria. He's in the middle of an attack.</i>

289
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,060
The longer we wait to treat with hemin, <i>the more damage it causes.</i>

290
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,650
The longer we wait to tell him House isn't running the case,
the more damage that causes.

291
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,550
<i>It's fraud.</i>

292
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,150
It's only an issue if we're wrong.

293
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,610
It's more than one X-ray.

294
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,080
More than exploratory surgery, even.

295
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,640
This is a drug that will damage him if you're wrong.

296
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
Same principle.

297
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,310
 I want a threesome. Shouldn't we try a twosome first?

298
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,780
Two women.

299
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,490
<i>Oh. I know they're probably overrated,</i>

300
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,280
and I'll probably be gravely disappointed, but I want one anyway.

301
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,940
No, you don't. Well, Kyle wants one.

302
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,660
Kyle's only one day old. He doesn't know what he wants.

303
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,040
I don't want to think about consequences.

304
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,200
I don't want to think about-

305
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,360
I don't want to think about anything.

306
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,460
I just want to do.

307
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,810
okay.

308
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,970
I need you to do exactly what I tell you.

309
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,120
 Yeah, yeah.

310
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,160
Porphyria?

311
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,820
I know the anesthesia makes it hard to focus,

312
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,530
but we need to start you on hemin right away.

313
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,580
House believes very strongly.

314
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,230
This is the right call.

315
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,250
Okay.

316
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,230
This thing is peeling.

317
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,300
Well, that is the cost of cowardice.

318
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,470
Should've gone for the real thing. I feel like I'm cheating.

319
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,210
A, it is only cheating if you don't have cancer,

320
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,320
and B, it's Wednesday afternoon.

321
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,220
Pickings are slim, and more importantly, sober.

322
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,820
The cancer cut is the surest way to the pity pooty party.

323
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,590
One down, one to go.

324
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,920
What? Wait, wait, wait.

325
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,410
She said yes? To a threesome?

326
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,430
She's empathetic.

327
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,420
She's a hooker.

328
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,160
- Gave me a cancer rate. - No.

329
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,730
I have never paid for sex in my life. You still haven't.

330
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,510
It's my treat.

331
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,920
It's either that, or you find two very open-minded women

332
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,230
to fall in love with you in the next hour.

333
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,970
Bartender seems nice.

334
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,440
Seems female.

335
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,980
Want something to eat?

336
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,660
My friend is dying of cancer.

337
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,570
Oh, you poor thing.

338
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,840
It took my mother two years ago.

339
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,190
But you can't give up hope.

340
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,590
He's pretty much resigned.

341
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,120
Just wants to go out with a bang.

342
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,830
And another pun, what time do you get off?

343
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,000
Pleural effusions. It's not porphyria.

344
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,610
We're gonna need to put in a chest tube. I wanna talk to House.

345
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,180
We'll tell him exactly what's happening. <i>I wanna talk to him!</i>

346
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,190
I want House.

347
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,830
Where is House?

348
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,080
<i>Where is he?</i>

349
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,510
<i>Where's House?</i>

350
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,980
We don't know.

351
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,840
You didn't have to sleep out here.

352
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,060
Four's a crowd. Apparently they left a long time ago.

353
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,080
So, how was it?

354
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,650
Was the amateur as good as the pro?

355
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,610
It was confusing. Perfunctory.

356
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,270
- A bit sad. - Never mind.

357
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,270
And exactly what I needed.

358
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,200
Thank you.

359
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,020
You feel like buying me breakfast?

360
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,110
One of them stole my wallet.

361
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,140
You're lucky he's not pressing charges. Porphyria was a legitimate call.

362
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,870
Until the pleural effusions. We've done everything House would've done if he'd been here.

363
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,550
You lied to a patient.

364
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,430
Treiber's condition is declining rapidly.

365
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,890
He's agreed to let me take over the case.

366
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,820
Dr. Chase will have no further contact with the patient. Fine.

367
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,140
<i>I didn't say you were off the case.</i>

368
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,430
Sit down.

369
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,320
Ordered a cardiac MRI.

370
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,030
Enlargement of the left ventricle suggests an infiltrative disease.

371
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,580
It's sarcoidosis.

372
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,510
We'll start him on corticosteroids <i>and do a cardiac biopsy to confirm.</i>

373
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,220
<i>I disagree. I was wrong about the porphyria,</i> but I wasn't wrong about the nervous system.

374
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,680
It's a Prion disease.

375
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,470
That's why his symptoms have progressed so rapidly.

376
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,510
It's possible he was exposed and didn't know it.

377
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,420
Brains are often stored
<i>and not tested until weeks after autopsy.</i>

378
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,470
Treiber's too good to not take the right precautions.

379
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,800
Maybe the problem is he thinks the same thing.

380
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,410
His job's built on the premise that doctors make mistakes; That includes him.

381
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,200
We should do a brain biopsy.
In his condition?

382
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,810
Then we biopsy the brains in the morgue. Find the one that exposed him.

383
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,280
It's a needle in a haystack.
There's four of us.

384
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,160
Come on, we can at least start him on amphotericin to halt the progress

385
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,410
while you do your heart biopsy.

386
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,820
No, we can't. Amphotericin plus the contrast dye <i>for the biopsy would overwhelm his kidneys.</i>

387
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,690
We have to choose one or the other.

388
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,250
Biopsy his heart.

389
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,900
Wallets go in the minibar freezer.

390
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,380
If there's no minibar, the toilet tank.

391
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,200
I've got exactly $20 left.

392
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,690
I'm sorry, I wasn't familiar with hooker protocol.

393
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,700
We can use your credit cards. No, we won't.

394
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm still on probation.

395
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,940
Leaving the state without permission <i>will really P.O. my P.O.</i>

396
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,240
Doesn't matter.

397
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,190
We can't even afford gas to get home.

398
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,420
We're three hours behind schedule.
We have enough gas to get to Julie.

399
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,980
I don't care about anything else.

400
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,970
What this time?

401
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,170
Just wondering how long this can last.

402
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,310
You're still hoping that I'm gonna wake up and admit that Kyle Calloway is just

403
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,410
some lame excuse to have some naughty thrills aren't you?

404
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,550
I'm actually hoping you won't.

405
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,840
I like Kyle.

406
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,080
Oh, come on.

407
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,630
 Move! Move!

408
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,380
 House.

409
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,090
You okay?
My leg still hurts.

410
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,950
Come on.

411
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,720
We got 20 bucks to go 11 miles.

412
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,750
Why aren't you answering your pages?

413
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,990
Busy.

414
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,090
The biopsy showed fibrosis in his cardiac muscle.

415
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,650
So it's not a Prion disease. <i>It means Foreman was wrong too.</i>

416
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,730
He wants everyone to meet in his office to DDX.

417
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,540
So he can tell us all it's an infection?

418
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,580
Interesting. Or maybe you should consider

419
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,400
<i>not being such a baby.</i> First instinct was an exposure from a corpse.

420
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,750
Treiber spends all his time here.

421
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,870
If it's not toxic gas, <i>not Prions...</i>

422
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,580
Then it has to be something else.
He's not perfect.

423
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,110
Are you trying to cure him or discredit him?

424
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,620
Treiber can only see me as not House.

425
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,310
Foreman too.

426
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,620
And they're not wrong.

427
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,760
So you're not coming upstairs.

428
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,830
No.

429
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,600
And when this case is over,

430
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,210
I'm quitting.

431
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,730
He's not quitting. He already called other hospitals.

432
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,500
Treiber did get under his skin. He'll get over it.

433
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,900
Fibrosis has to be a response to an infection.

434
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,430
Chase said you'd say that.

435
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,830
We'll test the biopsy samples for viruses and start him on antivirals.

436
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:20,010
You're not even gonna talk to Chase? He didn't leave after he got stabbed in the heart.

437
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,340
I think we're okay.

438
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,220
Either you're right, and your friend is just really upset,

439
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,630
or you're wrong, and he's come at this calmly and rationally,

440
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,600
and you're about to lose a good doctor.

441
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,060
Either way...

442
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,360
This is Oubliette, Ohio.

443
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,470
Buses don't run here after 1968.

444
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,790
Ina said there's a bus every 15 minutes.

445
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,820
Ina is living in Alzheimersville.

446
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,700
Been here at least half an hour.

447
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,990
Where are you going, Ina?
Naples, Florida.

448
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,950
Ben and I have a beautiful three-bedroom condo.

449
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,650
All on the one floor. You're waiting for a bus to Naples?

450
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,700
Comes every 15 minutes.

451
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,520
<i>Ben'll be wondering where his dinner is.</i>

452
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,470
Cab.

453
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,820
Whoa, cab!

454
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,510
20 bucks, 11 miles. Come on.

455
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,870
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

456
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,560
Julie's gonna be at the clinic

457
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,390
<i>for another 45 minutes; We can make this.</i>

458
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,210
She thinks she's in Florida.

459
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,540
Okay, bring her with.

460
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,480
I'm waiting for the bus.

461
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,310
Bus isn't coming, Ina. But this cab is going to Naples.

462
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,670
Ben'll be getting awfully hungry. House.

463
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,890
We'll tell the cabbie to call the cops.

464
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,450
<i>They'll come pick her up, take care of her.</i>

465
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,450
Then I'll stay with her until they do.

466
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,380
Good-bye, Kyle.

467
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,850
Bus comes every 15 minutes. Oh, shut up.

468
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,030
Find anything?

469
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,720
Not yet.

470
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,670
Running tests for MRSA.

471
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,720
You've got everybody worried about your quitting.

472
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,110
You here as my boss or my friend?

473
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,760
If I was here as your boss, you'd be suspended by now.

474
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,630
I've learned a lot here.

475
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,090
Enough to run my own team.

476
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,460
It's time I moved on.

477
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,650
Unfortunately, that's how I felt last year.

478
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,580
<i>And the year before that.</i>

479
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,730
Maybe there's a reason you haven't left.

480
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,950
<i>You need structure.</i> <i>And support.</i>

481
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,230
Somebody else calling the shots.

482
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,680
You didn't come down here as my boss or my friend.

483
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,080
You came down as House.

484
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,570
You're trying to insult me into making a decision.

485
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,570
We've both seen it work.

486
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,830
Either you rise to the challenge

487
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,210
and quit,

488
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,080
or you stay.

489
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:57,310
As a team member.

490
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,500
Dr. Treiber!
Dr. Treiber.

491
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,550
He stopped responding when I was changing his I.V. bag.

492
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,840
Peter, open your eyes.

493
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,610
Coma.

494
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,170
Treiber's comatose. <i>All brains on deck.</i>

495
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,420
Where should we start? We think you might be right.

496
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,020
I'm not.

497
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,520
You couldn't have gone through all of these.

498
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,960
Don't have to.

499
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,630
Treiber's reports are thorough to a fault.

500
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,620
His methods are fastidious. The answer isn't down here.

501
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,560
Treiber didn't miss anything. We did.

502
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,730
<i>So what?</i> <i>Psychosis, abdominal pain, pleural effusions,</i>

503
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,370
enlarged heart, coma. <i>Autoimmune, maybe Goodpasture's.</i>

504
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,110
Kidneys are fine. Vasculitis?

505
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,280
<i>- No fever. - Lymphoma?</i>

506
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,860
Would've seen it on the heart biopsy. <i>Soap.</i>

507
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,460
It's the soap.

508
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,680
I blew it.

509
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,890
Oh, God, here it comes.
As always.

510
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,620
All I wanted was some meaningless fun, and I couldn't even last three days.

511
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,310
Sound asleep.

512
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,170
I'm sleep talking.

513
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,460
I had the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream.

514
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,790
I swear, I will jump out of this moving bus if you don't shut up.

515
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,900
But instead, I sat with a sad, old woman for 11/2 hours

516
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,750
who forgot I existed three seconds after she left.

517
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,800
And the stupidest thing.

518
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,560
I never even had a crush on Julie Christie.

519
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,440
In 12th grade I was madly in love with Melanie Robbins,

520
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,840
who happened to look exactly like <i>Julie Christie in Dr. Zhivago.</i>

521
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,740
And she really liked me.

522
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,680
Played spades every lunch period in Mr. Charlton's classroom.

523
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,430
But of course, there was this other guy.

524
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:15,370
A great guy. Very popular. He had a car.

525
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,020
He had a band,

526
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,290
<i>a mustache...</i>

527
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,900
Kyle Calloway.

528
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,670
I assumed that-

529
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,470
I hoped that we would go to the senior prom together,

530
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,590
but she asked me for a favor. She asked...

531
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,800
If I minded if she went with him.

532
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,440
She asked me if I minded.

533
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,230
And I said I didn't.

534
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,480
<i>And that was it.</i>

535
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,000
<i>And I just did it again.</i>

536
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,090
<i>I let it go,</i> like I let everything go.

537
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,980
And here I am, sitting on this bus, with tickets I bought with my watch,

538
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,840
heading back home, so a...

539
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,540
a CT scan can decide my f-fate.

540
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,340
I don't wanna go back, House.

541
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,100
I just-

542
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,330
I just wanna keep being Kyle.

543
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:39,500
Kyle would've ditched that sad, old woman from the bus stop.

544
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,790
Probably would've ditched me too.

545
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,880
I can live without Kyle.

546
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,260
Snoball?

547
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,220
Guess this isn't heaven.

548
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,290
<i>We found out who screwed up.</i> You.

549
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,460
<i>It was your industrial-strength antibacterial soap.</i>

550
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,630
The additional triclosan does two things well:

551
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,130
Kills MRSA and makes your thyroid look stupid.

552
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,980
<i>It thinks the triclosan is a real hormone</i> <i>and closes up shop.</i>

553
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,220
Excessive use over time combined with excessive use of this

554
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,830
led to hypothyroidism.

555
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,620
Which went undiagnosed until it presented with psychosis.

556
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,780
When the ER put you on the sedatives,

557
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,810
it kicked you into myxedema crisis.

558
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,940
Don't know that I ever would've thought of that.

559
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,140
House told us to look for irony.

560
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,590
This wasn't House.

561
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,270
 My locker key.

562
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,510
I'll give you your own team.

563
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,560
Thanks.

564
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,710
But it's time to step out of the shadow.

565
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,040
It's about time.

566
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,880
Any news?

567
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,860
Not yet.

568
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,530
You come here so I could talk you out of it?

569
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,110
I came to say thank you.

570
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,100
It's been fun.

571
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,750
Fun?

572
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,130
Sounded pithier than...

573
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,570
"We've shared a variety of situations. "

574
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,200
Let me know about Wilson.

575
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,800
<i>Why did you let him go?</i>

576
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,560
Legal loophole. 13th Amendment.

577
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,610
Abraham Lincoln may have looked great in that hat,

578
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,990
but his labor policies...

579
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,550
House.

580
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,150
