1
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:04,139
Okay, boys and girls.

2
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:07,404
Guess what kind of animal Wacky Benny's making now?

3
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,386
<i>Give you a big hint.</i>

4
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,027
Is it a dead animal?

5
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:25,603
I say we put him out of his misery and bring out Emma's cake.

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,279
He's so new to this. <i>How's he gonna learn if we stop his act?</i>

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,114
You're a sucky clown.

8
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:34,306
And you're a super-duper audience.

9
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:41,665
Hey, that is not okay. Hey, keep your hands off my son.

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,515
Tell him to keep his hand off me.

11
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:55,375
I can't move my arm or leg.

12
00:00:56,426 --> 00:01:05,147

15
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:31,776
So how does a completely healthy teenager have a mini-stroke?

16
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:34,496
<i>Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal.</i>

17
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:36,456
Clotting parameters are normal.

18
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:40,007
You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt.

19
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:43,682
Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.

20
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:46,541
It's probably from my seat belt.
<i>Wrinkle pattern's too varied.</i>

21
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,655
It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.
Probably from the diaper bag.

22
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:53,214
If the patient's using drugs, cocaine could have caused an arterial spasm in his brain.

23
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:54,686
The tox screen was clean.

24
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:57,710
I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on,

25
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:01,079
not the ex-wife you cheated with.
If the latter was prone to violence,

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,219
you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.

27
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,108
Seriously?

28
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,752
No one else wants to talk about the patient?

29
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:13,305
New office furniture. Meaty topic.

30
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:15,934
What's the action on the ex-wife?

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,341
It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.

32
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:21,226
His company's moving him back to Portland.

33
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:22,811
He wants me to change my visitation order

34
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:26,734
so he can ask Rachel and my daughter to move out west with him.

35
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:28,538
<i>Things got a little heated.</i>

36
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:32,198
The patient was punched in the groin.

37
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,019
Could have triggered a massive sympathetic discharge.

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,921
Carotid duplex is normal.
Who's better qualified to be the daddy?

39
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:42,097
The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool

40
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:45,001
or the guy who's gonna be there day and night to pass on important values

41
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:48,446
like not shtupping mommy after the divorce?

42
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:53,125
I am her daddy. She's staying here. <i>House has a point.</i>

43
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:55,767
A couple nights a week with each kid may make you feel better.

44
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:57,941
Doesn't replace two 'round-the-clock parents.

45
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:00,087
'Round-the-clock or not, parenting's an impossible job.

46
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:04,639
No way not to mess it up. Why shouldn't Taub be the one to do it?

47
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,160
<i>- Thank you. - Makes sense.</i>

48
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,030
Park's tiger mom and dad were so insufferable,

49
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:11,115
<i>she has to measure their affection in hours.</i>

50
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:13,824
Chase's careerist dad and alcoholic mom

51
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:16,403
<i>were so indifferent, he has to believe it's a wash.</i>

52
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,379
<i>Your turn.</i>

53
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,924
What did your screwed-up parents do to screw up your view of parenting?

54
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,977
They were good parents. That's an oxymoron.

55
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:27,808
Chase is right. All parents screw up all children.

56
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:31,715
He's also dreamy, but it's not relevant now.
<i>So all parents screw up all children,</i>

57
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:35,650
but it makes some huge difference
if I keep my daughter here or let her move?

58
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:36,993
<i>Endocarditis.</i>

59
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:41,013
<i>Flipd a piece of vegetation into his brain,</i>
which could have broken up before the angiogram.

60
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:44,369
Transesophageal echo to confirm.

61
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:46,249
Screwed up is your best case.

62
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,706
Bouncing between a philandering workaholic dad

63
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:51,293
and an embittered, sexually betrayed mom,

64
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:53,779
it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared.

65
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:58,072
Is endocarditis treatable?

66
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:01,413
Very. The echo will show us any growths on his heart valve.

67
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:04,786
<i>Most likely meds will be enough.</i>
<i>He won't even need surgery.</i>

68
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:08,582
<i>He's just taken up performing</i> and it's very stressful for him.

69
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:12,090
Could that have caused this?
It's not stressful. I have fun.

70
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:14,998
Stress wouldn't be relevant, but anything that increases his adrenalin

71
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,682
could have made it worse.

72
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,983
Maybe we find you a new hobby, one you're a little better at.

73
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,981
I'm gonna get better at it, and it's not a hobby.

74
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:28,912
I- I think I want to get a job working as a circus clown,

75
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:30,548
<i>making people laugh.</i>

76
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:37,378
Ben, I-I don't think that's a good idea.
It was good enough for my dad.

77
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:42,107
You're a, uh... no, his biological father.

78
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:44,258
Could his dad's melanoma be a factor here?

79
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,421
That wouldn't be related. Ben, you barely knew him.

80
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,189
<i>You're such a smart kid.</i>

81
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,019
You could aim a lot higher than face paint and seltzer bottles.

82
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:00,456
I need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.

83
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:04,160
There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.

84
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:07,607
I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and sluggishness.

85
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,094
Weight loss is a symptom of diabetes.

86
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:13,350
<i>Fatigue is a symptom</i> of thinking you have disease you don't actually have,

87
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,963
and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue.

88
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:18,090
I need Insulin. I know it.

89
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:21,718
<i>Much as I'd like to kill you</i>
by dangerously lowering your blood sugar,

90
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:23,369
murder violates my parole.

91
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,336
That bloodwork is week's old. Test me again.

92
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:29,518
I am the test. The test is negative.

93
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,828
The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass.

94
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:37,589
That last insult was your cue to leave.

95
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:40,516
Test me.

96
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:44,744
Fine. Wait right here.

97
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,965
Thank you.

98
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,008
Sleep study.

99
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,027
Please make sure he's not disturbed for the next eight hours.

100
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,659
We need to talk about Saturday night.

101
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,614
No, no, no, no, no.

102
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:02,551
Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us.

103
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:06,590
The legendary night on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw

104
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,585
and you epically pay me $50.
I have a chance to really watch it.

105
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:13,274
A patient of mine has a pair of tickets he can't use,

106
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:17,958
and obviously you're under hoe and office arrest.

107
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,343
I just wanted to make sure you were cool

108
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:24,000
if I go to without you.
Uh, no, thanks.

109
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,848
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline your invitation

110
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,220
to not spend Saturday night with you.

111
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,697
These are ringside seats.

112
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:32,792
Cameras are ringside too.

113
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,955
If you want, I could sweat and spit and bleed on you from time to time.

114
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:41,078
I'd take you if I could.
Well, I'd take me if either of us could.

115
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,556
See what a tough spot I'm in? I'm going to that fight.

116
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,704
All right, I'll take the other ticket.

117
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,978
Let me worry about logistics.

118
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,157
Patient's heart valves are normal.
It's not endocarditis.

119
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,607
But he has a thickened pericardium, which makes no sense.

120
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:10,038
He has a heart problem
but not one that could have caused his T.I.A.

121
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,893
Syphilitic vasculitis would explain the T.I.A.
And the pericardial inflammation.

122
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:14,965
<i>Syph test was negative.</i>

123
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,119
Plus, the kid's never been sexually active.

124
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,504
Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart that says "birthday clown."

125
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:23,628
His late father was a circus clown. Histoplasmosis?

126
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,911
<i>He's not immuno-compromised.</i>
And I assume you added that irrelevant tidbit

127
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:29,204
<i>because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute</i>

128
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:31,698
and think it justifies keeping your daughter in New Jersey.

129
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,654
What if he has a heightened immune system?
I mentioned it because...

130
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,199
Take your time.
We'll continue with the medicine.

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,726
Sjogren's could have given him chronic pericarditis <i>and cerebral arteritis.</i>

132
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:48,109
Sjogren's it is.
IV immunosuppressant to treat.

133
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:50,985
Anything?

134
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:55,087
<i>This will calm your immune system.</i>

135
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:57,254
Should be out of here within the week.

136
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,624
My mom will be happy to hear that.

137
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:03,041
I've got an internship that starts in three weeks.

138
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:06,371
I take it it's not at a place with a big top.

139
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:09,066
It's at my stepdad's law office.

140
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:13,706
I know I'm not any good at being a clown yet,

141
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:16,095
but when I do get a laugh

142
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:19,403
and see those kids' eyes light up,

143
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:23,842
that's how my dad made me feel when I was a kid.

144
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,372
You need to hang on to that.

145
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:31,648
My mom says he was a loving father

146
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,109
but always broke and always on the road.

147
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,108
It's just a stupid way to make a living.

148
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,100
You're 16. Plenty of time to make money.

149
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:46,828
Wanting to build a connection with your dad

150
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,396
<i>and pass on some of the joy that he gave you,</i>

151
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,079
that's not stupid at all.

152
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,814
Ooh. I got it.

153
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:06,150
Is, uh, is this because of the medication?

154
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:07,813
Is it normal?

155
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:16,566
It's not normal, and it's not Sjogren's.

156
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:23,281
T.I.A., thickened pericardium,

157
00:09:23,282 --> 00:09:26,458
and now he's bleeding from his nose and mouth.

158
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,800
What are you doing with her?

159
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:32,105
"Her"?

160
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:37,184
Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name.

161
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,151
It's Sophie.

162
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:45,704
Both your kids are named... She's Sophie. The other one's Sophia.

163
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,962
It different enough. <i>they actually have</i>

164
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,487
two completely different derivations.

165
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,939
No, they don't.

166
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,962
I wasn't in a strong negotiating position.

167
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,556
Why is she here? Ruby dropped her off.

168
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:02,609
Seemed pretty upset.
Apparently someone forgot that it was daddy's night.

169
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,575
<i>She wasn't even gonna leave her</i>

170
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:05,549
until I said that I was letting you off early.

171
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,069
Damn it. I just started back on the team. My schedule's a mess.

172
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,290
If your own kids are a scheduling item, maybe you should let one of them move.

173
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,667
Patient has low platelets. Makes me think D.I.C.

174
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:19,812
<i>She doesn't seem to like that idea.</i> You're right.

175
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,661
He has no schistocytes in his smear.

176
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,865
He also has a low red count.

177
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:27,151
What if it's a retroperitoneal bleed?

178
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:31,047
No Grey-Turner's sign.
She wasn't fussing like that when I was holding her.

179
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,713
<i>Maybe she likes the sound of my voice,</i>

180
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:37,070
which is weird because I have no genetic connection to her.

181
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:41,218
Could it be she doesn't know the difference?

182
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:45,663
So many children of your own. No wonder you have such insight into my relationship with my babies.

183
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:46,475
<i>Good point.</i>

184
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:50,565
How could I comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name,

185
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:54,657
<i>too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar,</i>
<i>and too vain to admit that at this stage,</i>

186
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:56,951
you don't matter to either baby.

187
00:10:58,382 --> 00:11:00,543
Low white count suggests infection.

188
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:02,926
What if you're allright?

189
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,219
<i>Low platelets plus low red count</i>

190
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,332
<i>plus low white count equals...</i> Aplastic anemia.

191
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,759
Kid needs a bone marrow transplant.

192
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:15,083
Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match.

193
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,963
You started college a semester late

194
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,638
<i>because you left high school a semester late</i>

195
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,314
because you had five incompletes in your junior year.

196
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:35,957
And you're offering one bad semester as proof that my parents screwed me up?

197
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,377
Did okay before that. Straight as after that.

198
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:40,739
I went through a rebellious phase.
Don't tell me.

199
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,698
Mom and dad were at each other's throats

200
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:47,909
and the academic crisis was a cry for help.

201
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,808
Sorry to mess with your world view,

202
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:55,513
but I'm not messed up, so my parents couldn't have messed me up.

203
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:59,383
Mom's HLA is only a 3/6 match.

204
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:01,580
Maternal grandmother's worse than that.

205
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:03,003
Where did you unload the baby?

206
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:04,616
- Maternity ward. - Shut up.

207
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:07,778
You realize you're making House's argument for him.

208
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:11,779
The part where he said any parent who uses day care
should ship their child across the country?

209
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,192
No, the part where he said that baby doesn't need you.

210
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,809
<i>You've only got her a couple days a week</i>
and most of that's spent with a rotating cast of nurses.

211
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,764
That's how daddy likes to spend his time too.
Shut up.

212
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:24,430
First cousin's also a whiff.
So much for genetics mattering.

213
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:26,561
I'll try the marrow registry.

214
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,820
<i>- Dr. - Park is searching the registry.</i>

215
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,584
<i>Transfusing his platelets will keep him healthy while we wait.</i>

216
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,954
Are you sure there's no one on the father's side of the family?

217
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,208
If one of them's a match, that'd speed things up a lot.

218
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:41,954
His parents died young.
He was an only child.

219
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:45,468
There's no living relatives that I know of.
Something will turn up soon.

220
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:49,766
How soon is soon? Will he miss a lot of school? I'm actually thinking of just getting my ged.

221
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:53,380
How do you expect to get into a good college?

222
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:57,670
I'm gonna take classes on magic and juggling
and try to make a go of this.

223
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,644
Ben, you keep your grades up, you can do anything in the world.

224
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,742
Like what? Work in some boring office?

225
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,449
<i>I mean, do you think my father</i> would have done that for ten minutes?

226
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,900
You don't remember your father. You don't know...

227
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:11,334
I want to build a connection with him,

228
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:15,375
pass on some of the... The joy that he gave me.

229
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:21,586
My, uh, my back hurts. Uh...

230
00:13:23,682 --> 00:13:25,211
His BP is dropping.

231
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,685
<i>We think we've dealt wit all the liability issues.</i>

232
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:34,653
I'm in a meeting.
Sorry.

233
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:37,476
Since you paged me, I didn't want to keep you waiting.

234
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:39,853
Yeah, I paged you, which means you're next.

235
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:42,101
That's cool. I'll wait.

236
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:46,200
That's a good start. Let's go through it point by point.

237
00:13:46,898 --> 00:13:48,022
First up...

238
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:53,946
I'll call you back.

239
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,318
Just got this.

240
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:00,799
The American Associate of Rheumatology

241
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,844
wants you to speak, 9:00, Saturday, in Atlantic City.

242
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,569
Dr. Neusinger canceled on them at the last minute.

243
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,332
Hmm. I hate conferences.

244
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:15,621
This is a big one, and it's the premium slot.

245
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:17,119
I'd like you to do it.

246
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:19,237
I'll clear it with your parole officer.

247
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:21,930
What do I need to do for you?

248
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:28,079
Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled

249
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,486
and double the hooker budget that you recently halved.

250
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:35,835
I think you refer to it as petty cash.

251
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,716
Fine.

252
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,294
Just one thing.

253
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:44,131
I'm gonna ask them to put you on in the morning.

254
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:47,140
We're doing them a favor.
Why should you have to spend the night?

255
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,520
You said that 9:00 was the premium slot.

256
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,935
I mean, I want to feel like I've earned my hookers.

257
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:57,605
The place'll be a madhouse, especially since it's two miles from the Rubio fight

258
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,432
at the exact same time.

259
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,489
Nice try. You called up, pretended to be Neusinger,

260
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,472
cancelled, and suggested yourself as a replacement.

261
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:08,820
You go to that fight, you go to prison.

262
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:11,373
But that'd be redundant, when I have an angry black guy

263
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:13,690
waiting for me to drop the soap right here.

264
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:16,581
Better go do some of those clinic hours I recently doubled.

265
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,875
Test my urine.

266
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:28,790
Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.
Yeah. I have diabetes.

267
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,787
No, but you're not a hypochondriac

268
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:35,232
or you would have imagined some new disease after I shot down the first one.

269
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:38,576
So whose urine is that?
Diabetic girlfriend without health insurance?

270
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:41,229
It's not a scam. I'm sick.

271
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,842
Now I have swollen ankles.
The medical term is cankles.

272
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:47,467
Is there some black market in Insulin
that I don't know about?

273
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:50,702
It's in my genes.
My old man got diabetes at 50.

274
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:53,603
My older brother got it at 50. I just turned 50.

275
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:56,204
Well, it's a great argument if diabetes was a gold watch.

276
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,154
I got sciatica, like my dad.

277
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:03,201
Class-four hemorrhoids, like him. I need to get a jump on this thing.

278
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,203
We had to stop the transfusion.

279
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:10,666
Patient's having an allergic reaction to donor platelets. No one in mom's family's a match,

280
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,845
and as far as she knows, dad has no living relatives.

281
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,693
<i>It's been years since he died.</i>

282
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:26,348
If the kid's dad died young of melanoma,

283
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:30,148
<i>how come the overprotective mom</i> never took him to a dermatologist?

284
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,092
Are you gonna test my urine or what?

285
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:47,771
Not diabetes.

286
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,034
Use cross-matched platelets.

287
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:52,840
Try to find the patient some blood that's closer to his own.

288
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:55,433
<i>And get the real story on clown, senior's death.</i>

289
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,244
Mom's hiding something.

290
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,420
It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.

291
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,222
Apple juice.

292
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:06,106
Easiest way to fake a spike in blood sugar.

293
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:12,002
His family history of melanoma

294
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:15,463
may have affected his cellular outlook.

295
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:19,386
If we had more data on the exact type of melanoma his father had...

296
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:24,040
Otherwise, we might not be able to find a marrow match.

297
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,896
He never had melanoma. How did he die?

298
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:32,277
He didn't.

299
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:39,967
He lives in pennsauken under a different name,

300
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:41,171
Mitchell Gordon.

301
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:44,452
How could you keep this from me? From Ben?

302
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:50,811
He really needs to know his dad just breezed in and out of his life,

303
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,473
drunk and incoherent?

304
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:56,539
It's better to think the man's dead but decent.

305
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,774
<i>You realize I have to invite someone else to the Rubio fight?</i>

306
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,038
<i>- Nope. - No realization whatsoever.</i>

307
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:13,987
You have a LoJack on your leg. I was happy watching the fight on pay-per-view.

308
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:16,819
You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.

309
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:33,127
Your biological father was a decent, God-fearing minister.

310
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,883
The guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk.

311
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:37,873
I'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced

312
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:40,476
Adams has parentally inflicted damage.

313
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:43,515
You're trying to deflect. Now you are.

314
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:46,924
You have to believe that every parent screws up every child

315
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,092
or you were screwed out of a decent childhood.

316
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:51,198
My decent daddy of the cloth

317
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:54,506
was also being indecent with my married mom.

318
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:57,598
He probably would have taken other kids to the playground.

319
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:03,020
It's not my fault. Bad parenting.

320
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:17,596
Mitchell Gordon?
I've already got a religion. Go away.

321
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:19,195
We're doctors.

322
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:23,949
Your son Ben is in the hospital, at Princeton-Plainsboro.

323
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,372
Yeah, well, I don't have a son. Not anymore.

324
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:33,745
We know there are some issues there,
but your bone marrow could cure him.

325
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,801
There's a hospital two miles from here. It's a simple test.

326
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,393
You said he was at Princeton-Plainsboro?

327
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:44,004
His mother feels it's better to do the test
at a different hospital.

328
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,997
Well, I guess I don't have a son anymore.

329
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,282
House isn't gonna give up.

330
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:55,374
Just tell him about your parents or make up a lie.

331
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,308
I don't want to lie.

332
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,964
I don't want to validate his ridiculous theory.

333
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,461
It's not ridiculous.

334
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:04,403
En the best-intentioned parents
end up damaging their kids.

335
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,544
You're a smart, successful doctor.

336
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:09,614
How much damage could you have?

337
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:14,520
Know how I got interested in medicine?

338
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:17,746
When my mother drank, she couldn't handle me,

339
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:19,714
so she locked me in my father's study.

340
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:23,118
Only so many hours you can cry and bang on the door

341
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,624
before you give up, find something to read.

342
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:29,195
We all have family dysfunction.

343
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,934
That's why we're successful. To fill that hole.

344
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,180
My parents have a lot of money,

345
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:44,059
but they didn't make it legally.

346
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:48,085
White-collar crime?
It started with card games.

347
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:49,820
High-stakes poker.

348
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:53,150
Then my dad got into narcotics,

349
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,855
at first just selling but then using too,

350
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,867
or he never would have gotten into the slave trade.

351
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:05,206
Children mostly. Easier to pack in small crates.

352
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,236
Plus the shipping's a lot cheaper.

353
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,261
Won't even trust a co-worker.

354
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:15,724
What did your parents do to you?

355
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,211
You have to go see him yourself.

356
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:23,968
He wouldn't even ce to the door a second time.

357
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:27,507
Okay. I'll drive over there.

358
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,724
It's a pleural effusion. He had a bleeding problem earlier.

359
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:43,522
Must be bleeding into his lungs.

360
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:03,094
Except there's no blood.
What does it mean?

361
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:06,033
It means you don't have to make that drive.
The problem isn't his marrow.

362
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,619
It's his liver.

363
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:13,515
<i>- Liver failure. - Explains everything.</i>

364
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:16,896
The question is, what explains the liver failure? It's not an infection.

365
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:21,056
We tried antibiotics, but he's not responding. More curiously, what explains the mom

366
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:25,543
lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?

367
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,905
This is how you plan to get to the boxing game?

368
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:31,964
Why are you looking at her?

369
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:35,468
'Cause I'm stunned, and I have to look at something.

370
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:41,932
Match, bout, fight, contest, day, Helena.

371
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:46,144
Almost anything works after "boxing," except the word "game."

372
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:49,891
<i>Your bigger problem is,</i> the people who design those things aren't idiots.

373
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:53,496
Can you believe she used to work in the can?

374
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:56,264
Nothing is tamper-proof. <i>It's a synthetic problem.</i>

375
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:59,858
His liver's not synthesizing proteins, so fluid is leaking out of his blood vessels.

376
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:03,418
And mom's a selfish jerk.
<i>She traded up, married a lawyer,</i>

377
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,739
wants to forget the lowly circus clown.

378
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,491
You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens.

379
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:15,060
<i>You want to believe the mythical biological connection</i> excuses being a man slut.

380
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,639
I don't know why I'm starting to doubt your expertise.

381
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,075
You do have a classified ad and a piece of metal.
It's temperature that sets it off, not force.

382
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:25,070
The rivets go pop, I slide in the heating pad.
Easy peasy.

383
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,479
More likely the patient has a hyperammonemic problem.

384
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,657
<i>His liver's not cleaning out his blood.</i>
<i>The buildup of toxins is causing everything.</i>

385
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:34,393
I'm defending the dad because he got screwed.
After he lost his son, he lost his job.

386
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:36,658
<i>Been in and out of rehab, ve up clowning.</i>

387
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:40,092
Yes, as a parent, I empathize.
I say we tell the kid.

388
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:43,769
He's a minor, the mom's his guardian,
and it's not even medically relevant.

389
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:48,260
She robbed them of 12 years together.
Or she ripped off the band-aid too late.

390
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,165
<i>That memory that she let son of Bozo establish</i>

391
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,500
is making him chase his father's moronic profession

392
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:58,795
when he could be living the high life in Portland.

393
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:01,332
And I mean that metaphorically, of course.

394
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:06,892
This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.

395
00:24:14,674 --> 00:24:18,404
I see why employers are reluctant to hire ex-cons.

396
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,972
Well, what about the patient?

397
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:26,589
Is the problem hyperammonemic or synthetic?

398
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,025
<i>Can't treat for both.</i>
One requires hemodialysis, the other a liver transplant,

399
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:31,949
and we couldn't even get the kid a marrow match.

400
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,418
Get the mom's consent to pump him full of protein.

401
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:38,091
<i>If it's a synthetic problem,</i> more fluid will leak into h chest and his heart will fail.

402
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:41,700
<i>If it's hyperammonemic,</i> toxins will overwhelm his body and he'll go into a coma.

403
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:43,990
Do you only like tests that involve the risk of death?

404
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:48,382
There are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk?

405
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,048
In here.

406
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:07,393
Oh, my God. The water.

407
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:11,387
This is completely my fault.

408
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:17,286
<i>There are very serious risks,</i>
<i>but if we don't figure out what he has,</i>

409
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:19,239
we can't treat him at all.

410
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:31,031
I may be a little out of bounds here, but in case there are complications,

411
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:33,852
it might be a good time to come clean to your son,

412
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,384
let his father visit.
A little out of bounds?

413
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:42,324
I don't know the history, but everyone makes mistakes.

414
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,530
Your son worships him.
Doctor's right about that.

415
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:48,724
Oh, yeah? And when did he learn that?

416
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:51,266
When he encouraged Ben to drop out of school?

417
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:56,836
Mitchell is not Ben's father
any more than a sperm donor would have been.

418
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:04,269
Dr. House?

419
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:09,431
Unless you're a locksmith or an electrician
with political contacts, I'm busy.

420
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:11,149
<i>My husband saw you in the clinic.</i>

421
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,415
Wants treatment for diabetes.
My condolences on your forthcoming divorce.

422
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:17,259
<i>He keeps imagining symptoms,</i>

423
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,330
and now I have to make him these awful anti-diabetic meals.

424
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,114
Since I have no intention of testing him,

425
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,704
treating him, or cooking for him...

426
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,355
Could you write me a fake prescription for Insulin?

427
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:35,069
The advantage of fake prescriptions is,
you don't have to be a real doctor to write one.

428
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,298
Just tell me what's safe to inject in his thigh.

429
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:40,403
<i>His symptoms will go away</i>

430
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:42,772
and then I can show him he was never sick.

431
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:44,323
Water?

432
00:26:44,324 --> 00:26:47,274
Imaginary medicine is not my specialty.

433
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,262
I do have an imaginary colleague

434
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:53,669
who's just sent me an imaginary page. Imagine how sorry I am.

435
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,199
Still mad about what happened in the lab?

436
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,901
I'm not mad. I'm being professional.

437
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:10,853
You claim you're not screwed up.
You may even believe it.

438
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:14,768
But House doesn't and I don't,
so you can wait till he camps out on your parents' lawn

439
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:18,400
or you can admit you don't live on some higher plane and thank me later.

440
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:21,645
My, uh, my eye feels weird.

441
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:27,609
What's happening to me?

442
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:34,998
You look tired.
I hate it when people say that.

443
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:38,909
I know, I look bad.
I thought you were gonna go to bed early last night.

444
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:42,556
Like an idiot, I went out with my girlfriends to pretend I have a life, 

445
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:46,803
when all I did was flirt with guys who'd have no interest in a mom,

446
00:27:46,804 --> 00:27:50,938
miss the baby I couldn't wait to get rid of, and then get yelled at by my mom for staying out too late.

447
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,585
- You need your own place. - Yes.

448
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:56,585
I moved back home because it was too drafty at the four seasons.
So go back to work at the hospital.

449
00:27:56,586 --> 00:27:59,546
Day care costs more than what I earned as a nurse.

450
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,930
Have you considered sub-standard day care?

451
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,718
Why don't you stay here toght?

452
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:09,709
No. I mean, in the guest room.

453
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,368
I'll watch the baby again, and you can get a real night's sleep.

454
00:28:14,408 --> 00:28:15,758
You'd do that?

455
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:25,230
Win-win.

456
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,656
Mommy gets a rest, daddy gets more time with his little angel.

457
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,536
There's some sweats in the closet in the back.

458
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,217
Lucky girl.

459
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:43,237
Gets another sleepover with da-da.

460
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:46,743
It makes a difference.

461
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:50,106
Doesn't it?

462
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:04,286
Didn't answer your page last night.
Sorry. Battery died.

463
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:07,456
We got the patient's eye back in place with steroid injections,

464
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:10,688
but a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver problem.

465
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:13,358
And mom's determination to keep dad away,

466
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,632
even as her kid gets sicker and sicker, means she's got more to hide.

467
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:19,089
It's not diagnostically relevant.
<i>Let's let it drop.</i>

468
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,336
You just lost my vote.
You flip-flopped on parental rights.

469
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:25,843
I've been trying to persuade the mother,
but it's her son, so it's her call.

470
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:27,380
Well, that very evolved of you.

471
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:31,233
Don't usually see Darwinian changes over breakfast.

472
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:34,686
You made nice-nice with Phil, you decided that

473
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:38,830
he'd make a decent father for thing 2 after all.

474
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:41,955
I had Sophie again last night and Ruby slept in my guest room,

475
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,853
<i>which has nothing to do with Phil,</i>

476
00:29:43,854 --> 00:29:46,061
who will never be a father to my children.

477
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:48,427
Angioneurotic edema can cause rapid swelling.

478
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:52,853
Hey, we're having a conversation here.
No abdominal pain.

479
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:55,588
So that must have been nice, having Ruby
and the baby under one roof.

480
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:58,038
Yes, it was nice having my daughter in my home.

481
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,762
That's why I would like her sister to live near my home.

482
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:03,305
Anasarca?
Swelling would have followed gravity.

483
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:06,883
Isn't that getting this whole parenting thing ass backwards?

484
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:10,738
<i>Aren't you supposed to figure out what you can sacrifice</i>
to maximize their niceness?

485
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:13,791
And do you think I should sacrifice myself from their lives?

486
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,053
Just one life,

487
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:18,876
until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you.

488
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:22,271
Swelling that fast and localized
has to come from the lymph nodes.

489
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:24,147
<i>Burkitt's lymphoma.</i>

490
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:30,780
Swelling. Cankles.

491
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:32,090
<i>That's not a symptom of Burkitt's.</i>

492
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:34,171
- Are you saying it's... - It's Burkitt's.

493
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,241
Prep him for chemo.

494
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,654
I think you should give House permission to go to Atlantic City.

495
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:53,872
We'll stop by the rheumatology conference.

496
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:56,367
Everyone's covered. No.

497
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:00,148
The guy has earned the right to go to one boxing match.

498
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,576
He's done everything you've asked... Funded and staffed his own department.

499
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:06,827
Hasn't even broken as much as a traffic law.

500
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:08,386
You're right.

501
00:31:08,872 --> 00:31:12,768
So you'll let him go? No.

502
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:15,772
<i>I get why he wants to go to that fight.</i>
I'd love to go myself,

503
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:20,220
which is kind of why I have to stop him.
My job is to be the jerk.

504
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:22,659
House has to believe that I have authority over him.

505
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,935
He can't function under someone's thumb.

506
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:27,743
I know, which means you can't go either.

507
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:35,348
Your job is to be his friend, to stay here and sit with him

508
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:37,734
and watch the fight on pay-per-view while bitching about me.

509
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:41,304
If we both do our jobs, we might actually get him through his parole.

510
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:47,134
You're right.

511
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:52,964
<i>Sorry to show up like this.</i>

512
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:55,903
I was expecting a battery of lawyers.
No lawyers.

513
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,492
Phil had something that he would like to say,

514
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:01,263
so I thought that he should say it in person.

515
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:07,104
It was wrong of me to confront you about taking Rachel to Portland.

516
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:09,714
You don't want to move to Portland?

517
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:12,550
Of course I do, but this is about your daughter too

518
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:16,234
and I'm not gonna do something like this without your support.

519
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,151
So you guys are trying to manipulate me

520
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:21,911
by playing good cop/good cop?

521
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:23,782
Is that how little you think of me?

522
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:27,497
It's clear you're back working for House.

523
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,204
I will see you this weekend when you pick up Sophie.

524
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:34,406
Sophia. We actually started calling her Sophie.

525
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:35,731
Yeah.

526
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:40,047
Great.
It's cute.

527
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,723
Cankles.

528
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:51,633
Is there some problem with the prescription you gave me?

529
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:54,434
I'm faint. I've been gaining more weight.

530
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:59,093
I think I need a bigger dose.
If you double his placebo, he might drown.

531
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:03,515
Also, you forgot to mention that your heart rate is slow.

532
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,662
My... my heart rate is not...

533
00:33:06,878 --> 00:33:10,064
52. The technical term is slow.

534
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:15,563
Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat, do they contain bok choy?

535
00:33:15,564 --> 00:33:17,258
A pound of it. Every day.

536
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:22,663
Bok choy has glucosinolates which inhibit thyroid function

537
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:24,854
and account for all your symptoms.

538
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:27,263
So this isn't diabetes?

539
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:30,119
You have a bad case of irony.

540
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,378
The food that you're eating to stop making you sick
is making you sick.

541
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,733
Hey, maybe I don't have my father's crummy genes after all.

542
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:41,130
On the other hand, maybe you're fat enough
to get diabetes even without him.

543
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,640
I can't believe I have cancer.

544
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:51,356
We caught it early. You should be okay.

545
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:56,312
I could die. I never went anywhere, did anything.

546
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:58,098
If my father had lived,

547
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:00,460
everything would have been different.

548
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:03,293
Your mom and stepdad love you.

549
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:05,566
They've given you a great home.

550
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,586
That counts for a lot.

551
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:13,130
He's crashing. Everything's shutting down.

552
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:24,542
<i>Renal failure, lung failure, heart failure,</i>
<i>all before we started chemo.</i>

553
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:28,408
<i>Burkitt's lymphoma is fast-moving, but not this fast.</i>

554
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:36,377
No rush. ICU stands for take your time in Latin.

555
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:38,045
Multiple aneurysms.

556
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:39,917
That would mean that every symptom after his T.I.A.

557
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,869
was a coincidence.
Cholesterol emboli?

558
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,098
Bingo. Fits perfectly. Check the file.

559
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:47,450
Confirm that we did major abdominal surgery on him

560
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,983
<i>and then completely forgot about it.</i>

561
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:52,699
<i>House.</i>

562
00:34:56,998 --> 00:34:58,453
Hello?

563
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:04,567
What the hell are you doing here?
I was told that this might be my last chance to see my son.

564
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,102
You had no right! This is none of your business!

565
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:09,216
- I didn't. - I called him.

566
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:10,626
This man's Ben's hero.

567
00:35:10,627 --> 00:35:12,786
Let them spend five minutes together.

568
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:17,046
No! Get out of here!

569
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:24,995
Wait.

570
00:35:30,654 --> 00:35:34,723
You sexually molested your son.
Your walk.

571
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:36,563
<i>Tabes dorsalis.</i>

572
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:39,051
<i>You have late-stage syphilis,</i>

573
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:42,731
which you gave to our patient presumably 12 years ago,

574
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:46,611
<i>which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions.</i>

575
00:35:48,518 --> 00:35:49,872
I shouldn't be here.

576
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:01,667
We tested him for syphilis. He was negative.

577
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:06,252
<i>After 12 years, the active infection would have died down</i>

578
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:10,235
everywhere except the arteries in his brain, where it could hide out from our tests.

579
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:14,246
<i>But when that six-year-old heckler</i> <i>punched him in his juggling pins,</i>

580
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,136
<i>it kicked up the dormant bacteria in his pelvis.</i>

581
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:19,990
<i>The immunosuppressants we gave him</i> <i>sent it into overdrive.</i>

582
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:23,917
<i>The antibiotics we gave him</i> <i>actually started destroying the syphilis.</i>

583
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:26,054
<i>But like pouring water on a fire,</i>

584
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:28,586
<i>that led to a trail of toxic smoke and ash</i>

585
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,662
<i>which made his immune system overcompensate.</i>

586
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:33,546
<i>Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.</i>

587
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:37,206
Is this true? Yes, Jarisch-herxheimer is real.

588
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:38,996
It sounds silly, but...

589
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:41,994
Oh, you mean the... the... right.

590
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:49,326
I found stains on his clothes.

591
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:57,275
He didn't understand and he didn't seem traumatized.

592
00:36:57,852 --> 00:37:02,444
I kept trying to talk to him, but before long, he'd forgotten,

593
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:04,478
and he seemed...

594
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:07,679
And he seemed happy and he seemed normal.

595
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,732
So you made daddy go away
and you made sure junior had no reason to go looking.

596
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:15,310
I was just trying to protect him,

597
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,492
<i>like I should have done from the start.</i>

598
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:22,922
Sorry.

599
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,851
<i>IV penicillin and anti-TNF antibodies,</i>

600
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:30,392
<i>he'll be fine.</i>

601
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:33,478
Apart from the whole daddy-rape thing.

602
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:42,622
We're not done.

603
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:46,608
No, we are not.
Notify the dad's sexual partners.

604
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:48,839
Notify his employer, his landlord.

605
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,662
Notify the police.
I meant the kid.

606
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:53,730
We're not gonna tell him he was molested?

607
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:58,411
To make him miserable or to forfeit your license?
To tell him the truth.

608
00:37:58,412 --> 00:38:01,218
He's a virgin. How do we explain the STD?

609
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:03,932
It's a medical diagnosis. Screw the parents.
The kid's our patient.

610
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:07,723
I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make when the kid wakes up.

611
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,795
Why is it my choice?
'Cause you're a dad.

612
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:13,549
How could the rest of us possibly understand?

613
00:38:23,298 --> 00:38:25,489
What was... What was wrong with me?

614
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:29,947
It's called syphilis.

615
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:35,866
Uh, you... you can get that without having sex?

616
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:50,429
I didn't tell him.

617
00:38:53,483 --> 00:38:55,065
Your heart said he needed to know.

618
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,556
Your brain knew he's better off without it.

619
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:03,649
Following your heart is easy.
Following your brain is tough.

620
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:07,537
<i>Especially after years of following</i>
<i>that much smaller third organ.</i>

621
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:13,514
That's why all parents screw up all children.

622
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:22,683
Evening.

623
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:32,080
Clever tactic, pretending you're not interested anymore.

624
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:36,131
How could that possibly work as a tactic?

625
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:40,838
The fact is, once I saw those incompletes,
I knew your parents screwed you up.

626
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,794
The details are just gravy.

627
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:46,021
You're wrong.

628
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,344
The only evidence you have is proof of something else.

629
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:54,433
I ran away from home.

630
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,462
Because you had lousy parents.

631
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:02,416
Because I didn't.

632
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,234
All my friends' parents were divorced

633
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:08,957
or having affairs

634
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,820
or barely knew their kids' birthdays.

635
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,141
You envied their dysfunction?

636
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:22,532
I- I thought it made them deeper somehow.

637
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:27,902
It was stupid.

638
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:32,278
I hitchhiked to Manhattan, moved in with an older guy.

639
00:40:32,426 --> 00:40:34,859
In two months, I came running home.

640
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,562
It took my parents years to get over it.

641
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:41,955
That's when you started to excel.

642
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:44,734
You were making it up to them.

643
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:49,958
Your parents screwed you up by not screwing you up.

644
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:53,906
How does briefly wishing I was screwed up make me screwed up?

645
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:56,733
It's normal to be screwed up.

646
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:59,523
It's really screwed up to romanticize it.

647
00:41:00,604 --> 00:41:03,142
I guess that's why you wanted to work with prisoners.

648
00:41:04,737 --> 00:41:07,633
It's why I wanted to work with you.

649
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:13,916
It was a tactic.

650
00:41:32,553 --> 00:41:33,420
Chris.

651
00:41:33,421 --> 00:41:37,873
<i>Yeah.</i> I need to talk to you and Phil.

652
00:41:39,368 --> 00:41:40,926
Is everything okay?

653
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,155
Yeah.

654
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:56,420
I can't let you move.

655
00:41:57,495 --> 00:42:01,726
You drove all the way out here just to tell us what you already told us.

656
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:03,310
I'm sorry.

657
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:17,043
<i>House, open up.</i> <i>I don't want to miss the opening bell.</i>

658
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,747
House?

659
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:36,184
<i>Telecast, we expect an electric atmosphere</i>

660
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:38,987
<i>in the arena and a sellout crowd of about 10,000</i>

661
00:42:38,988 --> 00:42:41,106
<i>for Rubio versus Santos, two great fighters</i>

662
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:45,236
<i>with illustrious careers</i>
<i>who might have been expected to meet a long time ago.</i>

663
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:49,002
<i>As for Santos, his handlers tell us</i> <i>that he's done more roadwork</i>

664
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:50,241
<i>than at any time in his career,</i>

665
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:53,838
<i>hoping to prove tonight that he can box for 12 full rounds.</i>

666
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,388
<i>Significant because Santos hasn't heard the final bell</i>

667
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:59,060
<i>in more than six years.</i>

668
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:04,318
<i>He comes in with 11 straight knockout wins</i>
<i>and we saw how a power puncher with a left hook</i>

669
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,605
<i>was able to cut Rubio over the right eye</i>
<i>in the tenth round of that last fight.</i>

670
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:19,503
