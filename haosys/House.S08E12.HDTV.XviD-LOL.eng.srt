1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,770
You're bleeding through your bandage.

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,010
Good morning.

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,360
Don't we need to get you to a doctor?

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,310
I am a doctor.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,540
That didn't come up last night?

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,860
We didn't do a lot of talking.

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,010
I'm good.

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,990
You never told me what caused your accident.

9
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,400
I was stabbed by a patient.

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,880
That'll teach me to overbill.

11
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,660
YOU HAVE A NEW TEXT MESSAGE

12
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,070
FROM HOUSE
DING DONG

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,910
If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes.

14
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,090
What do you want?

15
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,860
45-year-old truck driver, recurrent seizures.

16
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,200
No metabolic or structural... does this look like a good time?

17
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,840
Sort of.

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,550
At least as good as the other 12 times

19
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,400
that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.

20
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,720
Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you.

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,680
Kinda like now.

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,110
I'd apologize again,

23
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,670
but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one.

24
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,210
You do work for me.

25
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,200
I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,860
I don't know when I'm coming back. I don't know if I'm coming back.

27
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,410
Got a problem with that,

28
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,080
fire me.

29

豪斯医生  第八季第12集</font>

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:40,520
<font color=#4096d1>-=破烂熊字幕组=-

32
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,930
Nice.

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,820
It's good to see you in the hospital, as a patient if not as a doctor.

34
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,930
Believe me,

35
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,350
I'd rather be the guy with the clipboard.

36
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,840
How you doing?

37
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,020
Arrhythmias are gone.

38
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,160
Fine motor control is improving.

39
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,450
Not what I meant.

40
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,200
If you need to talk to someone,

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,600
a professional...

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,010
I'm fine.

43
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,740
Fine enough to get back to work?

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,050
You don't have to work for House, but you do owe me 20 clinic hours.

45
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,720
What, getting knifed doesn't buy me an extension?

46
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,450
Buys you whatever you need. But I know you.

47
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,730
If all you do is physical therapy and your nighttime version of it,

48
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,580
you'll lose your mind faster than you regain those fine motor skills.

49
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,610
EXAM ROOM TWO

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,620
I, uh, have this terrible pain

51
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,130
in my left shoulder.

52
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,200
It came out of nowhere.

53
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,260
And nothing seems to help.

54
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,720
Any other symptoms?

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,970
Chest pain? Lightheadedness?

56
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,920
No. None at all.

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,460
What were you doing when the pain came on? Just sitting and praying.

58
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,700
She'd been helping to make the altar breads that morning,

59
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,730
but no hard physical work or repetitive motion.

60
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,630
A couple of possibilities.

61
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,360
You have enlarged lymph nodes, so I'd like to start by ruling out breast cancer.

62
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,530
And I do mean "rule out."

63
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,580
It's probably nothing.
I'm gonna do a quick breast exam.

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,450
Do you mind stepping out for a moment?

65
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,640
Not at all.

66
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,050
That was so I could ask about the second possibility.

67
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,650
Left-sided pain means it could be angina,

68
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,540
which is made worse by stress.

69
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,620
Might not be a coincidence that the pain started

70
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,260
on the verge of a major life change.

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,920
How did you know?

72
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,610
Blue Veil means you're a postulant, haven't taken your vows yet.

73
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,940
Brown Vestments means you're Carmelites,

74
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,060
cloistered nuns, which explains the chaperone.

75
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,040
You're about to withdraw from the world for good.

76
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,310
I was a seminarian.

77
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,270
Who obviously didn't take his vows.

78
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,480
Cassock made my ass look fat.

79
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,790
Do you mind unbuttoning your shirt and lying down for me?

80
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,940
Okay.

81
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,510
I have had second thoughts.

82
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,230
I'm kind of a wreck.

83
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,210
A life of perpetual enclosure and almost complete silence?

84
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,590
If you weren't wrestling with this, I'd say there's something really wrong with you.

85
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,830
I'm going to admit you.

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,850
There's a little mass here, and I'd like to get it checked out.

87
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,090
It's just a benign fat deposit. Her imaging's clean.

88
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,780
Stress test too. It's not angina.

89
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,360
So why the shoulder pain?

90
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,590
Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?

91
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,450
- Thanks a lot. - I didn't tell him.

92
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,500
You were cagey about where you were going. And Chase being cagey in general.

93
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,920
Good chance I'd find the two of you in the same cage.

94
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,660
So I had Park follow you.

95
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,870
How you feeling?

96
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,140
Better.

97
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,410
Heard your arm's healing nicely.

98
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,020
Good to see you on your feet. Patient's a nun?

99
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,330
You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?

100
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,840
She was next up in the clinic. And I don't want your help.

101
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,660
You got stabbed.

102
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,610
You blame me.

103
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,550
But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?

104
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,890
Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.

105
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,710
Or maybe the reverse is true.

106
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,000
Thanks for all your help.

107
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,350
Your soul sister is having a fungal infection

108
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,540
from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.

109
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,430
Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.

110
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,140
Thanks for all my help.

111
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,170
I'm... I'm sorry I led House to you.

112
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,360
It's part of the job.

113
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,760
Maybe we could get a meal after work tonight,

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,520
if you want some companionship.

115
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,750
You asking me out on a date?

116
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,830
No.

117
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,410
I just... I guess that sounded...

118
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,570
must be scary to be back.

119
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,150
All those knives and needles.

120
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,740
Infected blood and tissue everywhere you look.

121
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,310
Just thought you might need someone to talk to about it.

122
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,920
Just knowing you're there for me is enough.

123
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,410
Thanks.

124
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,030
Ever surf Kirra point?

125
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,150
Obviously you're Australian.

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,450
I've surfed all over the gold coast.

127
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,120
Don't tell me you have. The closest I got was Waimea Bay.

128
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,870
I grew up on Maui.

129
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,170
If you don't mind me asking, why are you becoming a nun?

130
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,030
You asking 'cause I surf?

131
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,360
Well, I know that Jesus walked on water but...

132
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,230
Plus the average postulant is a lot younger than you.

133
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,300
What were you doing before this? Not much of anything.

134
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,520
Worked as a nanny. Moved around a lot.

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,170
Bunch of failed relationships. And then what?

136
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,740
God spoke to you? You heard the calling?

137
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,240
Something like that.

138
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,780
Does there have to be some dramatic moment where the skies part?

139
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,140
Usually, yeah.

140
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Is that what happened to you when you entered the seminary?

141
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,850
Mom drank, dad worked. They stuck me in catholic school.

142
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,750
Priests and nuns were the closest I had to family.

143
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,070
Turned out that wasn't much of a reason to join the priesthood.

144
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,090
Is that why you left?

145
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,360
Something like that.

146
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,170
I think I may throw up.

147
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,880
What's wrong with me?

148
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,530
Not a fungal infection.

149
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,750
You're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?

150
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,760
I'm not. Well, I'll tell you.

151
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,640
You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control

152
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,370
when you got knifed in the ventricle. Taub has decided...

153
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,140
I need help with my patient. She's vomiting.

154
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,850
That's not from a fungal infection.

155
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,200
What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?

156
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,690
I have no idea.

157
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,290
Almost dying's been clarifying. I can do anything.

158
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,430
You can do anything.

159
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,010
So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years.

160
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,380
Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.

161
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,260
Can we get to my patient sometime soon?

162
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,600
As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.

163
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,320
You'll help me.

164
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,090
'Cause even though you don't find my case interesting,

165
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,500
you find my interest in it interesting.

166
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,230
Well, when you put it that way...

167
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,470
Ascending colangitis.

168
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,210
Missed me. Can't be, bilirubin's normal.

169
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,290
Clinical signs can show up days

170
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,950
before lab signs.

171
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,700
This is great. We should make this a regular thing.

172
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,430
She can't feel her foot at all.

173
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,180
What does this mean?

174
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,140
It means I've got to spend more time consulting with a colleague.

175
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,200
17-ketosteroid levels are low.

176
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,210
How can he be hyper-sexual?

177
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,210
He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer.

178
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,130
You think his sexuality is normal?

179
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,610
I need more help. My patient has a new symptom.

180
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,840
Ischemic foot.

181
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,640
Get the lecture out of your system so we can talk about my case.

182
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,200
Let me start with an allegory.

183
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,170
Okay, I'm curious.

184
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,370
Your overreaction to your stabbing

185
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,990
is to blame me even as you are drawn to me.

186
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,800
Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes

187
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,980
that won't defend him against anything.

188
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,070
Krav Maga.

189
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,320
Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me

190
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,170
defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.

191
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,390
Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics

192
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,300
he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.

193
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,310
I've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.

194
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,390
And the seventh? And the eighth?

195
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,390
And the Nth?

196
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,540
If you get him, what's that gonna prove? That unexpected things happen.

197
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,720
By definition, no class can teach you to expect them.

198
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,980
Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them,

199
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,780
and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.

200
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,370
Blood clot.

201
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,280
Her D-dimer's normal.

202
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,090
On the other hand...

203
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,200
What if he's right about the blockage but wrong about the cause?

204
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,980
Vasospasm.

205
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,380
That explains everything but the lymph nodes.

206
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,150
And any minor infection could have caused those. Calcium channel blocker to treat.

207
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,880
Are you okay? I almost got you killed by bringing a scalpel into that room.

208
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,040
I could feel better about that. You saved my life too.

209
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,780
I think the ledger's clear.

210
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,050
But how can you not be traumatized?

211
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,470
Can't change what happened.

212
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,170
Can only make better choices from here.

213
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,860
So you're zen about it but won't let go of your anger toward House?

214
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm seeing a trauma counselor. I think you should too.

215
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,230
I'm okay.

216
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,120
Just knowing you're there for me is enough.

217
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,730
Convent lets you have this?

218
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,190
I borrowed it from one of the nurses.

219
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,970
I'm still on temporary vows.

220
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,210
It may be the last time I hear Eminem for a while.

221
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,800
You're using an iPod.

222
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,460
But I've never seen you use rosary beads.

223
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,980
What day did Jesus die?

224
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,900
I know, one gospel says passover,

225
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,670
another says the day before.

226
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,100
How many times did the cock crow before Peter's third denial?

227
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,030
Once or twice?

228
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,260
You can't argue away my faith.

229
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,310
Why?

230
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,020
Because it's so strong

231
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,150
even plain contradictions...

232
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,150
because it's not that strong.

233
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,430
I'm not saying I don't have faith.

234
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,210
I just haven't felt the calling yet.

235
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,820
No one joins the clergy without having that epiphany.

236
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,640
That God's love is speaking to you directly.

237
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,750
It's the silence, the contemplation,

238
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,460
the order. I need them.

239
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,620
Hoping everything else will come later.

240
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,690
That's not an answer.

241
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,760
If you want silence, you can get ear plugs.

242
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,020
I tried the outside world.

243
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,240
It wasn't enough. Have you been married?

244
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,220
No.

245
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,200
No kids. You never found a career.

246
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,450
Doesn't sound like the outside world got much of a try.

247
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,530
What you're headed towards now,

248
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,210
14 hours a day in silent prayer,

249
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,050
never having a family,

250
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,150
never touching another human being.

251
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,060
Just because that's what you'd miss the most.

252
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,320
The nurses talk.

253
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,490
Nothing's wrong with having fun.

254
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,290
They said you were almost killed three weeks ago.

255
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,740
You go right back to fun?

256
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,590
Is that why you wanna be a nun?

257
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,730
Someone broke your heart.

258
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,630
No.

259
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,610
I'm just looking for something more.

260
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,440
So am I.

261
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,840
I'm late for work in the clinic.

262
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,200
Really? George Washinbaum?

263
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,650
He was a character in the Flintsteins.

264
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,580
Just hiding out till House leaves the cafeteria.

265
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,630
The self-defense classes, you think they're making any kind of difference?

266
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,020
Not as much as House's surprise attacks.

267
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,150
He thinks three steps ahead, so I do too.

268
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,560
Which is why you should accept his apology and come back on the team.

269
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,820
He's annoying, he's maddening.

270
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,730
But he makes us all better.

271
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,780
Note to self.

272
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,700
Foot color's good.

273
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,220
Arterial pulse is good.

274
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,420
Capillary refill's good.

275
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,200
And her shoulder pain is all gone.

276
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,910
Looks like you're ready to go home.

277
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,810
I'll get the car and meet you out front.

278
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,020
I'd say I'm in the book,

279
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,860
but not the one you'll be reading from now on.

280
00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:00,580
Six years ago, I was a nanny in Honolulu for this beautiful two-year-old boy.

281
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,300
I loved him.

282
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,400
Probably spent more time with him than his own parents.

283
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,430
One day I was in the park talking with another nanny.

284
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,850
He wandered out of the sandbox into the street,

285
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,730
into the path of a moving car.

286
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,850
That could have happened to anyone.

287
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,340
I don't think so.

288
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,180
And even if it did, they'd blame themselves for the rest of their lives too.

289
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,720
You shouldn't.

290
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,170
You shouldn't run from what can still be a good life.

291
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,820
I'm running to God.

292
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,180
After what happened to you, don't you wanna remake your life?

293
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,400
Not by hiding myself away.

294
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,930
I hope it works out for you.

295
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,590
It is gonna be hard.

296
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,210
Not touching anyone.

297
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,150
Who knew mother inferior was a smoking hottie.

298
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,000
No wonder you're playing handsies with her.

299
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
You think I'm hitting on a nun?

300
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,050
Angry at God or I just need a challenge?

301
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,450
Or you're terrified of intimacy,

302
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,210
which is why you're a serial slut.

303
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,000
But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft.

304
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,110
Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option.

305
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,740
That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing.

306
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,800
I'm not emotionally involved with her.

307
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,200
And much as I'd love to hear you contradict me,

308
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,970
I have a 7:30 appointment to explore my intimacy issues

309
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,280
at La Scala.

310
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,760
I'm talking to this agent. He's a bit of a sleaze.

311
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,190
But he's really excited about representing me.

312
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,380
Although he can't take on any new clients right now, he's trying to get mean audition

313
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,020
for one of those online soaps. Have you ever watched one of those?

314
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,170
Am I boring you?

315
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,390
Unfortunately, yeah.

316
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,950
Sorry.

317
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,120
You're not supposed to be here.

318
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,720
Or anywhere. Yeah.

319
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,160
You were right.

320
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,560
I was running away.

321
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,460
Oh, now you're shy.

322
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,640
It's brighter in the morning.

323
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,480
So are we gonna spend the rest of eternity

324
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,510
in a lake of fire while pointy-tailed demons

325
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,710
poke at us with sticks?

326
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,980
This is a little scary for me.

327
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,170
I had a whole life planned.

328
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,580
Not that I wasn't struggling with it.

329
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,860
And then I met you.

330
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,160
Don't worry, I know you're not the relationship type.

331
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,040
I'm not not the relationship type.

332
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,460
I was married once. Relax.

333
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,900
You're fine.

334
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,900
So what's next for you?

335
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,610
I have to find a place to live.

336
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,550
Get my old job back.

337
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,630
Sure, I'll feel guilty, start doubting.

338
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,620
As long as you keep dealing with your doubts

339
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,720
in the same way then...

340
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,830
Moira?

341
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,220
I'm sorry, did you say something?

342
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,340
Your neck. What?

343
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,990
Are your ears ringing?

344
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,330
Yeah. What does that mean?

345
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,030
We've got to get you back to the hospital right away.

346
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,200
The artery that's bringing blood to your brain,

347
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,030
it's coming apart. Means you could stroke.

348
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,130
I've paged a team of our best doctors. I don't have to cough as much.

349
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,230
It's clotted up.

350
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,390
Is that bad?

351
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,720
We're almost there.

352
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,030
Get me her O-two level.

353
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,030
What are you doing? I want to make sure I can position her wrist properly.

354
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,560
- For what? - A.B.G.

355
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,180
I don't need an A.B.G. Just get a pulse OX.

356
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,690
I'll do it. Grab a consent form.

357
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,340
Go!

358
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,450
We need to operate right now, okay?
Good to operate.

359
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,230
Repeat this, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.

360
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,200
No about it and no ifs.

361
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
Get her into O.R. 11.

362
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,030
Carotid dissection, four-inch pulsatile mass in her neck,

363
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,230
and some Broca's aphasia. It's got to be a clot

364
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,340
keeping her from bleeding out. Pulse?

365
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,580
Bounding, four-plus. It was a three-plus 20 minutes ago.

366
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,680
20?

367
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,170
Thought she just got here.

368
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,410
That blood looks pretty dry.

369
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,490
Cut yourself shaving?

370
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,350
You know, that can happen

371
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,630
when the nun you woke up with coughs blood on you.

372
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,870
You slept with a nun?

373
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,530
Forget nun, you slept with a patient? Former, to both.

374
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,130
Internal neck trauma, that's impressive.

375
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,150
It's happened to me a few times.

376
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,400
Up high.

377
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,130
Dr. Chase.

378
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,290
Clot's broken. Bring her in and pack her nose.

379
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,160
I'm gonna need number three Vicryls.

380
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,320
I'm gonna fix this. You're not gonna operate on her.

381
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,060
Kapur and Carlyle are unavailable. Reilly's done far fewer dissections than I have.

382
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,080
He's also slept with her far fewer times than you have.

383
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,400
Your judgment's compromised.
I spent the night with her.

384
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,140
Doesn't change how I make an incision.

385
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,580
Tell him!

386
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,020
Do the surgery.

387
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,030
You're trying to score points with him at the risk of a patient's life.

388
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,990
He's the better surgeon.

389
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,310
Vascular clamp. You're not gonna put her on bypass?

390
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,000
It'd take a half hour to set up. You clamp now, she could stroke out.

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,370
She's already got neurological symptoms.

392
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,620
We wait 30 minutes, she'll definitely have brain damage.
You're trying to make sure she's either perfect or dead.

393
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,590
She's not going to die. If I get this done in five minutes, she won't stroke out.

394
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,020
You don't know that you will.

395
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,160
And you can't know because you can't think clearly about her.

396
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,660
Vascular clamp.

397
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,450
Occlusion time 9:46 and 23 seconds.

398
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,010
Vascular scissors.

399
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,510
We're over five minutes.

400
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,690
Ultrasound.

401
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,210
Good flow. Lighten the anesthesia.

402
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,640
You're not gonna close the wound first?

403
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,530
No.

404
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,650
Can you hear me?

405
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,530
Repeat this,

406
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,630
no ifs, ands, or buts.

407
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,240
No ifs, ands, or buts.

408
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,320
I'm sorry about before.

409
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,940
You're scared, aren't you?

410
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,230
That's why you wanted companionship.

411
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,980
That's why you cried out when House shot at Taub.

412
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,340
What exactly are you scared of? A needle stick?

413
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,750
Some other nut pulling a scalpel?

414
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,060
I'm scared of everything.

415
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,680
It sucks that there was a stabbing. But you'll get over it.

416
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,950
Like you have? You weren't even there.

417
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,240
I know, I... I left the room.

418
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,620
It was pure luck.

419
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,810
I was in the room. That was pure luck too.

420
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,170
I get that you're scared and guilty.
You're still a doctor.

421
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,710
I don't have time to teach you to act like one.

422
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,200
We removed the artery.

423
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,930
I found nodules. Could mean lupus.

424
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,580
Negative A.N.A. Where are you going?

425
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,560
Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly

426
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,310
where he's gonna end up.

427
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,350
Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work

428
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,560
is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.

429
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,370
And then...

430
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,530
Two to the head.

431
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,710
Can we talk about my patient? Quite a journey.

432
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,550
Starts with a surgical tool in your heart and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun.

433
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,410
What's the plan? Plan's to cure her.

434
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,000
Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game.

435
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,640
You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile. You sure you want...

436
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,450
Oh, my God.

437
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,050
Taub is interrogating the janitor.

438
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,330
He must think that I hired him to attack...

439
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,040
actually, why didn't I do that?

440
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,170
Plaques could be confused for nodules.

441
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,090
- Which would mean... - Syphilis.

442
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,450
Explains the shoulder and foot involvement.

443
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,030
Hope you practiced

444
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,050
the immaculate contraception.

445
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,300
Lock and load.

446
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,380
Boo-yah 

447
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,350
Boo-yah to you too.

448
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,710
But I hadn't had sex in years.

449
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,900
Tertiary syphilis means you've had the disease for at least that long.

450
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,790
Does that mean you also have it?

451
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,430
Probably not contagious at this point.

452
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,190
Can it cause hallucinations?

453
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,590
It's unlikely. Why?

454
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,220
While I was on the operating table, it didn't feel like a dream.

455
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:36,180
I saw the boy who I was caring for.

456
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,360
The one who died.

457
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,310
He walked right up to me.

458
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,660
What did he say?

459
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,020
He just held my hand.

460
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,740
It was like he forgave me.

461
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,660
Do you think that's crazy?

462
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,850
I think it should give you solace,

463
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,490
help you to move on.

464
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,640
You slept with your patient?

465
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,140
You're off the case.

466
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,370
I saved her from brain damage.

467
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,180
You think my judgment's the least bit compromised?

468
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,780
She's still sick.

469
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,070
If she dies, we'll be in the middle of a brand-new investigation.

470
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,830
This is about you covering your own ass.

471
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,670
I gave you time, Leeway,

472
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,570
and you decided to do whatever the hell you wanted.

473
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,460
House can dance all over the rules, gets me knifed, and he gets a pass.

474
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,330
I break a rule, no one gets hurt,
but you kick me off my own case?

475
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,290
Unfortunately, yes.

476
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,620
I'm sorry. I took that scalpel for you.

477
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,890
That's why I did this.

478
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,240
Three weeks ago,
you never would have slept with a patient.

479
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,160
And you never would have operated on her after.

480
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,920
You need help.

481
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,290
I need to get away from House and everything that reminds me of him.

482
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,510
By breaking the rules, not caring what anyone else thinks.

483
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,880
You're gonna get away from him by turning into him?

484
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,300
It hurts.

485
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,920
Right upper quadrant, pain and distension.

486
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,990
What's wrong with my stomach?

487
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,040
Nothing. This is your liver.

488
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,340
The liver failure could be from intraoperative hypotension.

489
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,450
Checked the anesthesia sheet, pressure was fine throughout. Thrombus?

490
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,690
That voice in the hall that none of us

491
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,920
have any reason to be listening to is not surprisingly wrong.

492
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,090
Abdominal ultrasound was negative.
Then we have to assume liver failure

493
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,580
is just another symptom of whatever she's got.

494
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,580
Trousseau's syndrome could send clots, cause the ischemic foot.

495
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,160
Add the enlarged lymph node, macrocytosis.

496
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,210
Disseminated T-cell lymphoma. Wilson said it wasn't cancer.

497
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,560
Wilson says it's not breast cancer.

498
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,120
Sarcoidosis. Normal ace level.

499
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,560
Highly insensitive for sarcoid.

500
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,440
Negative chest X-rays aren't. Then we've got to biopsy.

501
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,080
Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.

502
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,140
You're clearly not grasping at straws
'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved.

503
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,860
I know you want to believe that this is something we can cure.

504
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,130
It's not. I'm sorry.

505
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,130
How soon will they know if it's cancer?

506
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,740
Within hours.

507
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,650
And if it is?

508
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,080
There's always chemo.

509
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,530
You say that like it's not gonna work.

510
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,340
Could extend your life.

511
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,600
Years?

512
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,560
I'll be here as much as you need.

513
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,390
You still never told me why you left the seminary.

514
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,190
Mary Knoller.

515
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,900
Wife of the groundskeeper.

516
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,060
He caught me with her, got me with a rake.

517
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,900
Those scars on my ass you may have noticed.

518
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,230
Why didn't you tell me that before?

519
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,890
Because it was so shallow.

520
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:46,260
I wasn't exactly wrestling with great theological questions.

521
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,350
I don't believe that.

522
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,190
You don't sleep with the groundskeeper's wife,

523
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,770
not unless you're struggling with whether you belong there.

524
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,670
I always wanted to believe.

525
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,690
Would have made my life a lot easier.

526
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,560
It never took.

527
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,290
Doesn't...

528
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,320
Mean...

529
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,300
It's too late.
Are you having trouble talking, like before?

530
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:22,020
I can get the words out. Just feels heavy when I do.

531
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,240
Where?

532
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,610
Wherever my chewing muscles are.

533
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,180
I'll be right back.

534
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,480
House finally got you.

535
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,090
- He tried but... - I gotta go.

536
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,340
You shoulda seen it. It was perfect.

537
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,890
She has jaw claudication.

538
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,190
If you only heard claudication and carotid dissection...

539
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,180
I'd say giant cell arteritis.

540
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,130
And I'd tell your former teammates to put her on steroids.

541
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,280
She's gonna live.

542
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,130
Yeah.
And then what?

543
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,380
They say my liver function's better. That I can get out of here soon.

544
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,620
And when you do, I'm gonna take you to puerto escondido.

545
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,570
Mexico? The Mexican pipeline.

546
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,630
Early may is when the surf really picks up but...

547
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,930
what's wrong?

548
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,640
I spoke to the prioress.

549
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,480
You're going back?

550
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,730
I felt the calling. When you saw the boy.

551
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,900
I felt God's love, his grace.

552
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,460
I've been waiting my entire life for that. It's not real.

553
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,050
I know you didn't feel anything when you almost died.

554
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,020
I did. You felt oxygen depravation.

555
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,780
You felt your brain releasing noradrenaline.

556
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,870
You didn't say that before.

557
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,680
I wanted you to move on with your life.

558
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,910
I wanted to reassure you.

559
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,000
I wanted you to feel better.

560
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,200
And now you don't?

561
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,570
Now...

562
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,670
I think I love you.

563
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,550
"Noradrenaline and near-death experiences."

564
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,180
Oh, dear.

565
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,710
You saw God? She did.

566
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,920
She wants to go back to the monastery.

567
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,090
So now you're preparing a Powerpoint presentation

568
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,910
to keep her in your garden  of earthly delights. You're an idiot.

569
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,560
Because I found someone I love? Because you're an idiot.

570
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,870
At least you two have that in common.

571
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,020
Her feelings are based on a chemical process.

572
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,960
They're gonna wear off. You just slept with her.

573
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,310
Your brain is exploding with oxytocin.

574
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,900
You think that's gonna last through the ages?

575
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,280
She's throwing away her life because of blind faith.

576
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,560
So are you!

577
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,640
She's found something she wants to build her life around.

578
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,990
It's a total illusion, but apparently she'll take a little ignorance with her bliss.

579
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,720
And you want to take that away?

580
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,260
How many times have you thrown the truth in people's faces?

581
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,130
Because it's the truth, not because we're gonna live happily ever after.

582
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,030
Either your relationship just blows up

583
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,330
like every other non-magical romance,

584
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,350
or she stays with you but blames you for stripping all the meaning out of her life.

585
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,030
This has nothing to do with the truth.

586
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,310
You don't like that I'm reassessing my life,

587
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,970
that I want to change it, that I can.

588
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,010
Anyone can screw up a life. I never said that wasn't possible.

589
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,200
You're incapable of human connection,

590
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,570
so you want everyone to be like you.

591
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,390
If I wanted you to be like me...

592
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,260
I would be urging you to make a stupid, stubborn decision

593
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,750
that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable.

594
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,060
You reassess your life when you've made mistakes.

595
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,730
You didn't. You just got stabbed.

596
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,410
Don't look at the book.

597
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,980
I haven't done a jugular line since my residency. I don't want to needle the carotid.

598
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,480
What's the first step?

599
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,480
Palpate the S.C.M.

600
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,870
Where?

601
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,440
Middle third of the neck.

602
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,860
I'm happy I knew you.

603
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,310
So am I.

604
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,270
Robert.

605
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:19,320
24-year-oldwater treatment worker with pyrexia and double vision.

606
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,110
Abscess?

607
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,770
Would have seen it on the MRI.

608
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,960
Diphtheria paralyzing the ocular muscles? No, paralysis was first.

609
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,250
- Aneurysm? - Not with this fever.

610
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,660
Maybe we're thinking about this the wrong way. Retro-ocular infection?

611
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,890
With no local symptoms?

612
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:10,860
