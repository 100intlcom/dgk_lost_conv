1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,600
Attention, passengers...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,400
You have to lift up the sign so he can see it.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,100
Evan.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey, buddy.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,600
Aren't you excited to see your Uncle Brant? No.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
No?

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,200
I think you are.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,200
I think something else is making you upset.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,300
You know I'm leaving soon, and it's okay to be upset about that,

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,000
but, hey, do you remember what I told you when we were watching wrestling on Saturday night?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,300
Yeah.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,500
That you and Uncle Brant are like the Reaper Brothers. That's right.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,300
And Uncle Brant has been in the ring
a whole year.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,700
Now it's time for daddy to tag in. But while I'm away,

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
I need you in your Uncle's corner,

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,500
making sure he keeps you and your mom safe.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,300
Can you help me with that?

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,300
Good.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,400
Now let's get ready with that sign.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,000
Attention, ladies and gentlemen, we are now boarding at Gate 47.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,500
Now.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,500
Brant, what happened?

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,800
Captain, please step aside. Sir, this is my brother.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
What's going on? Pfc Macklin has been charged with treason.

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
Oh, so there's got to be some mistake.

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,700
Brant!

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Brant! Brant!

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,800

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,800
<i>Army apparently thought they were clearing</i> <i>an insurgent hideout.</i>

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,700
<i>After this was leaked on Saturday,</i> <i>the A.P. investigated.</i>

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,700
<i>34 civilian casualties.</i>

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,600
Six kids.

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,600
There will be MPs stationed at every entrance to the second floor, as well as outside his patient room.

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,700
No. Don't do that.

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,600
Every time there's people in uniform in the cafeteria,

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,500
they get served first. Make sure your IDs are clearly visible.

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,800
I'll speak with the cafeteria staff about showing more disrespect.

41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,000
20-year-old male, generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,200
Army Docs scanned for structural abnormalities.

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,100
EEG was normal. So was- do you need me to sign for this?

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
Let me know if you need anything.

45
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,300
Like a transfer.

46
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,300
Typhus?
<i>Patient has no hair.</i>

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,000
Probably means no lice.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,100
Leishmaniasis.
No fever.

49
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,200
Why couldn't they take care of him at a military hospital?

50
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,400
I think because they wanted to annoy you.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,700
Any other conscientious objectors?

52
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,500
So I'm the only one <i>who has a problem when someone</i>

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,800
whose duty's to protect our country blowing-

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,200
Blowing the whistle is honorable precisely because it's not dutiful.

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Sorry, you said blowing.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Maybe you were going somewhere else with that.
He's a coward.

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,100
He risked his freedom. He anonymously downloaded a computer file

58
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,200
from a secure page and uploaded it to an unsecure page.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,300
<i>Not exactly storming Omaha Beach.</i>

60
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,000
The EEG was normal because he was faking it <i>to avoid going to prison.</i>

61
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,500
Let's treat him with not medicine.

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,800
Give those back. Why? You got 28.

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,700
You can share. Something's going on with House.

64
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,800
He just seemed off.

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Didn't even notice that I walked out
of the room with this.

66
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,700
You began to suspect he was off when he didn't notice the mug you stole to see if he was off?

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,000
What else didn't he notice that you don't want us to notice?

68
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,400
Those are the same clothes you wore yesterday.

69
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,800
And you got very defensive when House took your birth control.

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,900
Who was he? Or better yet... she?

71
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,800
Do I need to explain the physiology behind birth control?

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,000
Attention deficit in a man who has no attention deficits has to be symptomatic of something.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,600
You're right. I'm thinking either massive brain tumor,

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,500
or his soap got canceled and he's distracted.

75
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,800
Could be dietary. Refsum.

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,300
Or maybe he thinks you just have

77
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,600
more than one non-descript white blouse.

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,100
Or serotonin syndrome.

79
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,900
I'm not saying he's definitely sick. I'm just saying we should look into it.

80
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,200
No, we shouldn't.

81
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,400
If you believe House is sick, it's only because that's what he wants you to believe.

82
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Let's go.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,300
We think the long flight home allowed clots to form in your leg.

84
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,600
Take this pill.

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,800
If you feel any numbness in your leg after a few minutes,

86
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
it means we're right and you should get comfortable, because you're gonna be here for a while.

87
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,500
While we wait, can you tell me why?

88
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,100
It was the right thing to do.

89
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,300
There are reports that insurgents are using your video to recruit new members.

90
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,000
Making the voting public aware of what's really happening on the ground will help bring our troops home fast.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,000
My brother's grunt means he disagrees. I think you're being naive.

92
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,500
<i>And I know you took an oath.</i>

93
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,300
If you want to influence policy, run for office.

94
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,300
Dad raised us to believe that exposing the truth is honorable.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Hayes likes to follow the rules.

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,300
Yeah, because that's what Dad taught us was honorable. You were ten when he died.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,900
You couldn't possibly have any idea-

98
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,000
If dad always believe in blindly following the rules, how do you explain Tora Bora?

99
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,300
My dad was commanding a Special Forces unit.

100
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,200
He was ordered to abandon them and focus on the primary mission.

101
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,700
He disobeyed that order, <i>went and found his men still alive and fighting.</i>

102
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,800
He saved their lives. Did he die in service?

103
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,100
<i>If it was something genetic, it could help us.</i>

104
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,000
<i>It won't help.</i> It was a one-car accident.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,800
That's the army's official story. My brother's naive on this and...

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,300
I can't feel my leg.

107
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll get the discharge papers.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,700
I have a blood clot. No, you don't.

109
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,800
We gave you a placebo to see if you'd fake another symptom to delay going to prison.

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,500
Wait a second. He's not faking.

111
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,000
Because that's not the way your Dad raised him?

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,700
Yes.

113
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300
<i>My stomach hurts too.</i>

114
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,000
What's going on?

115
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,800
He's not faking.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,600
<i>Just because he's got abdominal bruising</i> <i>doesn't mean he wasn't faking the numbness.</i>

117
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,400
<i>He's not contesting the treason charges.</i>

118
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,100
<i>If his code of honor is that strong,</i> <i>he's not gonna bother faking symptoms.</i>

119
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,700
Pleading guilty is not honorable. It's just stupid.

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,300
A distal esophageal rupture can lead to compartment syndrome

121
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,800
in his thigh- explains both symptoms.

122
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,000
No pain when he swallows. <i>What is honor?</i>

123
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,600
Dying for your country? Getting straight As?

124
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Killing your daughter because she had the audacity to get raped?

125
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Ruptured triple-A. Doesn't explain the seizures.

126
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,700
Pancreatitis.

127
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,200
Gallstones obstructing his pancreatic duct.

128
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
People define honor

129
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,000
as whatever makes them feel honorable.

130
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,600
It's a circle going nowhere.

131
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,800
Which I guess is what circles do.
We'll ultrasound his belly and look for the obstruction.

132
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,900
I need your signature on this order.

133
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,200
The Army's leaning on Foreman to make sure this is done by the book.

134
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Didn't need an order for his last treatment.
This last treatment wasn't a treatment.

135
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,400
- Forge it. - I will.

136
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,500
From now on.

137
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,800
But I need the original so I know what to forge.

138
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,100
We were having coffee when the dizziness started.
Business meeting?

139
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,200
Date. Our first.

140
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,400
We met at the 98 Cents store. <i>We were reaching for the same tube of cheese.</i>

141
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,500
I'm sorry. Yeah.

142
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,100
I need to talk to you.
Just about done.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,200
Good news, based on her thrifty shopping habits and taste for artificial dairy,

144
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,100
she's clearly not a gold digger.

145
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
<i>Bad news:</i>

146
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,200
Based on his rhinotillexomania, he is.

147
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Compulsive addiction to nose-picking.
A small cut on the inside of the left nostril

148
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,300
led to an infection in the cavernous sinus.

149
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,700
It was very nice meeting you, Mel.
It's not true.

150
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,700
Gloria, wait,

151
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,000
I can change.

152
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,200
My PPTH contract. House signed it six months ago.

153
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,500
He signed this today.

154
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
His hands are unsteady.

155
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,300
Given his Vicodin abuse, I think he has hepatic encephalopathy.

156
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,100
He's been forgetful, inattentive.

157
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,800
Dominika's been trying out new knish recipes. One of them didn't agree with him.

158
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,700
A little sleep deprivation could account for his forgetfulness and inattention.

159
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,300
He loads up on caffeine. That explains a jittery hand.

160
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,800
Maybe. But if I'm right, his liver's in decline.

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,300
It's curable, but if he doesn't get treatment,

162
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,900
it could actually be fatal.

163
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,100
This happens all the time. One of the symptoms of working for House-

164
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,800
you start seeing zebras everywhere. There's nothing wrong with him.

165
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,600
House.

166
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
Shh. I'm with a patient.

167
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,600
Sleep study.

168
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
You drugged him?

169
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,500
I didn't say the study was voluntary.

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,300
I think you're sick.

171
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,400
What, 'cause I'm sleeping in the clinic like I always do?

172
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,900
Slow reaction time.

173
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,100
Because I just woke up from sleeping in the clinic like I always do.

174
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,500
You're forgetful.

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Sorry. What did you say? You forgot that we were supposed to have lunch.

176
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,900
I didn't forget. I was sleeping in the clinic-

177
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,500
I'd like to run some tests. For what?

178
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,200
Where's this coming from?

179
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,300
Hepatic encephalopathy.
I've watched you destroy your body with Vicodin for years.

180
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm surprised your liver's lasted this long.

181
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,600
I'll do the examination myself.

182
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,400
While having you juggle my jewels sounds interesting,

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,300
there's no such thing as friends with benefits.

184
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,200
It always gets weird.

185
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,500
Your friends out there are getting a little handsy.

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,500
Get enough death threats, eventually they start taking them seriously.

187
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,600
A convoy was hit outside of Kunar Province.

188
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,100
<i>Eight American soldiers were killed.</i>

189
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,700
Army spokesperson's claiming that it's revenge for the attack that I made public.

190
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,000
<i>Better me take the blame than them.</i>
You don't think you're to blame at all?

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
And you do.

192
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,800
<i>Like everyone else.</i>

193
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,100
A strike like that would take more than three days to plan.
So the next one might be your fault?

194
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
Lateral view looks good.

195
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
If you have such a negative opinion of the army, why did you enlist?

196
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,800
I needed to find out what really happened to my dad.

197
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,000
There were two redacted pages in his service record.

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
<i>Going into intelligence was the quickest way</i> <i>to up my security clearance.</i>

199
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,100
Then why would you leak that video?

200
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,800
Part of my job was to grab a cup of tea with the locals.

201
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,400
The face time is supposed to make them more likely

202
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,600
to trust us with sensitive information,
but they became my friends.

203
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,500
<i>If there was another attack,</i> <i>civilian casualties,</i>

204
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,200
and I had done nothing... Your spleen, it's enlarged.

205
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,100
We should do a biopsy and look for any- He's got urinary bleeding.

206
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,900
<i>Not just urinary.</i> Call the blood bank.

207
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,400
<i>What's happening to him?</i>

208
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,200
His spleen must be sequestering platelets.

209
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,800
He's bleeding too fast to wait for a platelet infusion.

210
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,200
We need to squeeze his spleen to release the ones he's got.

211
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
Tell the O.R. we're on our way.

212
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,700
<i>Pressure's dropping.</i> <i>Almost there.</i>

213
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,400
BP's 70 over 40, <i>and he's hypovolemic.</i>

214
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,000
Pressure's rising. And he's starting to clot.

215
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,800
Good news is we can control the bleeding.

216
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,300
Bad news is...

217
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,700
Bleeding's not the problem.

218
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,000
Unless spleens are supposed to be lumpy.

219
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,700
<i>He's clotting, but CT confirms</i> <i>splenic nodules.</i>

220
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,100
Dr. Taub has an interesting theory.

221
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,800
No, I don't. You're forfeiting?

222
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
'Cause if you can't play the game and work...

223
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,400
Extramedullary hematopoiesis. No history of anemia.

224
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,600
She's right. You're an idiot. Try again.

225
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
Where I come from, this is called cheating.

226
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,700
Where's that? Stickford-upon-anus?

227
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,500
TB. PPD's negative.

228
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,800
Could be bru- Don't interrupt Dr. Taub.

229
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,800
Brucellosis.

230
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,700
You just took out a family of four. They were clearly armed insurgents,

231
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,400
and anyone who claims or proves otherwise is a traitor.

232
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,500
No rash or back pain.

233
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,800
You defend the patient for being a whistleblower,

234
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,600
then attack him for being an honorable whistleblower.

235
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,700
Now you defend him for being a maligned, honorable whistleblower?

236
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,200
<i>Adjectives matter.</i>
Hate nurses, love naughty nurses.

237
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
Taub, pitch again.

238
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,000
- I've pitched like five- - It's your turn.

239
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,300
Lymphoma.

240
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,800
<i>If cancer caused his seizures,</i> <i>we would have seen cerebral masses on his head CT.</i>

241
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,400
- Yes! - Taub, pitch again.

242
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,600
Now.

243
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,500
The nodules in his spleen were granulomas.

244
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
He's got sarcoidosis!

245
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,900
Someone tell him he's wrong. Sorry, House.

246
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Sarcoid does explain the seizures. And the bruises.

247
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,100
Say bye-bye, House.

248
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Yes!

249
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,600
Sarcoidosis it is.
Treat with steroids.

250
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,300
<i>Then come right back here,</i>

251
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,400
<i>'cause I'm not gonna rest until I've made orphans</i> of all your virtual children.

252
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,100
House never loses. Seriously?

253
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,600
Me beating House is medically significant?

254
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,000
It could be. Reduced fine motor control.

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Add that to inattention and liver flap.

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,900
It does make sense.

257
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,900
We have to talk to Foreman.
No, we don't.

258
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,100
First of all, because I can beat him in that game.

259
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,000
And, second, even if you are right, there's no reason to believe

260
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
that House's medical judgment is impaired.

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,500
So we should wait until he kills someone for confirmation?

262
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,200
You really think it's a coincidence that we're treating a whistleblower

263
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,400
and now talking about blowing the whistle on House? You're right.

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,400
Playing dumb, messy signature, losing a video game-

265
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,700
it's way too complicated to fake.

266
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,600
No. I won't take it.

267
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,800
Without this injection, you could have a fatal arrhythmia.

268
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,700
Tell Major Mathewson that I'm not taking any more treatment

269
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,100
until they give me a live television interview.

270
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,800
You can't really think they'll agree to that.

271
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,400
People need to know the tape's not the reason for that attack.

272
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,700
They need to know why I did this.

273
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,900
<i>The people who think you're a traitor</i> will still think you're a traitor,

274
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,200
and the people who think you're a hero will still think you're a hero.

275
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,100
The truth makes a difference.

276
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,900
If Dad were here, he'd be begging for you not to do this.

277
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,300
If Dad were here, he'd be proud of me.

278
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,500
The conspiracy theorists are gonna go nuts if the patient dies.

279
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,000
I told him that, and he told me that option is still less damaging

280
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
than giving the kid a national platform. So what do we do now?

281
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,700
You explain to your brother that he overplayed his hand.

282
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,600
That won't make any difference.
The idiot thinks he's doing the right thing.

283
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,000
What if we convinced a court that his refusal is part of an underlying psychiatric disorder?

284
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,300
<i>They assign a conservator. We do what we want.</i>

285
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
Fraud. Great.

286
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,700
Narcissistic personality disorder.

287
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,100
<i>Both the leaking of the tape and the refusal of treatment</i> indicate that he has no fear of consequences.

288
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,700
<i>So instead of defrauding the court,</i> <i>you'll waste their time?</i>

289
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,000
No way a judge classifies a personality disorder as a mental illness.

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,200
If a decorated military officer, who happened to be the patient's brother, corroborates, they might.

291
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,200
So you want me to sign a piece of paper that says my brother is crazy

292
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,800
for doing what he thinks is right?

293
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,300
I want you to save his life. His heart could go at any time.

294
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,300
He's a fool.

295
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,100
But he's not crazy.

296
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
The patient was refusing treatment
because of honor, and his brother

297
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,500
is refusing to be his conservator because of honor. Oh, good.

298
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,800
Taub's cured the patient. I had to go to the bathroom.

299
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Bathroom's that way. You just ran in from that way.
That one's been out of order for two days.

300
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,200
I had to go up to the third floor.

301
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm not lying. It's out of order.

302
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,800
I believe you. I'm gonna fix it.

303
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,300
We could treat if he doesn't know he's being treated. Lace his sponge bath.

304
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,500
It would take too long to reach his bloodstream.

305
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,500
What if we aerosolize steroids and blast the room?
Speaking of which...

306
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,100
It'd be too hard to get the prednisone concentrations right.

307
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,900
OUT OF ORDER

308
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,800
No one fixes anything unless they have a compelling reason.

309
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,800
If we're gonna treat,

310
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,200
<i>we have to give him a compelling reason,</i>

311
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,400
<i>something that he wants more than an interview.</i>

312
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,200
<i>Fire in the hole!</i>

313
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,500
<i>A signed order from Major Mathewson.</i>

314
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,900
They've agreed to declassify the redacted pages from your father's service record.

315
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,800
In two days, you'll have all your answers.

316
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,800
But the only way you'll live long enough to get the truth is by accepting treatment.

317
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,900
I don't trust the Army to follow through on this. But you trust me.

318
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,900
I'll make sure those pages get here.

319
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,000
Okay.

320
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,200
Selfishness is apparently honorable now.

321
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,400
He wanted to create change. Instead, he's just satisfying his own curiosity.

322
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,600
He's getting the truth. Most he could hope for.

323
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,900
I need to take a dump.

324
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,900
Specifically, House's dump.

325
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,100
You set this up?

326
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,600
All it took was showing up two minutes late and a $2 sign.

327
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,200
Bile deposits are irregular.

328
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,600
House's liver is failing.

329
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,500
Cognitive impairment will get progressively worse.

330
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,900
What's going on?
My foot.

331
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,300
It's killing me. <i>It's completely cyanotic.</i>

332
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,400
This isn't sarcoidosis.

333
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,100
Cholesterol embolization.

334
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,400
Are you gonna even acknowledge what we just told you?

335
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,200
That you pilfered my poo-poo?

336
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,800
Yeah, I was thinking it would be less awkward

337
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,100
for all of us if we could just pretend that never happened.

338
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,500
<i>It's not an embolization.</i> No instrumentation inside the arteries.

339
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Thank you for getting us back-

340
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,700
And if we start you on treatment now, get you off Vicodin-

341
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,300
What's the opposite of "thank you"?
I'm pretty sure it ends in "you".

342
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,500
<i>I know my body. I'm fine.</i>

343
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Methemoglobinemia.

344
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,400
Army tests for G6PD deficiency.

345
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,100
If you're not sick,

346
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,200
then our test, accurate 99.5% of the time,

347
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,800
yielded a false positive three separate times.

348
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,800
The odds of that are 1 in 8 million.
The test is accurate. The diagnosis isn't.

349
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,300
Sample was obviously contaminated with other foods interacting with my liver enzymes.

350
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,100
Now could we talk about the sick patient? His clot dissolved.

351
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>That could have caused the vasospasm.</i>

352
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,500
D.I.C. could have been caused by Bernard Soulier syndrome.

353
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,300
And you're sick,

354
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,900
<i>and you have to do something about it.</i>

355
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,400
If we had a patient file with the same symptoms you're exhibiting...

356
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,500
And the symptoms I'm not exhibiting? Jaundice, ascites, fetor hepaticus.

357
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,000
We can't tell if your breath stinks because you've been popping mints like they're Vicodin.

358
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,300
<i>You'd still diagnose hepatic encephalopathy.</i>

359
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,700
I know that because four doctors you trained have unanimously diagnosed you with hepatic encephalopathy.

360
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,310


361
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,100
Park's right. Treat the patient with Heparin.

362
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,800
We'll have a stronger argument if we go to Foreman as a united front.

363
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,700
We'll have a stronger argument if we have an argument.

364
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,200
If House is sick, it's his business, not Foreman's.

365
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,800
Foreman's business is to make sure his doctors are able to do their jobs, that lives aren't put at risk.

366
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,900
Telling Foreman will put lives at risk.

367
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,700
We tell Foreman, House either agrees to treatment
or get suspended, which means House gets suspended.

368
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,800
And considering House at 90% is better than any other doctor at this hospital at 100%,

369
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,900
that means our patients get a lower standard of care.

370
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,300
House could be at 90%, he could be at 60%, we don't know.

371
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,700
And until we do, there's no reason to do anything more than what we've done.

372
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,100
<i>Blurry vision...</i>

373
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,400
headache, a bit of nausea, and dizziness.

374
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,600
I am completely baffled.

375
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I only had eight beers.

376
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,100
Sophomore class pong tournament's in a week.

377
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm working on my tolerance.

378
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,400
<i>Hop on one foot and singe the iCarly theme song.</i>

379
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,700
Like you don't know it.

380
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,600
Damn it, man. Can't you see I'm doctoring?

381
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,500
If you want to talk to me, you can buy me a sandwich in an hour.

382
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,900
Or I could just hover here until you're done.

383
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,400
Heard enough.

384
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,000
Just never could figure out the "breathe air" part.

385
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,900
Next year, stick to whiskey.

386
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Or at least stay away from week-old green beers.

387
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,000
A lot less likely to contain tartrazine-laced green food dyes

388
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,300
for which you apparently have an intolerance.

389
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,900
<i>Once you break the seal,</i>
it'll be out of your system in 48 hours.

390
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,700
What are my choices here?

391
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,500
If I tell you I'm fine, you won't believe me.

392
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,400
I've scheduled a liver function test.

393
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,200
If I ignore you, then you'll just ignore my ignoring.

394
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
Which is rude, frankly.

395
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
Depending on the results, we'll customize a treatment plan.

396
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,000
If I tell you I think I'm sick and I need your help and we need to set up a time to talk about it,

397
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,500
you'll just assume I'm lying.

398
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,700
Again, rude. Also hurtful.

399
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,000
Why is it that you can find the smallest thing wrong
with anyone else, but when it comes to you...

400
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,900
I really don't have a choice here, do I?

401
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,400
No, you don't.

402
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,700
I'm on the list. But he's not.

403
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,200
You can't ignore me forever.

404
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Well, if you're right, that's not gonna be all that long.

405
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,700
Do it slow.

406
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,800
Who are you?

407
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,400
Well, considering the only people allowed

408
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,800
in this room are your doctors and your family...

409
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,200
I'm your long-lost cousin Ralph.

410
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,000
So glad to finally meet you.

411
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Are you gonna check on me?

412
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,700
It's gonna be at least two hours until we can tell if the Heparin's working.

413
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,400
Then what are you doing here?

414
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
You know, my father taught me that it's dishonorable

415
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,900
to interrupt someone when they're reading.

416
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,700
Honor's not a punch line. Get out of my room.

417
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,400
So was it worth it?

418
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,900
Best case, you spend the rest of your life in Leavenworth.

419
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,300
Worst case, you spend the rest of your life here.

420
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,200
Justice for 34 deaths outweighs anything the Army can do to me.

421
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,800
<i>They got justice?</i> Do they know that?

422
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,800
What if only ten people had died?

423
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,600
Four? Even one civilian death...

424
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,700
What if they just maimed a few guys? Would that have been worth it?

425
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,400
My job was to log that tape,

426
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,700
get all the details in the official record.

427
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,500
After the tenth time of watching it, I stopped trying to convince myself

428
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,400
that the shovel could have been mistaken for a gun.

429
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,400
'Cause all I could see were the victims' faces.

430
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,300
All I was doing was trying to read that kid's lips

431
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,600
to make out his last words.

432
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,400
I couldn't sleep.

433
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,600
Couldn't eat.

434
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,400
Think I like the cue ball look?

435
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,800
My hair turned gray in three days.

436
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,500
My body was telling me I had to do whatever I could

437
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,900
to make sure that something like this never happened again.

438
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Your hair turned gray in three days.

439
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,900
Loss of hair color indicates an autoimmune condition, likely Grave's disease.

440
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,100
Hyperthyroidism leads to a hypercoagulable state,

441
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
which causes thrombosis.

442
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,800
Start him on antithyroids.

443
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,400
You want to reject our current diagnosis because he had a few gray hairs,

444
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
panicked, and shaved his head?

445
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,800
I want to reject our current diagnosis because I think we're wrong.

446
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,700
And treating for wrong diagnoses can result in side effects like death.

447
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,500
Even if he did full go gray, stress seems way more likely than Grave's.

448
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,100
I haven't read any journal articles proving that veterans have a higher incidence of depigmentation.

449
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,700
Of course, that could be the hepatic encephalopathy talking.

450
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,900
Our treatment for Bernard Soulier hasn't had time-
so you all just want to ignore the new symptom?

451
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,500
It's not grave's because it's not a symptom at all.

452
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,300
And the antithyroids you want could reduce his blood pressure

453
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,900
and his ability to breathe.

454
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,500
Which can result in side effects, like death.
Small soda.

455
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,400
Grave's it is. Start him on antithyroids.

456
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,300
I know we disagree with House all the time,

457
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,600
but, before I could say, "okay, he's a genius. "

458
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Now... maybe he's just really smart.

459
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,300
We're not gonna give him the antithyroids.

460
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,700
Everything okay? Any better?

461
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,000
Pretty good. He did just ask me for a blanket.

462
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,200
You're cold? A little.

463
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,300
For how long?

464
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,800
<i>It's really nothing.</i> Maybe an hour or two.

465
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,800
He's at 104.

466
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,500
It's not Bernard Soulier.

467
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,100
Bold move. You've gone from speculating I'm sick,

468
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,700
to acting like I'm dead.

469
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,200
We acted like we don't trust your judgement, because we don't trust your judgement.

470
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,400
Why don't you start by not trusting your own.

471
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,300
We did more blood work, it's not Graves either.

472
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,600
Talk to you for a minute?

473
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,900
Anything you have to say to me, you can say to them.

474
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,300
It's only fair. Cause anything they say to me, they also say to you.

475
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,700
Jiggle your pockets. Whose got the silver coin?

476
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,000
Until you receive a clean bill of health, I'll be authorizing all treatment orders.

477
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,500
Well, I would say that that was an incredibly stupid mistake,

478
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,900
but apparently I'd have to clear that opinion through Foreman first.

479
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,100
White count is high.

480
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,800
So all the infections we ruled out when he came in are back on the table.

481
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,900
Legionnaire's. Unlikely without pneumonia.

482
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,100
<i>Taub.</i>

483
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,700
Loyalty issues in his personal life.

484
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,300
Makes sense that they'd cross over into his professional one.

485
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,500
I was hoping we can get a diagnosis before the witch hunt.

486
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,200
The patient's infection
is an inherently less interesting puzzle

487
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,100
than the stab wound to my back.

488
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,400
Fine. I told Foreman.

489
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,900
Can we move on now? What about dengue?

490
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,300
Patient isn't in enough pain. <i>No.</i>

491
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,400
I don't mean about dengue. I have no idea.

492
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,600
<i>Taub's only confessing because he wants us</i> to focus on the patient.

493
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,200
I told Foreman. I did.

494
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,600
The next person to confess is fired.

495
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,300
Or Spartacus. For clarification, no one's getting fired.

496
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,000
Who else has a pitch?

497
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,400
And then... there's Park.

498
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,700
The only one who didn't confess.

499
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,300
The same cowardice that makes someone unable

500
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,000
to move out of mommy and daddy's home might also make someone a tattletale.

501
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You threatened to fire the next person who- And it's malaria.

502
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,400
No, it's not.

503
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,400
The Army issues anti-malaria medication. And has done for ten years.

504
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,400
That's the equivalent of 5,000 generations <i>of the Afghan mosquito, anopheles gambiae.</i>

505
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,800
That's plenty long enough to develop a resistance.

506
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
<i>Anopheles, by the way, is Greek for "useless. "</i>

507
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,600
Cover for intra-abdominal sepsis and treat with antimalarials.

508
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,200
<i>And was I also right</i> that it was a stupid idea?

509
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
We believe you have malaria.

510
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,700
These pills-

511
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,100
I don't want any medication.

512
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,000
My dad's file should have been here.

513
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Brant, I told you, I looked into it.

514
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,100
There's just a delay.

515
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
I believe that's what the Army's saying.

516
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
I don't believe it's true.

517
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,300
If they're not going to keep their end of the bargain,

518
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
neither am I.

519
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,000
So we got groped for nothing. If he doesn't want to stay alive-

520
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,900
Hold on.

521
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,900
Is it too late to become his conservator?

522
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,400
I know what I said before.

523
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,200
Right now I don't care.

524
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,500
Of course not. We'll get the paperwork drawn up.

525
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,300
He changed his mind?

526
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Why?

527
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,400
His brother's dying. He needs a more substantial reason?

528
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,600
His brother was dying the last time we asked him to be the conservator.

529
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,600
So instead of pushing the issue with the Army to get the file, he just decided to give up on his code?

530
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,100
Apparently.

531
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,100
So where do I sign?

532
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,400
We don't need you to.

533
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,500
The Army gave the file to you yesterday.

534
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,300
Major Mathewson had another copy sent over to us.

535
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,200
You know, there's a reason I didn't want that file released.

536
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,600
I know. I read it.

537
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,900
I'm gonna treat my patient now.

538
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,000
I was right.

539
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,700
Wasn't I?

540
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,900
How did he die?

541
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,600
What did they cover up?

542
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,800
They didn't cover up anything.

543
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,700
I did.

544
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,900
Dad died in that car accident because he was drunk.

545
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,800
Killed a pedestrian too.

546
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,600
What are you- what-

547
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,800
He drank, Brant, a lot.

548
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,600
You were too young to see it.

549
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,500
I, uh, I had some of dad's buddies...

550
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,900
take care of his files.

551
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,600
It was the only time I ever broke the rules.

552
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm sorry.

553
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,600
Can I begin treatment?

554
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,200
Fever hasn't broken. White count is still up.

555
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Renal function is declining.

556
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,100
<i>So he has all the signs of malaria,</i> <i>except the antimalarials aren't curing him.</i>

557
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,900
Gonorrhea? If it got into his heart...

558
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,800
We did an echo. His valves look good. What about-

559
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,200
you bastard.

560
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,300
You were faking.

561
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,800
Yesterday, House stole candy by putting it into a cup.

562
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,000
The cup was too small, so his solution was to remove some of the candy.

563
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,600
But the obviously logical thing was to just get a bigger cup,

564
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,500
which he did today, because he's no longer faking.

565
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,300
He couldn't have faked it. We tested your-

566
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,700
I took St. John's Wort to alter the way my liver metabolized acetaminophen.

567
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,600
Then some n-acetylcysteine just to finish it off.

568
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,600
You tortured them to torture me just to see who you could trust?

569
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
I did it to save lives.

570
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,700
God, I wish I could rationalize that one.

571
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,000
And now you're going to brilliantly deduce which one of us is the rat?

572
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,100
What makes you think I haven't already?

573
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,400
To be continued. I need to brilliantly cure a patient.

574
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,700
No hair usually means no lice.

575
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,800
What we didn't account for was that it wasn't your hair.

576
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,200
Tea was not the only thing that your Afghani neighbors shared with you.

577
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,300
I'm sure they were generous enough to let you sit on their furniture,

578
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,700
which was infested with rat lice.

579
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,900
You have typhus.

580
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,500
Caused the vasculitis and explains all your other symptoms.

581
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,600
But here's where it gets interesting.

582
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,000
One of those symptoms, a lawyer might argue,

583
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,400
was leaking the tape.

584
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,700
There are psychiatric issues associated with typhus.

585
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,100
<i>If you change your mind,</i> plead not guilty,

586
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,300
you've got a case.

587
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,700
I'd be undermining everything I've been trying to do.

588
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,300
You did what you thought you had to do.

589
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,900
Going to jail proves nothing.

590
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,300
It proves I still have my honor.

591
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,000
You're not doing this for honor.

592
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,500
You're doing this to please your father.

593
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,700
And the pathetic thing is that the man you're trying to please never existed.

594
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,400
Traitor.

595
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,800
You've been avoiding me for two days.

596
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,900
'Cause, when I stranded you behind the barricades, you went straight to Foreman.

597
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,800
I've been avoiding you because you're an ass.

598
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,800
I've been an ass my whole life. I can't get rid of you. You can get rid of me now.

599
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,300
Just turn and limp away.

600
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,500
Your whiny righteousness has the stench of sincerity.

601
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,600
Fine. I have to punish my whole team so that one of them will step forward.

602
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,300
Makes sense.

603
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,700
Damn.

604
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,900
Now I'm gonna have to punish my whole team so that one of them will step forward.

605
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,200
You just said that.

606
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, but I meant it this time.

607
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,200
First time I was just testing you.

608
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,500
Either you were gonna genuinely confess <i>or falsely confess</i>

609
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,000
or actually...

610
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,500
His name's li'I Chase.

611
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,900
He's a rat.

612
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,200
You're a rat.

613
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,300
Get it?

614
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,600
Taub confessed to telling Foreman to protect the patient.

615
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,200
Adams confessed to protect Taub.

616
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,200
But your confession was just piling on.

617
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,000
There's no rational reason for you to have done it.

618
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,200
And my punishment will be nothing.

619
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,300
You wanted me to tell Foreman.

620
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,900
Your ability to solve puzzles is the only thing that matters to you.

621
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,200
And you're smart enough to know

622
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
