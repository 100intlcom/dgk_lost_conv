1
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:18,887
"The Patuxent River Naval Air Station near D.C.

2
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:23,323
<i>Was commissioned in 1943 by John McCain's grandfather."</i>

3
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:26,282
I'm thinking of going hang gliding.

4
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:28,887
Pax river is, like, completely flat.

5
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:31,748
Think that's why they tested the V-22 Osprey there.

6
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:39,330
I like naval stuff. I like their oranges and lint.

7
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,401
<i>What looks like kidney disease, but isn't?</i>

8
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:43,546
<i>And where's Chase? Root canal and Berger's.</i>

9
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:46,644
The first one was regarding Chase. Root canal, if done correctly,

10
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:48,697
doesn't look like kidney disease.

11
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:52,176
Got a case for you. Smells funny.

12
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,837
Patient had an idiopathic anaphylactic reaction.

13
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:57,825
It stumped two E.R. docs and an immunologist from Johns Hopkins.

14
00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:00,940
Patient went from asymptomatic to fried kidneys in less than a year.

15
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:03,526
Stumped three internists and a department chair from Harvard.

16
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:05,984
14-year-old girl, intermittent attacks.

17
00:01:05,985 --> 00:01:09,260
Four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door.

18
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:19,284
This patient died five years ago.

19
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,976
I didn't say which side of the door he was on.

20
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:29,196
The fact that he's dead makes it more interesting.

21
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:31,903
Four-year-olds do not die of Berger's.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,424
I thought it was relevant. Death is a consequence, not a symptom.

23
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:42,026
If it's not a symptom, it's not relevant.

24
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,007
<i>Shouldn't we be trying to maximize</i> what we can save here?

25
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,296
14-year-old, your freom, our asses?

26
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,814
Right... Save your asses.

27

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,118
She was in a car accident when she was two.

31
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,523
She only had minor injuries, but her father died.

32
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,259
That was 12 years ago. You think that's pertinent?

33
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,188
No, I think it's sad.

34
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:44,779
She got sick in the middle of her 14th birthday party.

35
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,665
Which is sad and pertinent.
Maybe she was opening a present that triggered the reaction.

36
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,983
- Where's House? - Pissing contest with foreman.

37
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:55,458
Last thing she ate was strawberry cake,
<i>but allergy tests for everything were negative.</i>

38
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,547
Do you like your dentist? I'm still going to my pediatric one.

39
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:00,018
What's your dentist's name?

40
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:04,050
Williams. <i>What if it's not an allergic reaction?</i>

41
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,907
<i>Hereditary angioedema</i> or systemic mastocytosis could mimic anaphylaxis.

42
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:09,299
You're not sure of his name?

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,168
You just saw him this morning.

44
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:14,370
His assistant's name is Angie. <i>Her home number is...</i>

45
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:17,130
Normal complement studies. <i>No skin leons.</i>

46
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,416
You had a manicure.

47
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:20,172
This is fresh! You weren't at the dentist.

48
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:23,010
Why would you lie about that? To avoid having this conversation.

49
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:24,845
<i>- Elevated BP. - What about pheochromocytoma?</i>

50
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,908
Or an anaphylactoid reaction, which could be triggered by certain opioids.

51
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,389
You've had your hair cut three times since I've met you.

52
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,714
You can't be embarrassed about a manicure. There's gotta be a deeper reason.

53
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,882
Did House give you homework? She's not on any meds.

54
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,611
Haven't you heard? Everybody lies.

55
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:39,763
And the tox screen was clean.

56
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:41,936
<i>Feel free to jump in at any time.</i>

57
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:47,046
We'll check catecholamines for pheo and run an expanded opioid panel.

58
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:50,565
You see what the patient says about drug use when her mother's out of the room.

59
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,392
No, never. Nobody's here to bust you, iris.

60
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:58,615
We just need to know if... No, I already told you.

61
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,923
I just take vitamin C sometimes.

62
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,492
What exactly were you doing when you had your reaction?

63
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:08,677
Opening a birthday present. The magic 8 ball.

64
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:12,756
The joke gift, not the cocaine. Is that it?

65
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:17,586
Certain drugs could explain her reaction.

66
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:24,576
What kind of drugs? What kind did you have in mind?

67
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,629
Iris has always been a moody girl.

68
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,532
And now that she's a teenager, it's gotten worse.

69
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,199
So for the past few months I've been...

70
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,077
Giving something to relax her.

71
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:39,182
Diazepam. I tell her it's vitamin c.

72
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:42,723
Being normal is very important to iris.

73
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:45,316
She couldn't handle the thought of being on meds.

74
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:48,188
Anti-anxiety medications would explain it.

75
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,880
If we keep her off,

76
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:52,503
she'll be moody, but healthy.

77
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,406
Or it's something else.

78
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,844
James Wilson.M.D.

79
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:06,554
I need to DDX a patient with you. I thought you had a team for that.

80
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:09,213
<i>According to foreman,</i> they're only for DDXing people

81
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:11,283
who are still alive.

82
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,542
You have a dead patient?

83
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:17,342
Bigotry is boring when we add modifiers.

84
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,806
I don't see creed, LOR, pulse.

85
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,512
Foreman will find out you're taking this case,
and he'll bust you.

86
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:23,909
But you know that,

87
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,640
<i>which means...</i>

88
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:29,677
You want to go back to jail...

89
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:36,024
<i>Because it's the one place</i> you're unable to iulge your self-destructive habits.

90
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:40,784
<i>Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm</i> taking this case because I miss showering with cro-magnons

91
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:43,768
than that I actually happen to find it interesting.

92
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,066
Four-year-old kid.

93
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,836
His kidneys died, they transfused.

94
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,769
His lungs died. He died.

95
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,292
<i>Have you seen bride of the monster?</i> I just got the ed wood box set.

96
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:58,723
What if the chicken was the egg?
What if the lung involvement came first?

97
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,873
I don't really care about the movie.
I just don't want to indulge your...

98
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:02,461
Lupus.

99
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,637
Because this is a bad idea, House.

100
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:09,585
If the kid had a rash or some circulation issue...

101
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,319
Damn!

102
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:16,464
I just realized I'm late for my anger management class.

103
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:24,424
<i>Traffic, for sure.</i> <i>Taxes. Definitely taxes.</i>

104
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,778
Spoiled grandchildren. Platitudes.

105
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,690
Any others? And I lose my temper when someone suggests

106
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:38,193
that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases can control our most seminal,

107
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:43,193
<i>intractable, and natural reacon</i> to a dead child.

108
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:47,175
Am I right, Emory?

109
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:54,899
I don't think Emory wants to share right now.

110
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,689
<i>They blew it, didn't they?</i> They missed your son's rash.

111
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,205
A faint one, on his cheek.

112
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,737
He didn't have a rash.

113
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,810
I think we should talk about Lena's grandchildren.
They're alive.

114
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,715
Was he sensitive to sunlight? No.

115
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:08,374
Greg... Cold fingers and toes?

116
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,478
No!

117
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,051
Wegener's granulomatosis.
I need to examine your son.

118
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,087
You're a bit late for that... You ass.

119
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:29,532
With you and your wife's consent,
we can get an exhumation order.

120
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,377
Find out what killed him.

121
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:35,315
Ex-wife.
And you'll never get her consent.

122
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,080
She's moved on... New hub, new kid.

123
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,664
She wants nothing to do with drew's death.

124
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,939
Or me.

125
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:46,713
You're angry because your kid died.

126
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:47,740
More than that,

127
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:49,877
because you don't have an answer.

128
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:53,553
People need answers.

129
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,680
He's in a crypt at St. Jude's Cemetery.

130
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:11,598
You feeling any pain or cramping here?

131
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,089
A bit.

132
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,355
But not just there, um...

133
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,337
Here. <i>Breast tenderness.</i>

134
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:22,590
Have you been having regular periods, iris?
Not really.

135
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:27,041
What is it?
I think we should run a pregnancy test.

136
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:31,467
Iris isn't sexually active. She doesn't even have a boyfriend.

137
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,238
Pregnancy would explain all of her symptoms.

138
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:35,815
Can even cause some unpredictable <i>allergic reactions.</i>

139
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,637
How can I be pregnant if I've never even had sex?

140
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:41,439
We just need a drop of blood.

141
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:46,538
What's the matter?
<i>My...</i>

142
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:48,053
My arms.

143
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:51,105
I can't feel my arms.

144
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,526
At this rate,

145
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,346
I'm gonna need to pick out a plot for myself.

146
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:05,549
Thanks to your generous donation, you have all morning.

147
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,489
More like 13 minutes.

148
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,667
Before we proceed any further, doctor,

149
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:14,188
I'd like inquire as to exactly what procedure

150
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,990
you intend to perform on the remains.

151
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:21,585
Have you ever heard of the north American man/dead boy love association?

152
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:26,157
I consider these grounds to be a holy place,

153
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:29,704
and I would ask you to observe them with due decorum.

154
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:34,046
So you're taking bribes to plunder graves, and I need to show respect.

155
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,020
I think they got the cause of death wrong.

156
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:43,066
And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose,
right about here,

157
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,739
then it means I'm right.

158
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,989
Please be respectful.

159
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,636
I prepared the sarcophagus for you.

160
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,371
Thank you, Igor.

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,989
It's Milton.

162
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,022
You owe me a new pair of pants.

163
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:59,297
<i>- She is pregnant. - Test came back positive.</i>

164
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:02,900
So... She lost the use of her arms

165
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,832
and her innocence. A vengeful God?

166
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:09,798
Or...

167
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,551
<i>Cerebral tumor.</i> <i>Vasculitis.</i>

168
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:14,018
<i>Ms.</i>

169
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,620
I gather from the silence <i>that Chase isn't there.</i>

170
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:26,112
Nope, I'm here.
Where are you?

171
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:29,427
<i>"Nowhere"...</i> <i>He said cryptically.</i>

172
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:32,102
<i>I assume you concur with the diagnosis.</i>

173
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:35,053
Absolutely.

174
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:37,595
<i>Even tugh there are three diagnoses?</i>

175
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,769
<i>And ms and vasculitis</i>
<i>usually get better with pregnancy.</i>

176
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,043
Yeah, I was saying I agreed with the other one.
He's had his eyebrows waxed.

177
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:48,785
<i>I met a woman</i>
<i>who likes her men well groomed.</i>

178
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:50,310
All over?

179
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:54,771
I assume, from the silence,

180
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:57,630
that Chase has had a brazilian.

181
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:00,611
Cool. Interesting. Ouch.

182
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:11,110
Question is... Is this really about a woman?

183
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,750
<i>Or is it about something more profound?</i>

184
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:16,085
Another question is, could the paresthesia be caused by an std?

185
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:19,051
<i>HIV-related mononeuritis multiplex.</i>

186
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:23,576
I gatherrom the silence

187
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,098
that either you all agree with Chase

188
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:29,052
or you're just staring at his emasculated brow.

189
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:34,795
In either case, test for HIV and do an MRI to rule out tumors.

190
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,101
And check Chase for testosterone.

191
00:12:57,895 --> 00:12:59,775
<i>Blood work was negative for HIV.</i>

192
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:01,629
All the money's on tumor.

193
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,611
How was the brazilian? It was fine. Hurt a bit.

194
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,724
<i>What about House's theory?</i> Why'd you really do it?

195
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:12,126
'Cause I'm vain and shallow.
And you weren't before?

196
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:15,329
<i>The girl I was seeing wasn't.</i>
There's nothing profound here.

197
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:19,210
No tumor, either. It's not her brain.

198
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,974
Everything looks good.

199
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:29,506
What's the matter?
My arm, it's...

200
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:31,884
Still nothing?
No, now they're sore.

201
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,387
Paresthesia's gone.

202
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,842
Could the bruising be caused by a physical trauma?

203
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:47,356
You think she fell out of bed, repeatedly?

204
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:49,803
A blood disorder. Maybe thrombocytopenia.

205
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:52,889
A vitamin K deficiency or scurvy could explain bleeding problems,

206
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,759
and prnancy could exacerbate it.

207
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,720
Boys, do a home search. Girls, do lab tests.

208
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,986
I'm pretty sure that's not sexist.

209
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:04,572
Where have you been?
Picking up dry cleaning.

210
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,702
Filling up the tank. Violating the dead.

211
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:10,879
If you don't believe me, call the monitoring company. <i>I did.</i>

212
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,803
Unfortunately, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station

213
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:16,527
was GPS testing and disrupted the signal,

214
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,949
at the exact, same 45 minutes you weren't here.

215
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:24,073
Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom,
I'd have gone hang gliding.

216
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:25,441
I admire the creativity.

217
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:29,365
What happens when the stunt doesn't work?
Think you're gonna have to pay off a bet?

218
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:31,766
Think I'm gonna triple your clinic hours?

219
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:34,888
I'm gonna call your P.O.,
and you're gonna go back to jail.

220
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:48,097
<i>There are mees' lines on his fingernails,</i> <i>so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning.</i>

221
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:49,218
You're an addict.

222
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:51,259
And I'm an idiot for thinking that your addictions

223
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,230
were limited to pills, anti-social behavior, and sarcasm.

224
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:56,553
Sorry.

225
00:14:56,554 --> 00:15:00,292
Vicodin repeating on me.
You're also addicted to puzzles.

226
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:02,208
You show all the classibehaviors.

227
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,608
Lying, neglecting responsibilities, and you can't stop,

228
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:07,112
no matr how devastating the consequences.

229
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:11,550
Working on a medical case is not a parole violation.
It's my job description.

230
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,103
Your job description is doing what foreman tells you to do.

231
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:18,994
<i>Never mind bride of the monster.</i> <i>You need to watch Norma rae.</i>

232
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:24,128
<i>Before we get started,</i> <i>I just want to thank you all</i> for agreeing to relocate.

233
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:28,054
Um, I had an appointment in this part of town,
and I absolutely didn't want to miss this meeting.

234
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:29,880
<i>But, uh, thank you.</i>

235
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:31,310
I'm buying.

236
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:33,096
Not literally.

237
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,554
Hey, Emory, should we, uh, powder our noses?

238
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:46,475
Hey, did you know your ex-wife still lives right behind this place?

239
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:51,681
She finishes work at 4:00.

240
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,646
Picks up her new kid at 4:15.

241
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,666
Gives us about 20 minutes.

242
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:58,678
I made some calls.

243
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,120
It's amazing what people will tell you if you ask brutally enough.

244
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:05,008
Was that table here?

245
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:13,388
Some kinds of pressure-treated wood can contain arsenic.

246
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:17,738
We shouldn't be here. We don't have a choice.

247
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:21,209
This is the only way you're gonna get your answer.

248
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:24,068
<i>Does your ex leave a spare key anywhere?</i>

249
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,823
How did he look?

250
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,360
Peaceful.

251
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,233
Vitamin k deficiency's a bust. Fridge has more spinach and broccoli than a farmer's market.

252
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,783
The brazilian...

253
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,076
You said it hurt "a bit."

254
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,614
You've had one? More than one, and you haven't.

255
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:56,840
They hurt all your bits. That's my dark secret.

256
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,554
What's yours?

257
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:02,425
I had the nails and eyebrows done, but that's it.

258
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:07,191
I just needed to create a distraction, though.
I met a TV producer at a dinner.

259
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,820
She asked me to appear on the medical segment.

260
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,838
Screen tested it yesterday and shot it today.

261
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,460
You're a TV doctor?

262
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:18,041
It's a one-off. <i>When's it air?</i>

263
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:22,025
Two hours ago. Otherwise, I'd still be lying.

264
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:23,881
This is what she was opening

265
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,973
when she had her attack.

266
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,661
Will anyone believe Chase is an actual doctor?

267
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,543
"Don't count on it."

268
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,732
She does have a boyfriend. Love letters.

269
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:53,039
<i>Porn. The nasty kind.</i>

270
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,360
Torture, rape... Animals.

271
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,040
Sweet kid.

272
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,477
This is all that's left.

273
00:19:57,492 --> 00:20:00,298
One box in the bottom of a closet.

274
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:18,159
He used to wear those stupid things all the time.

275
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,877
Used to have to pretend I was scared.

276
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,667
Made in the people's Republic of Lead Paint.

277
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:28,414
Back door.

278
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:33,076
Let's get out of here first. We need to catch the end of our class.

279
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,510
I met him at school.

280
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,853
He was the only boy that liked me.

281
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,743
It's a little more than like.

282
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,019
We haven't had sex.

283
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,760
Oh, come on, iris. You're pregnant.

284
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:56,118
So I'm just lying about everything? <i>Well, you lied about the boyfriend.</i>

285
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,175
You obviously lied about sex

286
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:02,492
and this... Garbage.
They're his.

287
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:07,081
He can't keep them at his place.
Well, I'm glad we could be so accommodating.

288
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:09,106
What else don't I know?

289
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,982
Honey...

290
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:21,869
What is it?

291
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:26,920
He came here last night.

292
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,124
<i>And he told me I should leave.</i>

293
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,838
But I didn't want to, and he got mad.

294
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:39,536
He hit you? Physical trauma.?????

295
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:43,659
We should call the police.
I won't tell them anything.

296
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,694
That's ridiculous. <i>He beat you!</i>

297
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:55,303
What is it? It's getting hard to see.

298
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:57,529
What the hell is happening to me?

299
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:06,831
Rubbing alcohol, vinegar.

300
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:12,344
Not sure what this is. Aren't there actual medical tests?

301
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:15,370
Dead patients usually get a lower standard of care.

302
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:16,966
Pink means lead.

303
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,464
Orange means Mercury.

304
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:21,919
And rust means arsenic.

305
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,203
<i>And what's brown mean?</i> Scotch.

306
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:05,108
He used to call him "deezer."

307
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:08,789
<i>He couldn't say "zebra."</i>

308
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:11,398
He'd have his own words for everything.

309
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:13,533
We called 'em "drewisms."

310
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,127
How does your ex-wife do it?

311
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:25,458
How come she's not... Angry and miserable?

312
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,683
She treated it like it never happened.

313
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,395
She never even cried.

314
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:37,317
Not even at his funeral.

315
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,410
I was a mess,

316
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:42,178
and she just sat there like...

317
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:45,991
A statue.

318
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:55,882
We have a problem. Does it limp?

319
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:03,154
Why do you care if he works on two cases?

320
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:05,865
'Cause next, it'll be three cases, then four.

321
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:08,043
Then animal cases and ghost cases.

322
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:12,039
Then animal ghost cases. Assuming, of course, we are talking about House.

323
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,377
You're just setting yourself up to fail.

324
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:17,281
He has a lot more to lose than I do, and he knows that.

325
00:24:17,282 --> 00:24:19,888
He's rational.
No, he's not.

326
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:22,999
He's the most rational man I've ever met. Annoyingly so.

327
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,740
He isn't gonna put himself back in jail over a dead kid.

328
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:30,065
He's an addict, and he will put himself back in jail over a puzzle.

329
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,100
He'll back down.

330
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:41,583
Halfway through the perimetry exam, her tunnel vision went away.

331
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:43,766
<i>She can see perfectly. TIA.</i>

332
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:46,002
The word "transient" is right there in the name.

333
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,314
Ah, here we go.

334
00:24:55,085 --> 00:24:57,978
Chesa, after giving the pics an eye or two,

335
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:01,543
I can confirm that Lauren's surgeries cost her some big bikkies.

336
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:05,108
<i>Not only was there a gut tuck,</i> <i>nose tuck, and arse tuck,</i>

337
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,608
but her new, fake norks stick out like nuts on a mutt.

338
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,998
The original script was...
<i>Shh, shh, shh. Anyone notice...</i>

339
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:14,489
He's enlightening us.

340
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,456
<i>That's 'cause he's retooled the ol' todger.</i>

341
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:19,695
Let's just hope no one cut the wrong wire, eh?

342
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:26,489
So you just wanted to look pretty on TV.

343
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,092
Question is, why did he want that?
Clinic time.

344
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,229
What do you want us to do?

345
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:36,050
MRA 4 TIA. ROFL.

346
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,410
Thought you only had clinic on Tuesdays.
Oh, you're right.

347
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,562
Hi. I'm here for the free flu shot.
I got a call saying...

348
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:50,159
I'm here to find out why you didn't care about your first kid.

349
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,439
Losing a child... Just breezed right through it.

350
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:55,513
How do you know about my first kid...

351
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:58,196
Didn't even squeeze out a single tear at the funeral.
Where are you getting this?

352
00:25:58,197 --> 00:26:01,012
You couldn't wait to squeeze out a brand-new replacement kid.

353
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:05,633
Damn it.

354
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:09,296
You had no right to say that.
I know. I deserved the slap.

355
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:13,805
But I was hoping that you weren't capable of it.
Apathetic hyperthyroidism.

356
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,611
Could have kidney involvement. Could be genetic.

357
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:18,315
Definitely causes apathy.

358
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:20,636
I was hoping that your lack of emotion

359
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:24,405
was a symptom of something you could have passed on to your first son.

360
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,706
You know Emory. We belong to the same club.

361
00:26:30,707 --> 00:26:33,521
He wants to relive this. I don't.

362
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:34,993
So I heard.

363
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,936
Emory was a wonderful man.

364
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,166
Never afraid to show his emotions.

365
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:50,370
Which is great, most of the time.
But when drew died...

366
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,553
It overwhelmed him.

367
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:56,148
I vowed I wouldn't let that happen to me.

368
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,305
That's why you left him? <i>I left because of his eyes.</i>

369
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,828
He had drew's eyes.

370
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:09,910
Who used to babysit drew?

371
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,090
My father, but...
His place or yours?

372
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:16,947
There are two types of people.

373
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:19,069
<i>Those who can move on, and those who can't.</i>

374
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,741
<i>My father keeps up a good front,</i> <i>but he's just like Emory.</i>

375
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,381
<i>You need to leave him alone.</i>

376
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:27,602
So he has two types of people inside of him.

377
00:27:38,478 --> 00:27:40,735
Mra was normal.
Yeah, how did...

378
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:43,097
I found out where your boyfriend lives.

379
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:45,517
When I paid him a visit, he took off.

380
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:48,898
Ran in front of a car.
You're lying.

381
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:52,167
He's down in the E.R. right now.
Shut up, you lying sack of crap.

382
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:53,622
Iris!

383
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,823
How do you know I'm lying?

384
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:57,820
<i>How do you know your boyfriend's okay?</i>

385
00:27:57,821 --> 00:28:00,291
'Cause I'm right here, you dick.

386
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:09,423
Iris has dissociative identity disorder.

387
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:12,534
Also known as multiple personality disorder.

388
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:17,158
Are you saying I'm crazy?
It's the mind's response to a severe trauma.

389
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,810
A person experiences something <i>that's too difficult to accept,</i>

390
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:23,022
so they create alternate personalities that don't have to accept it.

391
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:25,072
Some think it's quite a natural reaction.

392
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:27,695
Iris hasn't had any severe traumas.

393
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:30,588
The car accident?
I was two.

394
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,614
I don't remember anything.

395
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:35,869
These personalities that I'm supposed to have...

396
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:39,272
Where are they?
They only come out when you're afraid or anxious.

397
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:41,684
That's why House used the hurt boyfriend story.

398
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:44,888
<i>But if there's no boyfriend,</i> <i>where did the bruises come from?</i>

399
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,460
The pregnancy?

400
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,066
When you say your boyfriend hit you,

401
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:52,333
<i>it means you actually hit yourself.</i>

402
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,935
<i>And the pregnancy...</i>

403
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:58,353
<i>Doesn't take a boyfriend.</i>
<i>Just a boy.</i>

404
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,283
<i>You may not be aware</i> of half the things you've done.

405
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,764
How could this be happening

406
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:14,321
<i>to my own daughter without me knowing it?</i>
Diazepam was masking it.

407
00:29:14,322 --> 00:29:16,451
Taking her off made it more apparent.

408
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:19,540
But I... I wasn't on... "Diazepam"?

409
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:20,990
What is that?

410
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,821
That's what those vitamin pills were.

411
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,080
<i>Iris... I am so sorry.</i>

412
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:37,175
<i>I just... I thought you were moody.</i>

413
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:40,040
<i>I didn't want you to think you needed medication.</i>

414
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:48,096
Oh, my God. I n't believe how stupid I've been.

415
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,567
We need you to help us with something.

416
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,852
Different alters can he different apparent symptoms.

417
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:58,137
<i>Allergies, paresthesia, vision loss,</i>

418
00:29:58,138 --> 00:30:00,917
changes in blood pressure. Do you think I'm making this up?

419
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:03,937
Your symptoms are real. But some are physiological,

420
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:07,413
and others are psychological.
So there's something wrong with her...

421
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:10,060
In addition to the multiple personalities?

422
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,546
Yes, but we won't know what

423
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:15,054
until we access her alters and compare their symptoms.

424
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:16,985
Well, how do you do that?

425
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:18,803
Hypnosis.

426
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:23,116
Foreman's nogonna back down.

427
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,273
He's not an idiot. Yes, he is.

428
00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:28,763
Just like you. If you keep being stubborn,

429
00:30:28,764 --> 00:30:32,124
he will keep being stubborn. Eventually, you will screw something up.

430
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,044
Which will be bad news for both of you.

431
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:38,214
But... Only one of you will be in prison.

432
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,745
It just isn't worth it, House.

433
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,519
Okay.

434
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:47,729
Uh, y-yes, sir.

435
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,625
I... yes, I know I told you that I had a chiropractor's appointment,

436
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:53,755
but, uh, I got a flat.

437
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:56,274
I know, right?

438
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,807
So...

439
00:31:58,102 --> 00:32:00,283
You know, don't send out the marines.

440
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:04,903
I should be back on the road in a few minutes.
Okaybye.

441
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:12,310
Dr. James Wilson, county coroner.

442
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:15,576
I'd like to ask you about your grandson, drew lemaine.

443
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:35,483
What did he do when he was here? Where did he play? What did he eat?

444
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:38,194
We watched lot of TV.

445
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:40,124
And ate biscuits.

446
00:32:41,112 --> 00:32:43,570
<i>Did you give him sidewalk chalk? No.</i>

447
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:45,510
Finger paints? No!

448
00:32:46,418 --> 00:32:49,054
A sandbox? It's like I said.

449
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:51,357
We watched a lotta TV.

450
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,095
You expecting someone?
What?

451
00:33:04,203 --> 00:33:08,830
Dr. Wilson my ass!
I told you to leave him alone, you son of a bitch!

452
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:10,807
Temper trigger.

453
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,782
<i>Who am I talking to now?</i>

454
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,686
<i>Nobody.</i>

455
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:21,886
<i>You must be somebody.</i>

456
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,204
I'm too little.

457
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,381
Nobody sees me.

458
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,943
Nobody knows I'm here.

459
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:32,949
<i>BP just went to 140 over 90.</i>

460
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:38,018
What is it? My arms.

461
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:39,888
You can't feel them?

462
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,786
It's okay. We can fix that.

463
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:48,279
Do you hurt anywhere else?
Not right now.

464
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:50,826
<i>But you used to hurt?</i>

465
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:54,018
When I ate strawberries.

466
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:59,127
And when I remember...

467
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,703
<i>Do you remember being hurt?</i>

468
00:34:04,065 --> 00:34:06,168
I remember everything.

469
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:24,190
<i>Baby...</i>

470
00:34:27,006 --> 00:34:29,393
It's going to be okay, baby.

471
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:57,886
Iris? Why didn't you ever tell me?

472
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,194
It was my fault daddy died.

473
00:35:02,195 --> 00:35:05,372
Oh, no. No. Yes, it was.

474
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:08,498
I was crying and he couldn't drive. It was my fault daddy's...

475
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:10,888
Oh, no. No, no, honey.

476
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:12,033
Yes. You were just a baby.

477
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:14,891
It wasn't your fault. No, shh.

478
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,509
Oh, baby.
It was my fault.

479
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,225
I'm sorry, mommy.

480
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:22,538
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

481
00:35:34,535 --> 00:35:37,681
<i>It wasn't a miscarriage.</i> Test shows she's still pregnant.

482
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:42,819
<i>Okay, cross out everything</i> <i>that doesn't appear in every alter.</i>

483
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,866
When she opened the magic 8 ball, that triggered a switch to a personality <i>with a strawberry allergy.

484
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:52,415
</i> Pregnancy, vaginal bleeding, and elevated b.P. Could be pre-eclampsia.

485
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,770
Worst case, could be an ectopic pregnancy.
We need to ultrasound.

486
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,460
Not seeing an embryo in the fallopian tube.

487
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:09,912
I'm not seeing an embryo anywhere.

488
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:15,548
Which idiot did the egnancy test?
I did one of them. Chase did another.

489
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:18,044
Taub did a third. Three tests, three positives.

490
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:21,656
What happened to your eye?
I grabbed park's ass.

491
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,206
Exoplanets.

492
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,575
I think he said exoplanets. Wait for it...

493
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,941
We can't actually see them...

494
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,161
But we infer their existence because of the effect they have on the star they orbit.

495
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,680
Pregnancy test only infers an embryo's existence

496
00:36:36,681 --> 00:36:39,109
because of elevated hcg levels.

497
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:42,801
Which could also be caused by choriocarcinoma, which affects the placenta,

498
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:45,820
<i>mimics pregnancy,</i> <i>and causes elevated BP and vaginal bleeding.</i>

499
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:49,813
Occult choriocarcinoma, which is why we didn't see it on the ultrasound

500
00:36:49,814 --> 00:36:52,648
tell all the alters that they have cancer.

501
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:06,767
<i>Mom or dad?</i>

502
00:37:07,306 --> 00:37:10,389
Mom, dad, and mom's dad.

503
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:12,201
The good news is,

504
00:37:12,202 --> 00:37:16,660
made me realize that you were right.
I can't drop it.

505
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:22,142
But now that I accept that, I feel much less conflicted.

506
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:25,130
I've ruled out wegener's, Berger's, heavy metal poison...

507
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:28,734
Two trains are about to collide,
and I'm trying to talk them out of it.

508
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:30,496
Feels like I'm missing something.
<i>No, no.</i>

509
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:33,087
You don't want to listen to me,
then I don't want to listen to you.

510
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,634
<i>That is so fifth grade. I agree.</i> And you know why?

511
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:40,183
Because I'm just as bad as you. I knew ts would fall on deaf ears,

512
00:37:40,184 --> 00:37:42,658
but I just kept talking and talking.

513
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:45,802
You're right.

514
00:37:46,636 --> 00:37:48,636
You don't even know what I just said.

515
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:51,090
That is ridiculous.

516
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:54,512
You said, "blah blah blah blah blah, deaf ears, blah blah blah blah blah."

517
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:56,771
Absolutely essential information.

518
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,533
Ray...

519
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,629
Ray!

520
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:18,024
Leave him alone.
What are you doing to him?

521
00:38:18,223 --> 00:38:20,398
It's okay.
<i>Mickey...</i>

522
00:38:21,028 --> 00:38:24,762
You? You brought him. I asked him to meet me here for a family reunion.

523
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:26,244
Ray!

524
00:38:26,443 --> 00:38:29,055
Let's just get out of here, okay?
I know what killed your son.

525
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,112
You don't get it, do you?
I don't care what killed him!

526
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:33,676
It's called alport syndrome.
It's a genetic condition
characterized by kidney failure,

527
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:38,638
?????bronchial myomas, mees' lines,
and deafness.

528
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,646
Idiot. Drew wasn't deaf!

529
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:42,766
<i>House... Son of a bitch!</i>
Get away from them!

530
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,671
House, House!
It's a genetic condition!

531
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:47,736
Shut up! Genetic!

532
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:54,427
Your father has the gene. So do you.

533
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:58,893
It's grandpa's slight deafness that gave the game away.

534
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:00,529
You're apparently asymptomatic.

535
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,013
You could still pass the gene onto your children.

536
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,757
Plural.

537
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:11,963
You're lying.

538
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,199
He has high-frequency hearing impairment.

539
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,682
And so did drew.

540
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,851
That's why drew made up his own words.

541
00:39:22,852 --> 00:39:24,661
'Cause he couldn't hear properly.

542
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:31,632
It's okay. Now that we know what it is,

543
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,904
he'll need treatment, but he'll live.

544
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:42,334
You know, there are platitudes that can help you with that.

545
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,495
I miss him too.

546
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:53,938
She's responding well.

547
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,792
Cuddy threatened him with clinic duty.

548
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:15,519
I thought threatening him with jail would be different.

549
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,953
Not an irrational thought.

550
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:20,983
I'm still sending him back.

551
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:24,140
He saved two lives.

552
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:26,654
Which means it's too late for me to back down.

553
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:27,743
<i>It's no longer my choice.</i>

554
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:30,975
It's just me telling him he can get away with anything.

555
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:35,353
I have to send him to prison.

556
00:41:43,175 --> 00:41:47,064
Your job is to keep this machine running.

557
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:51,658
It's your choice to make House a useful tool or a monkey wrench.

558
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,555
Cuddy's way didn't fail because she didn't try to control House.

559
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,549
She managed him.

560
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:03,995
She knew better than anybody what a tool he could be.

561
00:42:36,578 --> 00:42:38,430
What would Cuddy have done?

562
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:44,123
Ten clinic hours.

563
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:50,704
Cuddy's not here anymore.

564
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,037
You got 30.

565
00:42:52,038 --> 00:43:02,000
