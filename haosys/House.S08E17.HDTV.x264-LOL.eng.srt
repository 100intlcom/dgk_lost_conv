1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,740
<i>Keep breathing.</i> <i>Nice and slow.</i>

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,780
Now, the first couple of shots will show you if the sights are off

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,240
or the barrel's bent. Let me make this real easy for you.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,560
The sights are off and the barrel's bent.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,040
Mm, you're off to the left about an inch.

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,260
That's it. Shoot around the star.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,530
Not at it.

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,190
Yes! Yeah! You did it!

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>I didn't.</i>

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,170
You just won your girlfriend a Teddy bear.

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,370
Cool. Hey, which one you think she'd like best?

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,720
And then Thursday night, this physicist

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,710
is giving a lecture in Brooklyn.

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,920
It's about time travel and the grandfather paradox.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,870
I don't know if you're busy...

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,520
Okay, Henry. Henry... Um...

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,130
Can we talk for a second?
Yeah.

18
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,170
I'm really happy that we've been hanging out so much.

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,270
Yeah, I- I like you too. Heh.

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,200
Can you put down the bear?

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,920
Henry...

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,650
What?

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,240
I can't.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,700
I know.

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,460
You have a girlfriend.
It's just...

26
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,990
She never seems...

27
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,240
to want to do anything with you.

28
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,570
Are you crying? No, I have allergies.

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,140
I must just be, like, tearing up.

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,810
Henry, I think that's blood.

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,190
What? I-it...

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,920

35
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,490
35-year-old male cries blood, and he's not vampire Bill.

36
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,280
Go! Should we ask?

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,290
Nope! What, her?

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,810
<i>Yeah, my favorite</i> companion is retiring from "companning. "

39
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,090
So I'm interviewing replacements.

40
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,340
<i>Thank you...</i>

41
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,490
Butterscotch. Is that a family name?

42
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,250
How long are you gonna be using the office for sex games?

43
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,160
Just so I can plan my day.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,290
Sex and work?
I'm not a savage.

45
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,040
I asked for a cappuccino.
That's what this is.

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,240
No, a cappuccino's got a nice, stiff foam on it.
<i>This is wetter than...</i>

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,740
Oh... almost slipped there.

48
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,450
<i>Well, thank you,</i> Ms. Scotch,

49
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,510
but poor foaming's a deal breaker.

50
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,710
Could you ask the next candidate to come in?

51
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,980
Initial exam showed no sign of trauma <i>or subconjunctival hemorrhage.</i>

52
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,360
<i>Lymphocytosis?</i>

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,340
ALC's in normal range, <i>but it's in the high end of normal.</i>

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,180
Take a seat, Fawn.

55
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,370
And tell me, what's your favorite Woody Allen movie?

56
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,290
<i>Annie Hall.</i>

57
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,910
You're interviewing hookers but not gonna talk to them about sex?

58
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,280
Sex is a given. They're hookers.

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,150
Defend your choice.

60
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,030
It's the most popular.
Ohh... that's so close.

61
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,250
We would have accepted, "Diane Keaton looks great in suits," or,

62
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,150
 "it's a trenchant commentary on today's mores," or, "I needed the eggs. "

63
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,970
Thanks for your interest.

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,120
To get the gig, call girl- <i>sorry, call woman-</i>

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,890
needs a combination of skills that I find useful/entertaining

66
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,130
for the remaining 57 minutes of the hour I paid for.

67
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,070
Lymphocytosis works.
Maybe we should take another look at the blood.

68
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,640
Could also be cavernous sinus thrombosis.

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,540
Clot builds up pressure at the base of the brain.

70
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,890
Rerun the patient's blood panel and get a CT venogram of his head.

71
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,410
Let's see which one of you is right.

72
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,360
How are you with small appliance repair?

73
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,680
Uh, this cavernous sinus thing, is it dangerous?

74
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,980
If Henry's got it, <i>we can treat it with a combo</i> of drugs and surgery.

75
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,490
Success rate is over 70%.

76
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,940
Do you want me to call Amy again?
No, it's fine.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,940
Amy's his girlfriend.
I'm the neighbor.

78
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,660
<i>I did leave a message at their number.</i>
<i>Do you wanna try her cell?</i>

79
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,810
Be here for a few more hours at least.

80
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,740
Oh, she doesn't have one. She worries about radiation.
<i>I could stop by on my way home.</i>

81
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,700
She knows who I am, right?
<i>You don't need to, but thanks.</i>

82
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,420
Good luck.
Okay.

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,100
<i>Have you ever paid for sex?</i>

84
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,770
Every guy who's ever seen a Merchant Ivory movie has paid for sex.

85
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,050
No. It just...

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,950
seems too demeaning to women.

87
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,050
Given the things you've done to women, that seems arbitrary.

88
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,000
You're Chi Park, right?

89
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,840
Who's asking? Uh, you called about my guitar flyer.

90
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,760
You're Micah. This guy's selling

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,140
a 1974 Gibson SG standard in tobacco for $1,250.

92
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,690
<i>Yeah, actually, I came in to tell you</i> I already sold it.

93
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,470
Sorry.

94
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,040
Thanks anyway.

95
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,200
Blood panel results seem pretty much the same as before, and that guy likes you.

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,750
Maybe we should check for diabetes. Could weaken conjunctival vessels.

97
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,630
And shut up. If I'm wrong, then why is he coming back?

98
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,960
My band is rehearsing tomorrow night.

99
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,780
You should come by and jam with us.

100
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,850
That... sounds fun.

101
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,340
I'll think about it.
Great. Call me.

102
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,120
Park has a boyfriend.

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,100
I'll break your face.

104
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,600
This is the talent portion of the interview.
<i>Okay.</i>

105
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,150
You like cards.

106
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,850
<i>But you can juggle.</i>

107
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,990
I fail to see how this would be of benefit to you.

108
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,240
What if I'm busy? Have you got anything else?

109
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,050
Sure.

110
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,270
CT showed no clots or malformations.

111
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,040
Park and Taub ruled out lymphocytosis and diabetes.

112
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,670
Well, since you have nothing of relevance to report, 

113
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,480
I assume that you're here to toss your panties in the ring.

114
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,360
<i>Patient's got a mysterious girlfriend</i> <i>he really wants to see.</i>

115
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,330
She's unreachable by phone, <i>and the neighbor's never even seen her.</i>

116
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,620
What do you think?

117
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,090
He's gay.

118
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,030
I think he's a junkie. The girlfriend is a fix.

119
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,250
<i>The guy's inhaling glue.</i> Can you repair a blender?

120
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,260
Can you bite me? Go search the patient's home.

121
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,250
Well, thank you, ladies.

122
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,820
I've seen a lot of very talented candidates.

123
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,290
Got a tough decision the next few days.

124
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,000
This is the part I hate.

125
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,620
Well... this is not exactly a crack den.

126
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,530
Doesn't exactly look like a woman lives here, either.

127
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,480
"To Amy.
I love you. "

128
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Okay. She exists.

129
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,280
Doesn't mean he's not a drug addict.

130
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,120
It's good you're playing it cool with House.
<i>Once he gets a rise out of someone...</i>

131
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,380
Yeah, I'm not crazy about the whole hooker thing, but I get it.

132
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,530
Other than the fact that it's exploitative and dangerous for women,

133
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,950
you get what you need without any of the emotional baggage.

134
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,730
You're not seeing anyone, I take it.
I've been volunteering at the Trenton Free Clinic.

135
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,950
Keeps me busy.

136
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,190
You volunteer every night and every weekend?

137
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,440
No time to grab dinner?
What's more important-

138
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,030
making small talk over ravioli <i>or helping people who are less fortunate?</i>

139
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,600
With that rationale, none of us should ever eat again.

140
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,020
Let's just say I'm not hungry right now.

141
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,960
Oh, God...

142
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,670
I don't think she's breathing. Do you think she OD'd?

143
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,220
That or he killed her.
Pulse?

144
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,830
No.
I'll call the coroner.

145
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,180
I don't think that's gonna be necessary.

146
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,300
This one works in financial district.
She can get tips, give you leg up in market.

147
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,710
What is "fudgey Gonzalez"?

148
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,190
Uh, imagine a "vanilla Gonzalez,"

149
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,000
but from the other side.

150
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,340
I'm about to make a decision, but there's still time for you to sneak under the wire.

151
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,550
My favorite Woody Allen movie <i>is Melinda and Melinda.</i>

152
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,870
<i>Our patient is not a junkie,</i>

153
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,310
but he does have a girlfriend.

154
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,790
I call her my "girlfriend" because people understand that.

155
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,400
If I explained it, they'd just think I was a weirdo.

156
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,990
We're not here to judge anyone's fetish. I'm not a pervert.

157
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,230
It's not like I'm more attracted to dolls than humans.

158
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,020
So you don't have sex with her?

159
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,890
It's not just about that.

160
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,350
Does the doll talk to you?

161
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,520
I know she's not a real person.

162
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,160
In a lot of ways, she's better than a person.

163
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,780
<i>I can tell her things, and she won't</i> argue with me or make fun of me.

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,660
I come home every night, and I know she'll be there waiting.

165
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,440
So is your toaster.

166
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,530
No one in the world has an emotional attachment to a toaster.

167
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,310
But a lot of people are willing to spend $7,000 <i>on women like Amy.</i>

168
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,330
Have you ever tried an actual-
<i>Yeah, I'm 35.</i>

169
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,600
I've been in relationships. Just none of them fulfilled me.

170
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,960
And one day, I saw this website,

171
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,820
and... maybe the perfect woman's out there somewhere,

172
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,340
but it's not worth going through

173
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,240
<i>what it would take to find her.</i>

174
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,120
Amy makes me happy.

175
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,880
<i>You're swelling.</i> It's sort of hot in here.

176
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,190
Not that hot.

177
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,270
Bleeding plus two more symptoms: Fever and neurological.

178
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,770
I'm not sure about that last one.

179
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,460
I think he's just... weird. He wasn't hallucinating.

180
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,930
He didn't have a thought disorder.
And you don't think it's "disordered" to talk to-

181
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,390
It's not all that different from talking to your cat or a Teddy bear.

182
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,350
You don't have sex with your cat or Teddy bear.

183
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,990
If you did, you'd probably talk to them more.

184
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,620
Guy loves an imaginary being who's never going to respond to him.

185
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,670
He's no crazier than millions of churchgoers.

186
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,360
You think anything off about any patient is a symptom.

187
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,860
This guy buys flowers.

188
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,850
<i>Real flowers for a piece of plastic in a dress.</i>

189
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,030
You know what's really crazy?

190
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,430
Living with a human being.

191
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,970
Someone with opinions and feelings.

192
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,030
Gets mad just 'cause you want to take Salsa classes with them one night a week.

193
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,160
One night. He's just running away.

194
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,050
He hangs out with a doll, he never needs to fear rejection.

195
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,540
It's sad. You do understand the irony here?

196
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,980
Every person in this room has a sex doll.

197
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,290
<i>At least the patient has the stones</i> to be honest about it.

198
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,240
Ooh, a metaphor.

199
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,240
What you didn't foresee is that is that I actually do have a sex doll.

200
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,720
Your doll is your kids.

201
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,000
Yours is your parents, <i>yours is your charity.</i>

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,460
All excuses for not being in a relationship. He's not wrong.

203
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,250
And you- I have meaningless sex with random strangers.

204
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,430
Thanks for the insight, but I stopped that months ago.

205
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,290
I actually had a relationship.
With a patient.

206
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,250
You just date whoever happens to cross your path.

207
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,310
My dating is getting in the way of my dating?
<i>You don't go looking for the right person.</i>

208
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,050
You just shack up with whoever's in the room, and then you get surprised and/or divorced

209
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,840
when it doesn't work out. I'm surprised you haven't asked Adams out yet.

210
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,900
Uh, for your information, I've got a date tonight.

211
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,770
I'll be jamming with a cute guy and his band.

212
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,890
<i>- You'll bail. - He's right.</i>

213
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,600
<i>The obvious solution is for me to</i> hand my kids over to your parents.

214
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,390
Can we stop trying to argue the premise

215
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,690
and move onto figuring out why it is that you're all social morons?

216
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,750
You do understand the irony here.

217
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,380
You mocking us for avoiding relationships,

218
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,540
but you can't handle losing your "doll. "

219
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,100
<i>Your spending all this time and energy</i> interviewing for a new one.

220
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,820
You're right. That is stupid.

221
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,200
What about the patient?

222
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,510
Dude's banging a sex doll.

223
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,220
<i>A festering cesspool of bodily fluids and associated bacteria.</i>

224
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,190
Swab her out and find out which one.

225
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,240
I need you. Please don't quit.

226
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,890
You're the only hooker I know who can tune a piano.

227
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,690
If it's about the money,

228
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,020
then I can up you to three nights a week.

229
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,810
I'm getting married, House.

230
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,270
His name's Harris.

231
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,220
He's a certified accountant, he's loves schlocky horror movies,

232
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,960
and he just moved in.
We're very happy.

233
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,520
Well, you're happy? Yeah, you're happy because he doesn't know

234
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,210
about your employment history. He knows.

235
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,130
We've talked about it, and he accepts me for who I am.

236
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,440
No. He...

237
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,300
If he accepted who you were, he would not be making you give up your career.

238
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,990
Women need their own identities, their own livelihoods.

239
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,400
Otherwise, why was I smoking all those Virginia Slims?

240
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,790
I know this is weird for you,

241
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,730
but you need to figure out a way to be okay with it.

242
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,580
I'll miss you, too.

243
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,810
I feel like the stirrups are overkill.

244
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,400
I've never done a pelvic on a doll before.

245
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,780
I'm unfamiliar with the protocol.

246
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,440
I'm pretty skeeved out right now.

247
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,200
I'm not gonna lie. What House said back there-

248
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,280
House says a lot of things. I don't just date whoever shows up.

249
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,720
I mean, I did meet women in the hospital,

250
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,210
but they weren't just flings.

251
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,740
Basically, you're explaining why you're not going to ask me out.

252
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,510
That's not what I was-

253
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,860
did you want me to ask you out? Yeah.

254
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,920
I told Park to tell Taub to tell House to pass you that note.

255
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,570
It's completely clean in there.

256
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,540
He said he just bathed her.

257
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,120
Adams...

258
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,450
there's a swelling beneath the skin...

259
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,670
3- inch mass.

260
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,040
Is it...

261
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,950
Part of the doll's skeleton? It feels like a tumor.

262
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,800
SIEMENS

263
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,290
CT showed an air-filled mass in the doll's abdomen.

264
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,080
It's probably just a chemical reaction.

265
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,780
Henry left her too close to a heating pipe or something.

266
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,790
This guy brushes her hair every morning, brings home movies for them to watch together.

267
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,580
You think he tosses her in a broom closet at the end of each day?

268
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,980
<i>More likely than it getting stomach cancer.</i>

269
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,740
How about clostridium?

270
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,260
Bacteria got trapped in the airtight cavity, produced gas...

271
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,230
It doesn't explain the neurological issue.

272
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,220
We can explain that the same way
we explain the tooth fairy.

273
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,220
Oh, I get to play Solomon.
Cut the doll open.

274
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,970
We can't just destroy the patient's property.
That thing cost 7 grand.

275
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,280
Exactly. Ask him for consent.

276
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,640
<i>If he says yes,</i> then we get to go hunting bacteria.

277
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,320
<i>If he says no, there's no need because he's crazy,</i> and we need a different theory.

278
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,590
See ya. Gotta go build a temple.

279
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,710
Okay.

280
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,040
You sure?
It won't be able to heal when we're done.

281
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,030
But you think she could tell you what's wrong with me.

282
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,450
<i>Yes.</i>

283
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,300
Okay.

284
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,180
Should we take her to the procedure room?
It's not a her, which means we can do this anywhere.

285
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,990
<i>Adams...</i>

286
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,340
You can know something's not real and still love it.

287
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,720
I think the procedure room might be better for this.

288
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,140
You are a horrible person.

289
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,300
All I need is to break up one marriage.

290
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,880
You've broken up three of your own.

291
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,850
You're like the Stephen Hawking of killing relationships.

292
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,910
Actually, no, Stephen Hawking <i>is the Stephen Hawking of-</i>

293
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,570
Okay. I have work to do. <i>Your computer is off.</i>

294
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,720
Sorry, I can't hear you over my "stereo. "

295
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,570
<i>Why do you assume that marriage</i> is better than hooking?

296
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,730
We don't know anything about the guy. He could be a serial killer.

297
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,410
Even if that were true, it would still be a toss-up.

298
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,310
What kind of guy marries a hooker?
Somebody who hires hookers.

299
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,100
And someone who hires hookers is not exactly the monogamous type.

300
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,290
If we expose him as a cheater... You're a coward.

301
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,130
Would a coward fight to the end to save a damsel in soon-to-be-proved distress?

302
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,460
Absolutely, if what he's afraid of is other damsels.

303
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,130
Your last relationship failed so miserably, you ended up in jail.

304
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,980
Now you're clinging to this hooker

305
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,070
when there are about 3 billion other women out there who aren't call girls,

306
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,020
some of whom are attractive and intelligent,

307
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,280
one of whom is living in your apartment and is married to you!

308
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,760
You're right.

309
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,990
Why am I asking you for help?

310
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,870
You shouldn't sleep with Chase.

311
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,050
Thank, God. You got here just in time.

312
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,520
What do you have against him?

313
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,950
Nothing, but House has a way <i>of getting into people's heads.</i>

314
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,680
Just like last week when he was prying into your relationship with Chase?

315
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,130
It was silly then, and it's silly now.

316
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,220
Why was it silly then?

317
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,640
I'm not 5'9" with curves and flowing hair,

318
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,270
so it's impossible for me to get it on with a good-looking guy?

319
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,380
Wow. Do you resent me?

320
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,690
<i>You're the quirky, hardworking sophomore</i>

321
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,570
and I'm the evil cheerleader who steals boys?

322
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,250
If you're not getting any, it's not my fault.

323
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,390
Should we get the one with the panda on it or the bird?

324
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,300
Good choice.

325
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,760
Pandas eat only bamboo,

326
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,390
<i>they know nothing about cereal.</i>

327
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,290
Your little girl is adorable.

328
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,690
Thanks. She keeps me very busy.

329
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,430
You and her mom must be very proud.

330
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,490
Her mother... Died in childbirth.

331
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,130
*You ask me if there'll come a time *

332
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,510
*when I grow tired of you *

333
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,570
*never my love *

334
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:59,690
*never my love never my love *

335
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,550
*how can you think love will end *

336
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,680
*when I've asked you to spend *

337
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,980
*your whole life *

338
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,650
Amy. How'd it go?

339
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,450
We're growing cultures now,

340
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,070
but she looked clean, and there was no telltale smell.

341
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,650
I'm guessing the lump was just an air bubble that got trapped in the mold.

342
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,170
You bandaged her up. I threw in some stitches, too.

343
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,770
Just wanted to make her look her best.

344
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,200
Do you want me to put her in her chair?

345
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,230
Henry?

346
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,330
Call a code!

347
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,800
You looking at the apartment with those or the transit of Mercury?

348
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,990
If night comes, you'll be thanking me.

349
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,470
They're seeking heat. He's an accountant.

350
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,750
How late do you think he's going to party? I bought jar to pee in.

351
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,230
Yeah. <i>We heard crackles in Henry's lungs.</i>

352
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,100
We diuresed him, but he still needs oxygen. Echo shows normal heart function.

353
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,240
Could be high output failure from anemia.

354
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,790
Hematocrit was rock normal. <i>What is this? Mushroom?</i>

355
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,950
<i>Say "mushroom," charge $2.</i>

356
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,800
Say "truffle," charge $5.

357
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,130
Is that the man who wants to marry hooker?

358
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,980
<i>Probably.</i> But he's not the one we're after.

359
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,950
Should we ask? <i>Nope. Oh!</i>

360
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,910
How rude of me not to situate you.
I'm doing Emily a favor.

361
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,670
<i>We're going to track her fiance</i>

362
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:40,460
<i>until Dominika can seduce and expose him</i> as the lying cheater I need him to be.

363
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,720
I'm guessing she didn't ask for this favor.

364
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,340
<i>Oh, you know, the noblest gifts</i> are the ones we give anonymously.

365
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,210
Crackles are nonspecific.

366
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,450
<i>Hypoxia plus bleeding could indicate D.I.C. or some other-</i>

367
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,130
no neurological symptoms?

368
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,580
<i>I knew your bleeding heart would bring you around.</i>

369
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,300
<i>Too bad it's also taking you off the market.</i> And by market, I mean Chase.

370
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,170
<i>Come on, buck up, Chase.</i>

371
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,830
<i>There's always Park. Unless...</i>

372
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,780
How did band practice go?

373
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,570
<i>- Great. - Does she look like she's lying?</i>

374
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,760
Kind of.

375
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,820
Popo needed a ride to the doctor, <i>and my mom couldn't, so-</i>

376
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,060
You're terrified of dating because...

377
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,140
<i>a previous relationship ended because your latent rage</i>

378
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,150
made you vicious in arguments. Or-

379
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,820
<i>Or reincarnation.</i> In a past life, she was Anne Boleyn.

380
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,680
<i>Interesting.</i>

381
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,400
Taub feels confident enough to turn the spotlight on himself.

382
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,320
<i>It's almost as if he wants me to ask...</i>

383
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,570
What's her name?
<i>Wendy Jacobson.</i>

384
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,750
33, Brown grad, family therapist. <i>Nice choice.</i>

385
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,820
Since you got two families to "therapize. "

386
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,580
<i>First date,</i> we didn't discuss everything important-

387
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,610
So it was just a one-night stand.

388
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,090
You're wrong. I actually like her. I'm going to see her again.

389
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,920
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

390
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,660
Great relationships often start with snap decisions <i>aimed at proving me wrong.</i>

391
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,140
Air bubble in the doll could mean the silicone is degrading.

392
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,670
<i>If he hailed some particles...</i>

393
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,380
Silicone deposition. That could work.

394
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,670
Start him on plasmapheresis.

395
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,180
Now, turning to Adams, my theory is tripartite-

396
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,910
Want to hear my thesis? It's kind of interesting.

397
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,460
No man comes out.

398
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:27,850
But old naked lady in 3-C is eating whole block of cheese.

399
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,540
Will this hurt?

400
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,030
No, you might feel a little cold, though.

401
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,900
Crap.

402
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,460
I only have a second, but I went to the time travel lecture.

403
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,950
That is... awesome.

404
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,110
What is it?

405
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,150
It's so...

406
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,220
Oh, realistic.

407
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,540
Oh, and it's all bandaged up.

408
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,370
It is one of those CPR things?

409
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,350
No.

410
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,550
We're starting a procedure. A little privacy-

411
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,810
No, no, it's- it's good that she's here.

412
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,340
<i>Molly,</i>

413
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,750
I'd like you to meet Amy.

414
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,310
What?

415
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,850
I'm serious.

416
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,470
I know it seems a little strange,

417
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,590
<i>but she means a lot to me.</i>

418
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,120
I, um, got to get back to work.

419
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,450
But you just got here. Sit down.
<i>Yeah, but I-</i>

420
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,690
I said that I only had a second.

421
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,570
Enjoy the handouts.

422
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,660
Listen, um, I have to admit something.

423
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,420
Okay.

424
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,630
Her mom isn't dead.
We're separated.

425
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,890
You're the first person I've asked out since then.

426
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,340
I'm not used to explaining... I panicked.

427
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,670
Which I regret, because now that I've gotten to know you,

428
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,670
I like you.

429
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,910
It was a really stupid lie.

430
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,340
I'm sorry.

431
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,810
Was that a different baby?

432
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,990
No...

433
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,920
That was a different baby.

434
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,460
It's nice having you here.

435
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,750
I wish you could come over and get in bed with me.

436
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,600
Like this?

437
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,820
You're talking? It's not all I can do.

438
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,480
Amy, there are doctors...

439
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
I don't know.

440
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,640
Just put your hands on me.

441
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,540
It hurts.
It hurts...

442
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,600
Pushing Lorazepam.

443
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,070
If it wasn't neurological before, it sure is now.

444
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,190
Right upper quadrant's distended.

445
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,110
He's hallucinating because his liver's failing.

446
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,390
Elevated transaminases confirm liver failure.

447
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,490
We'll have to put him on the transplant list in a couple days.

448
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,010
It's clearly not the silicone. Could be vasculitis.

449
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,700
Serologies were negative.

450
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,520
Yeah, if you want Adams to hear,

451
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,960
you might want to not stand so conspicuously far away.

452
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,200
<i>I'm making coffee.</i>

453
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,100
And sometimes, I date co-workers.
Like everyone else on the planet.

454
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,210
Hepatic fibrosis.

455
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,790
If it damaged his platelets,
it'd explain the bleeding.

456
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,550
<i>Unexpected.</i> I actually thought you might agree with my theory.

457
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,440
Because that would mean nothing's your fault.

458
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,920
You fell into relationships based on proximity.
Of course they failed.

459
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,690
<i>But I guess I was wrong.</i>

460
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,540
You picked perfect women. You just screwed it up.

461
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,610
How about all five of us live together and the $7,000 sex doll?

462
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,790
<i>It'll solve all our hang-ups.</i>
$7,000?

463
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,730
Adams suggests that we all sleep together,

464
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,510
and your issue is high prices?
Pretty sure she was joking.

465
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,380
Yes, I'm 99% sure that you're right, but I would never forgive myself-

466
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,040
<i>Those dolls are only $5,000.</i>

467
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,050
He must have had it customized somehow.

468
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,300
Oh, like, you didn't check the website?

469
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,850
I guess we don't need to ask how your dating life is going. I was curious.

470
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,160
Hepatic fibrosis wouldn't cause difficulty breathing.

471
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,380
It would if liver failure opened pulmonary av shunts.

472
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,180
Fibrosis fits.

473
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,200
Start the patient on steroids and find out how he pimped his ride.

474
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,070
Why?

475
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,430
Because I don't know the answer.

476
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,380
Foosball? Can't. Marriage to destroy.

477
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,260
Okay...

478
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,220
"Okay" as in passive-aggressive reverse psychology?

479
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,890
Or as in depressed resignation

480
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,750
"okay" as in I changed my mind.

481
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,040
Expand.

482
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,880
Oh, it's morally reprehensible and bound to fail,

483
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,040
but in a weird way, it's a step forward.
This thing with Emily.

484
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,930
Contract. It's real without being real.

485
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,680
It's a long-term relationship that can't actually hurt you.

486
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,970
It's, um... a stepping stone. It means you want more.

487
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,590
So, passive-aggressive reverse psychology.

488
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,010
Got it.

489
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,700
<i>Try not to come on too strong, okay?</i>

490
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,830
Just get to know him a little. Ease into it.

491
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,920
Why would I ease?
True.

492
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,780
You could just walk up and stick your hand down his pants,

493
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,470
but I heard there's a middle step. Men want to have sex.

494
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,510
Not with crazy people.

495
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,360
Well, yes, a lot with crazy people,
but not that kind of crazy.

496
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,060
Well, yeah, that kind of crazy-

497
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,600
They don't care how crazy if she look like me.

498
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,540
Okay. Easing.

499
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,830
I'm Jennifer, new to marketing department.

500
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,360
Harris. Accounts receivable. Oh, interesting.

501
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,750
Do you want to get out of here and have sex?

502
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,850
Uh, sure.

503
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,550
You know, I got 45 minutes left on my lunch break.

504
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,360
Mm-hmm. Where you wanna go?

505
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,510
Off to a place where men don't cheat on the women they love.

506
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,210
You're not invited, obviously.

507
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,960
Cheating? What are you talking about?

508
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,040
Why, I hope you're speaking

509
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,990
out of some deep kind of moral relativism because-

510
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,780
Who are you people?

511
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,230
You're not Emily's fiance.

512
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,360
Emily's my sister.

513
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,180
We called the company that made Amy.

514
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,680
They said they modeled her after some photos you sent them.

515
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,180
Who is she?

516
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,940
We met last Christmas.

517
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,060
She's a yoga instructor.

518
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,970
Totally different from me.

519
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,220
She-she loved Chopin, hated Indian food.

520
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,950
She changed entire my life for 17 weeks.

521
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,850
My husband cheated on me...

522
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,430
With a girl he met on the plane coming back from our honeymoon.

523
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,230
It's not easy to get past things like that.

524
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,260
She wasn't unfaithful. She didn't betray me.

525
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,230
She just... she just wasn't in love with me.

526
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,110
I know Amy's not going to break your heart.

527
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,640
But she's also not going to change your life.

528
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,850
The lights are bright.

529
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,620
Sorry. What's happening to me?

530
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,720
Is your neck stiff?
Yeah.

531
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,470
I think you have meningitis.

532
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,810
<i>I'm not leaving the business.</i>

533
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,720
I'm just leaving you.

534
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,020
I didn't want you to feel bad.
So let me get this straight.

535
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,700
I'm being dumped by a hooker...

536
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,560
Who's worried about my feelings? You're married.

537
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,240
Half your clients are married.
And you're a hooker.

538
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,570
My other guys sneak around,

539
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,010
but you'll take me into the bedroom while your wife's in the next room.

540
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,030
That's just... mean.

541
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,870
Oh, my God. The marriage, it's a sham.

542
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,270
The only really thing about it is the green card

543
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,570
she's going to get at the end of it.

544
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,680
So, if you want to get the meter running...
It's still mean.

545
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,370
It's not a marriage. It's a felony.

546
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,370
I've seen how she looks at you when you're together. <i>Trust me.</i>

547
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,230
She likes you.

548
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,640
And I've seen how you look at her.

549
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,580
Fever's up 105. He's not responding to meds.

550
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,220
At this rate, he'll be dead by the time we get the cultures back.

551
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,720
Spinal fluid was full of white cells.

552
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,160
Meningitis could be carcinomatous.
Cytology showed nothing.

553
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,620
An amoebic infection would cause fever and meningitis.

554
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,590
But not liver failure. It could if he had a clot.

555
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,080
<i>How could amoebas get past his cribriform plate?</i>

556
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,910
He went swimming in a frozen lake in New Jersey?

557
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,630
Adams said his ex-girlfriend was a yoga instructor.
Maybe he sprained his chakras.

558
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,270
Yoga nuts are way more likely to be into alternative medicine.

559
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,150
He has this little weird teapot in his house.

560
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,290
What was it like?

561
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,260
Um, little. Weird. Teapot-ish.

562
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,760
Like that? Yeah.

563
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,160
You think he drinks some sort of toxic herbal tea?
<i>Yes...</i>

564
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,490
If by "tea," you mean salted tap water.

565
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,470
And by "drink," you mean poured up his nose.

566
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,890
His girlfriend didn't just leave him with a broken heart.

567
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,280
She left him with a neti pot.
It's an Indian method of.

568
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,400
Of clearing the sinuses during allergy season.

569
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,350
Also known as now.

570
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,150
The distilled water can act as a snot flushing system.

571
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,850
With tap water, it can act as an amoeba delivery system

572
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,470
to the fluids around the brain. <i>Start him on metronidazole.</i>

573
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,470
If he's lucky, he'll get to see

574
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,000
his plastic children walk down the aisle.

575
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,760
My neck feels much better.

576
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,710
Your fever's gone, and your liver function's almost back to normal.

577
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:18,580
You should be able to go home soon.
I'm going to have some hospital bills to pay.

578
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,460
I don't suppose used sex dolls go for anything online.

579
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,870
Dr. Adams?

580
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,040
Can I get your email?

581
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,350
What for?

582
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:38,070
I just thought maybe we could see each other again.

583
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,960
I- I can't. <i>No, I know.</i>

584
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,020
It's a professionalism thing, but you won't be my doctor when I get out of here.

585
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,340
It's not that. It's-
<i>what is it?</i>

586
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,030
You said I should change my life.
You were talking about yourself, too.

587
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,910
I know you were. Henry, I- I think you should ask Molly out.

588
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,430
I should have known this would happen.

589
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,130
You're a good guy, Henry.

590
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,920
You deserve more than a doll.

591
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,890
Promise me you'll keep trying.

592
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,980
Okay.

593
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,670
Date tonight?

594
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,880
So she can't deal.
There's someone out there who can.

595
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,460
You just got to find her.

596
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,870
I'd love to prove House wrong,but... 

597
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,260
I ruined my marriage,

598
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,850
broke two people's hearts, had two kids who are always

599
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:53,190
going to wonder why I didn't love their mommy enough.

600
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,680
It's better if I just... focus on what I do have.

601
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,210
Give that band guy a call.

602
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,700
I'm not that good at guitar.

603
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,630
Or flirting or small talk.

604
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,310
I'm not as pretty as Adams,

605
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,600
I have stuffy clothes, and I hate my hair.

606
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,910
Adams works 80 hours a week fixing bunions on hobos

607
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,460
because she can't face getting to know someone new.

608
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,330
Trust me.

609
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,360
You find a boyfriend, she'll be the jealous one.

610
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,580
See you tomorrow.

611
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,950
Do you...

612
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,480
want to get a drink?

613
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,840
To annoy Park or to prove House wrong?

614
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,060
Oh, I... It's just, um...

615
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,420
I think it's time for a change.

616
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,430
I don't really think that's a good idea for me right now.

617
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,800
House has a way of getting in people's heads.

618
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,310
Yeah. Yeah.

619
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,740
No, mom. I'm still at work.

620
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,500
I'll be home in a couple hours.

621
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,030
Love you too.

622
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,950
Ready?

623
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,410
One, two, three, four.

624
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,430
*they say we're young and we don't know *

625
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,040
