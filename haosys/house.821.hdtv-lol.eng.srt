1
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,750
come on in.

2
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,430
i'm not doing any more chemo.

3
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,140
good plan. you'll be dead in five months.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,770
we went for a cure. it didn't work.

5
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,100
i've thought about this a lot.

6
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,090
five more months on this earth is reasonable.

7
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,380
a year in the hospital in excruciating pain is...

8
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,520
not.

9
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,140
with two weeks on, two weeks off of chemo, you'll have way more than a year,

10
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,370
maybe two or three.

11
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,770
house...

12
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,180
i'm sorry.

13
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,430
i'm not gonna let you just die.

14

17
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,280
hey. you know, management research shows that the best ideas come from casual contact.

18
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,510
<i>so... one set of season tickets.</i>

19
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,250
got the seat next to you.

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,760
first game is october 8th.

21
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,210
<i>that's about one month after wilson's expiration date.</i>

22
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,770
this isn't an unstructured collaboration.

23
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,210
you're trying to be the new wilson.

24
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,160
i'm trying to show you there are other people who care about you.

25
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,030
relax.

26
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,510
i'm probably not gonna fall apart.

27
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,050
five, six, seven, eight.

28
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,390
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

29
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,240
<i>one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.</i>

30
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,420
<i>here we go.</i>

31
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,360
<i>cradle! one, two, three, four-- put down the pom-poms.</i>

32
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,670
<i>step away from the computer. 46-year-old oncologist refuses treatment.</i>

33
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,650
<i> foreman already gave us a case.</i>

34
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,540
wants us to keep things as normal as possible for as long as possible.

35
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,840
wilson is dying. chase is gone.

36
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,280
how close to normal do you think we can come?

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,350
19-year-old cheerleader admitted with massive nosebleed and dizziness.

38
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,650
wow. cool.

39
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,700
i just completely forgot that my best friend is dying.

40
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,330
wait. that just reminded me. head ct is clean.

41
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,750
how can we turn wilson from a terminal idiot into an interminable pain in the ass?

42
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,670
<i>mini stroke could explain our patient's neurosymptoms and his butterfingers.</i>

43
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,950
but not his bloody nose.

44
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,300
my best friend is trying to kill himself.

45
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,800
he just wants to die with a little dignity.

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,680
there's no such thing.

47
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,930
<i>it's not your choice, house.</i>

48
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,500
your only choice here is between acceptance and misery.

49
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,180
it's a midline granuloma. get your patient a pet scan.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,760
no lesions along the optic track? you already covered that.

51
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,540
maybe we should get someone else to take this case.

52
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,910
why? because someone somewhere is dying?

53
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,230
oh, crap, turn off the mike! it is off.

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,720
not according to his brain.

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,300
his temporal lobe is completely lit up.

56
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,470
auditory portion.

57
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,840
he's hearing something.

58
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,310
foreman's trying to date me.

59
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,090
<i>i assume that's because you called him.</i>

60
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,970
no, i--
did you...

61
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,840
 put something in my coffee?

62
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,210
you know how you can be there for me five months from now?

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,320
don't be dead five months from now.

64
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,280
hey, wils--

65
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,290
<i>seriously? just a little picker-downer.</i>

66
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,830
<i>i assume this unwanted interruption means you're looking for me to discuss the latest development</i>

67
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,170
in the case i don't want to discuss.

68
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,670
<i> our patient is hearing voices.</i>

69
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,820
he denies it, but the pet scan says otherwise.

70
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,830
he's at the right age for the onset of schizophrenia.

71
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,950
yeah. you really need me.

72
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,800
ultrasound his abdomen to check for schizophrenia.

73
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,180
we already ordered a psych evaluation, but drugs could also cause--

74
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,320
tox screen was clean. ultrasound his dorm.

75
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,440
 whoa, just...

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,950
you guys can't just come busting in here without a warrant.

77
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,140
we're not cops. we're your roommate's doctors.

78
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,980
any idea what flavor of drugs would be making your roommate sick?

79
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,090
<i>objection.</i>

80
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,580
entrapment.

81
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,210
i'm pre-law.

82
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,870
<i>derrick doesn't party.</i>

83
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,960
look at this. why would he have a picture of a little boy?

84
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
maybe it's his nephew or something?

85
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,740
hidden in his sock drawer?

86
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,420
whoa! creepy. 

87
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,210
<i>we need to talk to derrick about some medical matters.</i>

88
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,700
well, she's my girlfriend. she can be here for that.

89
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,230
we found this... in your dorm room.

90
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,190
who is that?

91
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,690
nobody.

92
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,890
then why was it hidden in a drawer?

93
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,250
derrick, what's she talking about?

94
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,090
it's my brother christopher.

95
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,880
you never told me you had a brother.

96
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,770
well, he's been dead almost ten years, so...

97
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,670
is that the voice you hear in your head?

98
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,030
and lo, he is risen.

99
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,890
so now my hair's gonna fall out next week?

100
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,390
no. all i did was temporarily kill you.

101
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,670
how was it? what--i don't-- i wasn't dead.

102
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,720
i was unconscious. no dreams, no thoughts.

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,950
you experienced nothing.

104
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,650
now, imagine that without the waking up on the couch part.

105
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,620
just nothing times infinity.

106
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,580
you didn't just prove death is nothing.

107
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,800
you proved propofol is.

108
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,610
you're saying the end is not the end?

109
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,860
i was expecting "nothing is better than something lousy,"

110
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,050
but not "the angels are waiting for me." i'm not having this conversation.

111
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,550
why? 'cause it doesn't make sense?

112
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,090
because i'm not gonna change your mind, and i don't care.

113
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,010
more importantly, you're not gonna change mine.

114
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,610
there is no heaven. there is no hell.

115
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,880
your soul is not gonna float out of your body and join some great unifying energy force.

116
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
the fact that you're dying is not gonna change that.

117
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,480
please...just go.

118
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,710
house.

119
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,460
i have spent the last 20 years holding the hands of people as they die.

120
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,160
when i watch that transformation...

121
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,610
i'm sorry, i...

122
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,980
don't believe that we're just a bag of chemicals.

123
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,500
so are we gonna talk about the patient or wait for house?

124
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,250
viral encephalitis. it's been going on for ten years.

125
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,140
i'm gonna go in there and invite him to participate.

126
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,840
i think he'd welcome the distraction.

127
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,580
come with me?

128
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,990
why?

129
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,920
<i>when was the last time house listened to anything we said about anything personal?</i>

130
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,620
<i>maybe you'll feel better,</i>

131
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:05,700
but sometimes the truth is there's nothing anyone can do.

132
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,180
temporal lobe epilepsy.

133
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,040
<i>causes voices, dizziness. trauma from seizure would explain the nose bleed.</i>

134
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,500
you know about all of my siblings and cousins and aunts and uncles and--

135
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,660
you're overreacting.

136
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,740
<i>because you don't trust me enough to tell me-- sorry.</i>

137
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,650
it's time to go down for your test.

138
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,530
if you wanna wait here, it'll only take about an hour.

139
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,050
no. she's leaving.

140
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,760
derrick, come on. i mean, we should at least talk.

141
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,200
no i'd rather you just leave.

142
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,070
and you don't need to come back.

143
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,220
<i>time. any odd tastes or smells?</i>

144
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,120
nope. feel fine.

145
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,700
things look fine on my end too.

146
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,340
so...

147
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,900
you won't admit to your doctors that you're hearing your brother's voice,

148
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,830
which is dangerous.

149
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,270
and now you lost your girlfriend over it,
which is stupid.

150
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,310
i assume there's more to the story?

151
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,100
that's how i was raised. short story.

152
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,290
yeah.

153
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,760
my boss is losing his best friend to cancer.

154
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,380
and instead of talking about the pain,

155
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,680
he's pretending there is no pain because everything can be fixed.

156
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,010
my father tried to deal with it.

157
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,640
ironic that he'd drink himself into oblivion

158
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,820
after my brother was killed by a drunk driver.

159
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,870
do you need a tissue?

160
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,180
after dad left, my mom moved us away.

161
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,550
she got rid of all the pictures of christopher
and never mentioned him again.

162
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,430
it was like he never existed.

163
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,480
and that worked for us.

164
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,290
and yet, you kept one.

165
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,650
uh, my right eye...

166
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,730
i was seeing spots, but now i can't see at all.

167
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,950
is that from the test? no. this is something else.

168
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,540
aah! that hurts.

169
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,120
sorry.

170
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,900
how many fingers? two. fuzzy ones, but two.

171
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,850
there's a clot in the artery behind your eye.

172
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,670
i just broke it up. is that bad?

173
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,050
don't know, because i don't know why it happened.

174
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,070
hey. saved us a table. there are no tables.

175
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,900
i recently hacked into your old files.

176
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,550
found a six-year-old boy with bilateral retinoblastoma.

177
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,620
doctors wanted to take his eyes out before the cancer spread to his brain,

178
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,030
and you fought them.

179
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,840
advocated for a new photon beam radiation.

180
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,200
saved the kid's vision. probably saved his life.

181
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,900
that was my first case at ppth. mikey kimble.

182
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,280
<i>it's michael now.</i>

183
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,320
oh, yeah. this is our table.

184
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,000
i...

185
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,510
how are you? i'm doing great.

186
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,770
i'm graduating next month.

187
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,180
already? little mikey?

188
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,200
and i got accepted to princeton.

189
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,710
and i'm planning on going to med school.

190
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,440
<i>he's going to be a doctor instead of being dead.</i>

191
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,460
<i>dr. house told me all about your situation.</i>

192
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,250
<i>that's why i came.</i>

193
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,940
<i>there's just so much good that you can do, even in a small amount of time.</i>

194
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,550
i wonder...

195
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,990
is there anybody else here who's alive today because of dr. james wilson?

196
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,550
gastric adenocarcinoma. 15 years in remission.

197
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,410
<i>six grandchildren that i never would have met.</i>

198
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,150
thank you, dr. wilson.

199
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,680
<i>squamous cell lung cancer. 12 years in remission.</i>

200
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,130
i was able to walk my daughter down the aisle last may.

201
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,830
thank you, dr. wilson.

202
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,670
<i>i did the math. 74 children are alive today</i>

203
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,590
because of you. 14 grandchildren.

204
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,020
mikey kimble started kindergarten before the age cutoff.

205
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,620
he would have graduated high school last year.

206
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,880
i flunked a year.

207
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,960
was anybody in this room really a patient of mine?

208
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,560
they're somewhere.

209
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,280
they're giving you a standing "o" somewhere.

210
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,250
they exist. you saved their lives.

211
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,530
actually, more impressive-- they're too busy to be here.

212
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,120
what's this?

213
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,730
a glowing letter of recommendation you just wrote for me on my laptop.

214
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,170
i notice it's lacking your signature at the bottom.

215
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,170
don't you think you're being a bit premature predicting house's demise?

216
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,920
not demise. just implosion.

217
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,330
he's going through a rough time, but so far, he's been handling it--

218
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,250
house.

219
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,010
your shoes are wet!

220
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,170
glad to see your emotional turmoil hasn't dulled your powers of observation.

221
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,560
i know you're responsible.

222
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,530
no, you don't. 'cause i didn't do it.

223
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,790
<i>whatever it is.</i>

224
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,930
but if i had shoved those season tickets down some toilets,

225
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,470
i would have done it because you asked me to.

226
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,460
you wanted to replace wilson. i prank wilson all the time.

227
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,870
enjoy.

228
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,830
i got you three, but i drank them.

229
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,990
you didn't have to call me, but i appreciate i made the list.

230
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,250
it wasn't entirely unselfish.

231
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,160
i didn't feel right approaching any of my terminal patients,

232
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,030
<i>but...</i>

233
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,440
what is it like?

234
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,950
does it ever stop being surreal?

235
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,630
it'll stop in about...

236
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,260
five or six months, give or take, in your case.

237
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,680
you know what happened to me today?

238
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,190
one of my patients suddenly started crying.

239
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,250
it can't be your first.

240
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,190
the first one... who was crying for me.

241
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,380
it's the human response.

242
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,660
it's either overly saccharine, because giving sympathy makes them feel better,

243
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,180
<i>or they ignore you,</i>

244
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,240
because hiding from mortality makes them feel better.

245
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,860
<i>why can't they just say something that makes me feel better?</i>

246
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,150
like what, exactly?

247
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,700
<i>i don't know.
no.</i>

248
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,490
no.

249
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,600
you'd be doing what, two weeks on, two weeks off?

250
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,770
so maybe do your first round, see how it goes.

251
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,940
<i>maybe not as horrible as you fear.</i>

252
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,560
then do the second round, enjoy your two weeks off,

253
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,690
and revisit the decision. rinse, repeat.

254
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,310
i just can't envision spending my remaining time

255
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,000
in a chemo suite in princeton.

256
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,240
i want to...

257
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,430
enjoy myself with family and friends.

258
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,520
friends or friend?

259
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,820
hi, this is greg house. again.

260
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,690
third message, hopefully indicating how much i want you to call me back.

261
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,780
i'd say that your son is dying to increase the urgency,

262
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,050
but you probably already know that.

263
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,300
the fake people who care that wilson stays alive didn't work,

264
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,240
so i need the real people who care about him to tell him what an idiot he's being.

265
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,370
where are we going? i just got paged to go to the bathroom.

266
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,190
i don't know where the rest of you are going.

267
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,060
some of our patient's symptoms might be physiological,

268
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,720
and some might be psychological.

269
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,780
you think being forced to bury painful memories is making symptoms worse?

270
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,770
grief avoidance can lead to all sorts of anxiety disorders,

271
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,320
which can manifest into physical illness.

272
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,040
let's assume...that all his symptoms are real symptoms.

273
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,190
so we're going to avoid grief avoidance?

274
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,780
studies after september 11th showed that repression was actually better for coping

275
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,340
than dwelling in misery.

276
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,940
<i>what about polycythemia vera? 
rbcs are slightly elevated, but not that much.</i>

277
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,220
hodgkin's lymphoma? 
would have showed up in the pet scan.

278
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,850
what if your guy got hurt at practice?

279
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,700
and, like everything else, just didn't tell anyone.

280
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,050
could have set off dic, would explain everything.

281
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,210
i thought you had to go to the bathroom. i didn't say i had to go in.

282
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,950
need some more mops in here!

283
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,170
what exactly are you looking for?

284
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,800
blood. if your spinal fluid is yellow instead of clear,

285
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,540
<i>it means you've had a subarachnoid hemorrhage.</i>

286
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,390
what does your brother say to you?

287
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,930
does he tell you you're gonna be okay?

288
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,750
doesn't really work like that.

289
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,170
i think you hear your brother's voice for a reason.

290
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,820
thought you guys said that i hear things
because i'm sick.

291
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,030
 yes. but that doesn't explain why you don't hear a different voice.

292
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,220
i think your mom didn't let you deal with the grief of losing your brother properly.

293
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,060
<i>there are people here who could help you with that.</i>

294
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,760
okay.

295
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,900
the opening pressure's way too high.

296
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,570
the prodigal daughter returns.

297
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,670
you taking me up on my offer to off you?

298
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,880
think i've still got some leftover propofol.

299
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,430
spoke to wilson.

300
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,850
he's angry because i want him to live longer.

301
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,020
who wouldn't be? friends respect each other's decisions,

302
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,370
even if they don't agree with them. it's called loyalty.

303
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,130
loyalty is a tool to get people to do things they don't wanna do.

304
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,460
but you do want to.

305
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,890
you may have rationalized it a hundred different ways,

306
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,020
but the fact is, you fired me so that i'd be forced

307
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,310
to spend the rest of my life doing exactly what i wanted to do.

308
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,260
it was probably the most...

309
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,980
selfless thing anyone has ever done for me.

310
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,500
and you don't even like me that much.

311
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,200
i surrender.

312
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,950
i have been a disloyal...

313
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,270
disrespectful jerk.

314
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,560
i should have listened to what you wanted.

315
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,770
i'm still not letting my parents return your call.

316
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,500
i made a reservation for two at carmine's.

317
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,350
tonight. 8:00.

318
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,730
no more tricks. no more manipulations.

319
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,610
said machiavelli.

320
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,740
<i>just...</i>

321
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,200
two friends enjoying the time they have left.

322
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,640
please, don't-- i'm not. i promise.

323
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,530
just dinner? that depends on how much you have to drink.

324
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,070
that sounds nice.

325
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,720
mom.

326
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,820
i came as soon as i got your message. is he gonna be okay?

327
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,430
we're hoping it's just excess fluid on his brain from an extreme migraine,

328
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,050
<i>which isn't good, but it's treatable.</i>

329
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,890
he's scheduled to get an mri as soon as these meds start taking effect.

330
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,250
we found that picture in his dorm room.

331
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,000
i'm not sure what derrick's told you, but...

332
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,900
he's been hearing christopher's voice for the last ten years.

333
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,800
<i>and it's possible that repressing all that grief he's felt</i>

334
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,540
<i>is actually causing some of derrick's symptoms.</i>

335
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,780
i don't even know if this voice in my head is something i invented

336
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,630
or if it's what christopher was really like.

337
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,210
with no photos, no video...

338
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,020
my memories...

339
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,090
i really don't have any anymore.

340
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,480
maybe you could just...

341
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,540
tell me a little bit about him?

342
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,540
i'm sorry. it was a long drive in.

343
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,280
i'm gonna go get a coffee.

344
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,100
okay.

345
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,320
97 years old,

346
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,750
and you told her she was pregnant.

347
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,730
well, it cured her hiccups.

348
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,370
i didn't expect her to cry for quite so long.

349
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,350
now, i know that the tiramisu is great here,

350
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,260
but i actually ordered off-menu.

351
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,040
great.

352
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,760
i told you you didn't hang the bear bag high enough.

353
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,170
it was a smart bear. i'm almost certain he untied my knots.

354
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,470
well, he wasn't that smart. he left the oreos behind.

355
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:21,210
you hiked for 32 miles eating nothing but creamy filling.

356
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,580
the black stuff is overrated.

357
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,360
to climbing the hill.

358
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,580
okay.

359
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,480
if i did decide to...

360
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,480
stick around a little longer--

361
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,190
don't do that to me, wilson.

362
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,990
no, i'm not, i'm just--

363
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,600
i do feel pretty good and i...

364
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,700
maybe i should try it for a little while.

365
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,080
well, i...

366
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,140
i think that's reasonable.

367
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,680
are you c-conning me?

368
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,850
you're conning me.

369
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,790
just because you folded,

370
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,760
that means it must be some evil plan?

371
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,960
well, that's usually how it works with you.

372
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,740
you drown me in nostalgia so i'll think about our friendship

373
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,450
and feel some kind of loyalty and agree to more chemo!

374
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,760
that was real nostalgia. it was real emotions, a real decision.

375
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,130
a decision that i just made for you!

376
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,660
i need you, okay?

377
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,490
i want you to be around as long as possible.

378
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,110
'cause i don't know what i'm gonna do without you.

379
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,720
no. no.

380
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,460
don't do that.

381
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,100
i don't owe you anything.

382
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,110
our entire relationship has been about you.

383
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,310
my dying is about me.

384
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,080
look at you. you don't wanna die.

385
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,330
of course, i don't wanna die! well, then fight.

386
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,070
i did! i tried. one time.

387
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,780
house, get out of my car.

388
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,300
you don't have to just accept this. yes, i do have to accept this.

389
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,810
i have five months to live, and you're making me go through this alone!

390
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,470
i'm pissed because i'm dying, and it's not fair.

391
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,700
and i need...

392
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,870
i need a friend. i need to know that you're there.

393
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,670
i need--

394
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,260
i need you to tell me that my life...

395
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,150
was worthwhile, and i...

396
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,320
i need you to tell me that you love me.

397
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,940
no.

398
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,940
i'm not gonna tell you that unless you fight.

399
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,450
blood vessels are nonreactive. it's not a migraine.

400
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,190
<i>i'm not feeling so great. how much longer?</i>

401
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,560
finishing up.

402
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,980
thank you, dr. adams.

403
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,380
it looks like the ceiling might collapse.

404
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,250
what are you doing back here? we got a case.

405
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,680
assume the status is: patient's getting worse.

406
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,860
you guys are confused.

407
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,870
you think actually showing up for work

408
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:34,040
<i>is enough to make up for ruining an mri, endangering the patient,injuring us?</i>

409
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,150
 i got an airtight alibi that i'm working on.

410
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,410
this isn't about the damage.

411
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,920
you're back because something's going on with wilson. i'm done with wilson.

412
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,640
what does that mean, you're done with wilson? if he's not dead, you're not done with wilson.

413
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,700
you suddenly think you're gonna make a difference?

414
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,930
you can't just abandon him. it's in his hands now.

415
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,450
get any good pictures before the mri drowned?

416
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,660
enough to know it wasn't a migraine.

417
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,620
and the patient mistook me for adams.

418
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,300
come with me.

419
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,660
so what do you think's gonna happen when i stick a needle into his eardrum?

420
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,540
you quizzing us? oh, this is a good quiz.

421
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,880
<i>he'll scream in pain. don't listen to her.</i>

422
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,180
very small needle, very steady hand.

423
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,570
now, when i pull back on the plunger, what do you think's gonna come out?

424
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,860
air.

425
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,910
boy, that air sure is red.

426
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,700
persistent stapedial artery.

427
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,420
it should disappear in the embryonic stage, but just like his dead brother,

428
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,990
<i>he really can't let go.</i>

429
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,710
an artery's been pressing against the temporal lobe of his brain, right above the ear canal.

430
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,330
it explains the voices, the dizziness, everything.

431
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,780
now you guys can explain how we're gonna make him better.

432
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,990
will my brother's voice go away?

433
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,400
you're being an ass.

434
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,010
i just cured a patient. how 'bout you?

435
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,380
you can't just give up on wilson. you know he needs you.

436
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,930
you know he's making an impossible choice. he just doesn't want to live in pain.

437
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,000
life is pain! i wake up every morning, i'm in pain.

438
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,220
i go to work in pain. you know how many times i wanted to just give up?

439
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,270
how many times i thought about ending it?

440
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,360
you here to yell at me or give me hockey tickets?

441
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,200
had to delay the surgery because our patient drank ammonia from the janitor's cart.

442
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,400
<i>i guess...</i>

443
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,950
he didn't want to live without his brother's voice.

444
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,190
where are you going?

445
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,190
you can't wait to die?

446
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,440
here, let me help you. hey! house!

447
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,320
<i>house! see? you wanna live! he did something stupid.</i>

448
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,360
he's not gonna do it again.

449
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,260
you're resisting me because it's our human responsibility to stay alive!

450
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,890
you made your point, house! stop!

451
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,450
you've spent your whole life looking for the truth.

452
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,760
but sometimes the truth just sucks.

453
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,510
i'm, uh...

454
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,270
i'm gonna be leaving, uh, quite a bit earlier than we had talked about.

455
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,490
the...next day or two.

456
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,410
what happened?

457
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,240
something between you and house?

458
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,310
he's not my child.

459
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:34,470
i cannot be responsible for the happiness of gregory house.

460
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,500
well, uh...i'll get these to frankel.

461
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,250
okay. thank you.

462
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,650
you are responsible.

463
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:54,330
the past 20 years you've had three wives,

464
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,570
hundreds of colleagues, thousands of patients.

465
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,360
but you've kept that one best friend.

466
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,740
he wants me to suffer a misery

467
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,600
that i don't want to go through.

468
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,770
chemo won't make your life any better.

469
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,760
but caring will.

470
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,950
enduring pain to do some good for someone you care about...

471
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,750
isn't that what life is?

472
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,480
mom?

473
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,810
yeah?

474
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,570
that picture of christopher that i had on the stand.

475
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,750
did you take it?

476
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,280
yes. did you throw it out?

477
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:05,920
if i agree to get the surgery, can you bring that picture back?

478
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,040
<i>not home. 
house.</i>

479
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,800
i'm ready to start the next round of chemo.

480
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,090
why?

481
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,940
because you need me

482
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,410
and...

483
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,800
i don't think that's a bad thing anymore.

484
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,700
no.

485
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,210
you're the only one i listen to.

486
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,870
the last couple of days, i didn't, and i almost killed my patient.

487
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,970
so i think it's time for me to accept that...

488
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,100
you're just smarter than i am.

489
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,800
are you really okay

490
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,270
that there's only five months left?

491
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,130
no.

492
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,890
but it's better than nothing.

493
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,810
how do we start?

494
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,620
i'm not gonna say "i love you."

495
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,370
thank god. you got any oreos?

496
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,540
how are you feeling?

497
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,500
the surgery worked.

498
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,750
how can you tell?

499
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,760
'cause christopher's gone.

500
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,210
and this is the peak. almost 8,000 feet.

501
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,440
you do realize that my leg situation has deteriorated a little

502
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,840
since the last time we went hiking. just add another day.

503
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,240
this is matt johnson, the hospital lawyer.

504
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:54,220
yes. i have decided not to proceed with the sexual harassment case.

505
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,190
are these yours?

506
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,450
<i>the plumber retrieved them from the hospital outflow pipe.</i>

507
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:05,830
they caused a sewage backup that ruined the mri, and they have your name on them.

508
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,020
gregory danger house.

509
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,300
it's...a very common name.

510
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,500
these apparently have your fingerprints on them also.

511
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,180
okay. why don't you tell me
how many hours of picking up trash you want me to do.

512
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,540
house...i tried to keep this internal.

513
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:29,630
<i>the fire department handed the tickets to the police who contacted your parole officer.</i>

514
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,950
<i>it's felony vandalism.</i>

515
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,180
<i>he's gonna revoke your parole. there's nothing we can do.</i>

516
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,310
you have to report to mercer county jail on monday to serve out the rest of your sentence.

517
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,450
and that's... that's how long?

518
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,980
i'm sorry. how long?

519
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,000
six  months

520
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,630
