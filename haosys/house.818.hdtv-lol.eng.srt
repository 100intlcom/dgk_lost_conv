1
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,110
Who are you?

2
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,450
What are you doing? Get out of here!

3
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,800
Mom!

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,960
<i>Lue? Lue?</i> You okay?

5
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,970
Okay, honey. Calm down. It's all right.

6
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,000
You're just having another bad dream.

7
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,120
I can't breathe! Yes, you can.

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,310
You're fine. Just relax.

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,250
Just take slow, deep breaths.

10
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,250
Nice and easy. There's nothing to be afraid of.

11
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm... trying... But I can't!

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,760
Relax. Slow, deep breaths.

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I... can't.

14
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,840
Lue?

15
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,830
Oh, my God. Lue?

16
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,180
Lue, wake up!
Wake up, Lue! Come on!

17
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,690
Lue!

18
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:44,400

豪斯医生  第八季第18集</font>

21
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,980
 Been paging you for over two hours.

22
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,160
I must've been in the shower.
Then I had to moisturize.

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,410
Eight-year-old boy was brought into the ER last night with acute respiratory distress.

24
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,670
No history of-

25
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,460
no histories of asthma or allergies,

26
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,710
and his chest X- ray's clear. Actually, I had to moisturize twice.

27
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,760
Dominika made oysters Rockefeller last night.

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,850
Kid's been having night terrors.
Woke up in the middle of one in full respiratory arrest.

29
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,990
Stress induced panic attack.

30
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,170
Tell the parents to lay off the grades. The world needs fry cooks too.

31
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,330
Does great in school.

32
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,830
The parents are divorced, but it was amicable.
And the dad's moved out of state.

33
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,970
Have you seen Wilson around?

34
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,820
The dreams are about an ugly, old hag

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,300
trying to strangle him.

36
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,090
The family's Hmong.

37
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,240
????

38
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,640
sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome,

39
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,310
aka BS name for no one's figured out why they died.

40
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,000
Over 100 in the early '80s.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
Only male. Only Hmong.

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,640
Healthy right up until the moment

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,610
they died in their sleep.

44
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,330
What was he dreaming about? It doesn't matter.

45
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,580
<i>It's a dream.</i> It doesn't mean anything.

46
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,130
If the nightmare's scary enough,

47
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,910
meaningful or not, it could cause a catecholamine surge and ventricular fibrillation.

48
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,050
An ancient demon called a Dab was sitting on him, strangling him.

49
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,650
I think that qualifies. Except in the rational part of the file,

50
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,290
where it says his EKG's within normal limits.

51
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,710
<i>It's not his heart.</i> What about obstructive sleep apnea?

52
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,200
Sleep apnea wouldn't have caused breathing problems after he woke up.

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,950
What did you dream of? I never remember my dreams.

54
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,920
But you're certain that they're insignificant.

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,360
Defensively so. I was defending science.

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,170
You were defensively defending science.

57
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,750
Lung damage from inhaled toxins could keep causing problems after he woke up.

58
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,040
Or an upper respiratory infection.

59
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,450
Okay, Chase and Park,

60
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,540
start iv antibiotics for pneumonia.

61
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,400
Taub and Adams, go check the home for toxins.

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,420
Could I go with Taub? It was my idea.

63
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,990
Right... 'cause for a moment there, I thought you were uncomfortable around Chase

64
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,450
because you'd had a nocturnal Australian.

65
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,190
You can go with whoever you want.

66
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,790
But all of you, read all of these files.

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,760
Do you believe a spirit could be hurting your son?

68
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,890
No, of course not.

69
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,610
Because if he's been taught to believe that,

70
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,700
it is possible for the fear alone to affect heart function.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,920
I'm an engineer.

72
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,400
I know illnesses aren't caused by evil spirits.

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,330
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, I just... had to check.

74
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,350
Anything else you need to check?

75
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,150
No.

76
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,330
I had a dream.
House...

77
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,800
We can talk later. Relax, I'm a Doctor.

78
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Your spectacular breasts mean nothing to me.

79
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,090
House...

80
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,350
House!

81
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,660
Later.

82
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,660
I had sex with Dominika.
In a dream?

83
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,420
It wasn't literally sex.

84
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,400
Technically, it was flossing.
You know, teeth, testicles.

85
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,250
I think the symbolism is pretty clear.

86
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,560
"Later" just changed to "never. "

87
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll tell you what would be weirder, <i>if you didn't dream about having sex with Chase.</i>

88
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,020
Have you? No.

89
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,590
But I've dreamed about having sex with a lot of people I work with,

90
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,390
and it didn't freak me out. That's different.

91
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,680
How?

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,360
'Cause you've actually had sex with a lot of people at work,

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,990
and that hasn't freaked you out. Good point.

94
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,000
So you're worried about what it means?

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,690
I'm not worried. It means nothing.

96
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,190
It means something, doesn't it?

97
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,990
I work with him.
I can't want to sleep with him.

98
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,440
Maybe Chase just represents work.

99
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,890
You're just falling in love with your job.

100
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,660
It has been very satisfying lately.
You smell that?

101
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,120
Yeah. Smells like wet dog.

102
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,950
It's mold.

103
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,230
It's not mold. It's definitely mold.

104
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,170
I don't see any sign of water damage.

105
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,270
<i>Holy crap.</i>

106
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,590
It looked like a slaughterhouse.
I don't know what you're talking about.

107
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,200
It was clean when we left.

108
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,390
You're telling us some random person broke into your house to dismember a pig

109
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,040
in your son's bedroom? A pig?

110
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,960
My father-in-law.

111
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,730
What did you do?

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,310
What you should have done weeks ago, <i>when the dreams started.</i>

113
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,140
I'm saving Lue. <i>He's coding!</i>

114
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,960
<i>Need a Doctor in here!</i>

115
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,910
V- tach. No pulse.

116
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,790
Oh, my God! Push 1 milligram EPI!

117
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,040
Paddles. Charge to 50. Charging!

118
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,430
Clear!

119
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,710
Baby... Still V-tach!

120
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,250
Charge to 100!
100!

121
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,660
Clear!

122
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,280
Charge- wait!
Normal sinus rhythm.

123
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,270
Oh, God!

124
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,540
He's stable, but we've obviously got a second symptom.

125
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, kid in V-tach. Tell me about the luau in his bedroom.

126
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,470
It's a traditional Hmong ceremony that's supposed to call back the kid's soul.

127
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,630
<i>Hasn't he heard of star-69? There's more.</i>

128
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,940
The reason grandpa thinks the kid's soul is stolen is because he's convinced his son, the kid's father,

129
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,090
<i>had his stolen as well.</i> He beat his boss to death.

130
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,120
The dad didn't move away. He's in prison.

131
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,850
PTSD could definitely cause breathing problems-
It's not PTSD.

132
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,950
Even if the kid wasn't there, just hearing what the dad did-

133
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,910
But he hasn't. It happened when he was two, and all he's ever been told is that

134
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,570
his parents divorced and his dad moved away.

135
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,710
The heart thing indicates a malignant arrhythmia. <i>He needs an E.P. study.</i>

136
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,620
How many of the other files showed malignant arrhythmias?

137
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,600
None, but- Forget the E.P.

138
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,320
What about acute pericarditis? <i>Explains the dyspnea.</i>

139
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,240
How many of the other files-
<i>it's exacerbated by lying supine,</i>

140
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,840
so the symptoms would get worse when he goes to sleep.

141
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,160
Just like all 100 of the others.

142
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,180
Do an echo to check the pericardium.

143
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,510
See if you can find any cardioactive toxins

144
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,080
in the home samples.

145
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,250
Can I just say that I very much enjoy my job?

146
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,660
<i>No, no, please.</i>

147
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,570
No need to apologize for your earlier behavior.

148
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,820
<i>Floss was mint</i> probably because of this green G-string

149
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,120
she hangs up to dry in the bathroom. My watch must have stopped.

150
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,590
Apparently it's already "never. " You might want to forward your calls.

151
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,390
You do not want <i>the Reader's Digest version on this.</i>

152
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,520
There was a very tight hygienist's uniform,

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,550
suggestive use of the water sprayer-

154
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,060
The floss isn't sex. It's guilt.

155
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,230
<i>It's tying you up for throwing away</i> <i>the I.N.S. notification</i>

156
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,750
granting Dominika her citizenship.

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,760
She can move out, but she still doesn't know it,

158
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,930
which means you're basically holding her prisoner.

159
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,080
<i>Tell her the truth,</i>

160
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,880
and leave me alone.

161
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,170
Really? What? You startled me.

162
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,910
We work together every day, usually under a fair amount of stress.

163
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,600
It's only natural I'd pop into a subconscious thought every once in a while.

164
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,680
Have you ever dreamt about having sex with me? No.

165
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,620
You paused.

166
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,660
No, I didn't. You think I'm lying?

167
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,760
No, I think you're fighting the urge to snap the word "no" because your subconscious

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,180
finds the idea abhorrent.

169
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,750
So if I snap, it's offensive, and if I don't snap, it's offensive for the exact same reason?

170
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,640
Talk to your subconscious.

171
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,170
This is becoming weird because you're making it weird.

172
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,050
So you don't find the idea abhorrent? I work with you.

173
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,180
I don't have to answer that question.

174
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,920
You just did.

175
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,070
What happened?

176
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,040
Echo was negative,
but he has severe abdominal pain.

177
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,490
Ultrasound didn't suggest any intestinal blockages,

178
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,130
but he's severely constipated.

179
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,540
No spores, clostridium, or organic toxins in the kitchen samples. Nothing in the bedroom either.

180
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,460
We need to scope him, and we're gonna need to clear his bowel first.

181
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,890
We should biopsy his thyroid. For an impacted bowel?

182
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,390
Hashimoto's thyroiditis would explain his lung, heart, and intestinal involvement.

183
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,440
And if you think we still need house's approval,

184
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,820
it also explains dying in your sleep.

185
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,280
Nice call.

186
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,520
When you invite me for dinner, I thought maybe you take me to a restaurant.

187
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,100
Or have plates.

188
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,570
Yeah, sorry.
Idiot delivery guy forgot them.

189
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,390
Mm... the idiot delivery guy,

190
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,290
or the idiot guy whose food you stole from lounge refrigerator, huh?

191
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,500
You've gotten to know me pretty well.

192
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,940
My citizenship depends on it, right?

193
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,040
Yeah...

194
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,720
that's actually why I wanted to talk to you. You heard news?

195
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah.

196
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,700
So what news?

197
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,180
They want us to come in for another interview?

198
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,550
No.

199
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,250
Since we hadn't heard anything,

200
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,860
I- I called, and they said

201
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,810
it's gonna be a couple weeks,

202
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,270
maybe a month till they finalize their decision.

203
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,190
A month?

204
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,040
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

205
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,570
No, it's-it's not suck to live with you.

206
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,680
It's been fun, but...

207
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,530
you know, I just want to be legal.

208
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,690
And you will be.

209
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,470
Absolutely.

210
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,500
In the meantime... Hmm?

211
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,000
You ever shot anyone?

212
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,960
No, get away.

213
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,460
Look, this needle isn't nearly as big as the one in your arm,

214
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,440
and that didn't hurt, did it? I don't want it.

215
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,860
They need to do it, Lue.

216
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,330
You'll only feel
a little pinch as we give you

217
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,940
the numbing medicine, and after that, you won't feel a thing.

218
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,400
No!

219
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,070
Lue, calm down. It's gonna be okay.

220
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,190
?????1

221
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,780
??????2

222
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,570
What's he saying? What's the problem? I don't know.

223
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,310
He's saying it's too late.

224
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,010
There's nothing we can do.
It's Hmong.

225
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,550
He doesn't speak Hmong.

226
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,360
<i>He's never even heard it.</i>
<i>It isn't him speaking.</i>

227
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,770
It's the Dab.
He's seizing!

228
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,430
Oh-! Oh, my God!
Need some Lorazepam in here!

229
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,560
Seizure rules out Hashimoto's.

230
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,710
Yeah, that's the issue, not that we have no rational explanation

231
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,160
<i>for how the patient spoke a language</i> <i>he's never even heard.</i>

232
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I've got one.

233
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,870
?????

234
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,820
It means "you're a bunch of pathetic idiots" in Hmong.

235
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,810
Or it doesn't.

236
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,880
But you wouldn't know because none of you speak Hmong.

237
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,870
Kid, on the other hand, is presumably fluent in gibberish.

238
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,410
The grandfather speaks Hmong. He translated.

239
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,000
He heard what he wanted to hear, 'cause if his grandson really is possessed,

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,470
that means his son really is possessed,

241
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,840
which is a giant step up from being a sledgehammering psychopath.

242
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,180
Whatever it was preceded a seizure. It's obviously a neurological symptom.

243
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,070
Scleroderma, advanced to the point that it's affecting his brain?

244
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,000
Interesting.
So we should start treating-

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,110
Interesting that you keep
falling for it when I say "interesting. "

246
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,170
The scleroderma part was idiotic- we'd have seen skin involvement.

247
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,030
The interesting part is that you and Park agree,

248
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,310
but you're not able to look at each other.

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,350
Um... I'm looking at her.

250
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,490
I'm looking at him.

251
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,240
Good, now lick your lips.

252
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,000
Rasmussen's encephalitis.

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,520
Diffuse spotty inflammation could hit the autonomic centers of the brain.

254
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,660
???

255
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,730
It's Hmong for "get an MRI to confirm. "

256
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,120
Rasmussen's encephalitis.

257
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,790
But he'll be okay?

258
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,450
With treatment, it's manageable.

259
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,510
And it explains all the things that have happened to him?

260
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,890
We think so.
You are wrong.

261
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,740
And you are wasting my grandson's time.

262
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,660
Neurological issues can cause a person
to speak in tongues, speak with an accent-

263
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,540
He wasn't speaking in tongues!

264
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,420
In times of stress, our senses can fool us into believing-

265
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,550
I know the difference between science and faith,

266
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,920
and when my son started having the same dreams

267
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,530
my grandson is having, science couldn't help him.

268
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,190
I'm sorry if your son suffered from mental illness.

269
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,140
Kao was not crazy.

270
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,240
He was bright, caring, happy,

271
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
until the bad dreams came.

272
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,200
I don't want to watch it happen again.

273
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,230
Please don't scare the boy.

274
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,510
It won't help him get better.

275
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,640
<i>Axial view of mid-brain level looks good.</i>

276
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,820
Moving on to thalamic.

277
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,710
I had another dream last night.

278
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,450
This time it was about you. Really?

279
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,550
See, that's how you're supposed to react.

280
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,620
When a woman tells you she's dreamt about you, you should be thrilled,

281
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,990
even if you're not interested in her whatsoever. You're an idiot, you know that?

282
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,070
Well, I definitely won't be dreaming about you tonight.

283
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm jealous of you two.
<i>You couldn't be more different,</i>

284
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,170
<i>and yet you have this good thing happening.</i>

285
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,880
You support each other. You like each other.

286
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,860
Don't let House screw it up.

287
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,370
<i>We're not that different.</i>

288
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,910
Yeah, you are.

289
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,780
Apparently, there are some things about you
I don't know.

290
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,810
I served one year in police unit.

291
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,150
And you're just telling your husband now?

292
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,810
Immigration doesn't know.
No need for husband to know.

293
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,800
What is happening to boy with demons?

294
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,360
Absence of evidence on an MRI,

295
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,470
which my team has mistaken for evidence of absence.

296
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,290
This is what I am not understanding:

297
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,530
How can you believe in dark matters but not in dark spirits?

298
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,000
Is-is the idea of demons

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,180
so different than the higgs boson?

300
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,750
We can't see it, but we can see
the impact of its presence.

301
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,910
I borrowed your physics book.

302
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,200
I read while in bathroom.

303
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,670
You're a dead-eye shot and enjoy reading quantum physics

304
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,420
on the crapper? I read in bathtub.

305
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,390
Better image.

306
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,960
Thank you.

307
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,810
The doctors say my brain is sick.

308
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,880
Your doctors are trying their best, but they're not looking in the right place.

309
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,500
You know, I know this is a lot to put on an eight-year-old,

310
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,820
but you have angered our ancestors
by ignoring them.

311
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,450
Now do you remember how to talk to them?

312
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,330
Yeah, that's right.
Good.

313
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,000
Now close your eyes,

314
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,180
and we will ask for forgiveness together.

315
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,850
You're doing good...

316
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,950
But we have to do more.

317
00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,800
The evil spirits are in the air, and the only way to stop them

318
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,910
is by stopping the air.

319
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,430
You have to be brave. I'm not trying to hurt you.

320
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,090
This will help you.

321
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,310
I know it will.

322
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,100
<i>Lue?</i>
You okay?

323
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,910
I can't wake him up!
Lue!

324
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,920
Lue, you're safe. You're in the hospital.

325
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,850
Get grandpa away!

326
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,400
He's not here, honey. It was just a dream.
He was choking me!

327
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,220
No, Lue, it wasn't real. It was! He grabbed my neck!

328
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,210
Those bruises weren't there before.

329
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,980
He had the dream, and then he had the bruising.

330
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,640
<i>More likely-</i> and by "likely," I mean "rationally"-

331
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,110
it's the other way around.

332
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,920
His brain felt the pain in his neck

333
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,370
and created the dream to explain it.

334
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,750
Coagulopathy.
Lung problems cause a clotting disturbance.

335
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,140
He would have bruises everywhere.

336
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,320
Is it really preposterous that dreams can have physical manifestations?

337
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,300
Well, short answer is-

338
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,870
Thoughts during sleep can and do cause physical changes.

339
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,290
Is that right, Dr. Park?

340
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,170
<i>Did you wake up this morning</i> experiencing physical changes?

341
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,520
It's medically relevant. Her dream doesn't mean anything.

342
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,290
Can we start acting like it doesn't mean anything?
<i>Sure.</i>

343
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,880
We could also start acting like walls

344
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,420
don't mean anything,
but then we'd hurt our noses.

345
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,680
<i>You've been taking the high road.</i>

346
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,510
You haven't been teasing in an obviously teasable situation because you know it does mean something.

347
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,960
<i>She hates the dream because it makes her</i> feel vulnerable.

348
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,910
You love the dream because it makes you feel superior.

349
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,270
<i>The poor lass who can't help</i> <i>but fall sway to your charms,</i>

350
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,660
<i>and you're bestowing upon her</i> the gift of illusory irrelevance.

351
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,270
Can you please hint to House that you had a sex dream?

352
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,260
I'd really prefer not to get distracted with trying to cure the patient today.

353
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,920
I refuse to divulge my dreams about girl-on-girl loofa action.

354
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,990
<i>The bruising could indicate anemia,</i>

355
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,820
<i>a vitamin C deficiency, or even leukemia.</i>

356
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,750
That is so weird that you and I had the same dream.

357
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,710
<i>I assume yours also ends</i>

358
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,180
with me achieving ecstasy while simultaneously

359
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,640
placing third in the New York City marathon.
Third?

360
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,510
I'm a realist.

361
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,690
Liver failure can cause gibberish from encephalopathy,

362
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,820
constipation, bruising, and breathing problems.

363
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,500
Hepatic fibrosis could hit someone his age.

364
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,870
So let's hit his liver.

365
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,410
Get a biopsy.

366
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,630
Angle a bit more superiorly.

367
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,020
<i>He keeps having these nightmares</i>

368
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,090
that become real. They really hurt him.

369
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,650
I don't want to believe that a nightmare can do that, but I-

370
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,820
I'm struggling with it too, but these things can be explained medically.

371
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,080
But you haven't.

372
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,740
Every Doctor, <i>every idea they've had,</i>

373
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,620
it's been wrong.

374
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,180
Liver biopsy's back. Team's about to meet.

375
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,490
Back to avoiding eye contact with me?

376
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,310
House got to you again?

377
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,810
Want me to gaze longingly into your eyes
as I tell you the test results?

378
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,460
I want you to treat me like a friend,

379
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,160
which means getting over the fact that you like me more than I like you.

380
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,890
Yeah, egotism and preening really turn me on.

381
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,150
Too bad I'm not attracted to androgyny and self-pity,

382
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,490
or you'd have it made.

383
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,180
Because anyone who hasn't gotten wet from your petri dish of STDs

384
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,820
clearly has low self-esteem!

385
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,280
Bitch.

386
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,660
Dick!

387
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,780
You coming?

388
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,870
Why didn't your lips move when you said that?

389
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,710
<i>Chase!</i>

390
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,890
You coming?

391
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,720
Liver biopsy's back.

392
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,840
I'll be right there.

393
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,090
Biopsy was negative for fibrosis.

394
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,080
So once again, you don't know what's wrong?

395
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,010
It's always good to rule out the bad things.

396
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,510
<i>Doctors!</i>

397
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,060
God!

398
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,820
Was he?

399
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,640
Yes.

400
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,320
He was levitating. Cool.

401
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,480
So the one thing we know for sure is he was not levitating.

402
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,930
He was floating 6 inches off the bed.

403
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,040
He could've just been arching his back off the bed.

404
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,490
Yes, but then I would have come into the room and reported that the patient

405
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,060
was weirdly arching his back off the bed.

406
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,160
It was his whole body. He was levitating.

407
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,070
So many questions...

408
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,570
Starting with why did Chase address his comment

409
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,690
to someone who wasn't even in the room?

410
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,670
Hocus pocus,

411
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,400
on my feet you idiots must focus.

412
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,790
????

413
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,250
The kid's not a magician.

414
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,830
Of course not. He's the lovely assistant.

415
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,800
'Cause grandpa pig sticker is waving the wand.

416
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,460
Middling with...

417
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,850
is Chase trying to avoid Taub, or is he trying to prove

418
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,500
that he's not avoiding Park? <i>We checked the bed.</i>

419
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,630
There were no platforms or wires.
This wasn't a trick.

420
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,640
Tetanus could cause muscle rigidity.

421
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,040
<i>Maybe he was propped up by his heel and elbow.</i>
Except he wasn't!

422
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,850
<i>Tetanus wouldn't cause</i> that kind of breathing difficulty.

423
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,730
And ending with...
if Chase is trying not to avoid Park,

424
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,300
why is he doing this today and not yesterday?

425
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,840
But hypocalcemia could, <i>and the enema we administered</i>

426
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,360
<i>to cure his constipation</i> <i>had a high phosphorous load,</i>

427
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,210
which could make him transiently hypocalcemic.

428
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,740
It's a long shot, but at least it has the benefit of being rational.

429
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,110
Go pump up his electrolytes and start beta-blockers.

430
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,840
And good news for Park:

431
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,540
I think Chase had a sex dream about you.

432
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,710
Dreams don't mean anything.

433
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,820
<i>I don't know. Nothing you've done has helped.</i>

434
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,700
If we don't start and he has another seizure,

435
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,090
the neurological damage could be permanent.

436
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,210
My father-in-law-

437
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,960
he thinks the calling ceremony
didn't work because Lue wasn't there.

438
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,570
And you think he's right?

439
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,870
I don't know.

440
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,200
I'm sorry, but there's no way we can allow him to perform an exorcism

441
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,410
in your son's hospital room.

442
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,520
Then I will have to take him home.

443
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,620
A day ago, you were insulted
I'd even think you might believe that stuff,

444
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,030
<i>and now you're willing to stop all treatment,</i> <i>so you can try it?</i>

445
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,510
Maybe Xang was right about Kao.

446
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,180
The man I loved wasn't evil and would never do what he did.

447
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,050
He was... possessed.

448
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,700
And my son needs his soul back.

449
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,520
Why not?

450
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,250
<i>As long as he doesn't feed the kid anything</i>

451
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,840
or put anything on his skin that we haven't verified is harmless, what's the problem?

452
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,990
I agree.

453
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,030
And since we're establishing a new policy of "What the hell, we'll try anything,"

454
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,070
I'd like to hire Shakira to belly dance <i>while singing Waka Waka.</i>

455
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,220
As long as you get the mom and Shakira to consent.

456
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,020
<i>It's no different than having a priest</i> or rabbi lead a prayer vigil.

457
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,890
The mom is scared and confused

458
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,550
<i>and desperate for anything that'll give her hope.</i>

459
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,600
True.

460
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,760
But in the long run, I think you'll be happier having our lawyer declare her unfit.

461
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,900
That way you won't be ratifying superstition over science,

462
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,440
and I'll still be working here. And why would that make me happier?

463
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,850
You're not going anywhere, and we're not "ratifying" their beliefs,

464
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,300
we're respecting them.

465
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,870
You do realize it may involve animal sacrifice.

466
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,210
People who live in glass hospitals

467
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,410
should not throw exorcisms.

468
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,530
I'll talk to the mother.

469
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:22,250
I don't want to deny him the medicine, I just...

470
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,280
want to make sure I try everything I can.

471
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,670
I understand that,

472
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,870
but you have to understand that we're a hospital,

473
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,790
not a temple.

474
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,000
Then I'll take him elsewhere.
No, you won't.

475
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,620
<i>He's sick. We can't let him leave here.</i>

476
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,400
I'm sorry, you really have no choice.

477
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,340
I spoke to a lawyer.

478
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,440
He told me as long as I wasn't saying no

479
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,640
to your treatment, you couldn't say no

480
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,450
to my religion.

481
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,370
Give me 24 hours.

482
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,060
??????1

483
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,510
?????2

484
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,630
????3

485
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,940
This came in the mail today!

486
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,470
I'm sorry.

487
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,570
<i>I should've told you.</i> Told me what?

488
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,810
I don't understand.

489
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,560
What's the letter? It's from my Uncle in Poland.

490
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,690
My Aunt Luba, they put her in nursing home two months ago!

491
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,690
That's too bad.

492
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,110
My mother, I talk to her twice a week
and she never even mentioned it.

493
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,320
Wh-what does she think? That I can't handle?

494
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,530
I am 29 years old! I am not a child!

495
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,980
Were you going out tonight?

496
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,790
I could stay.

497
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,990
He's still barely breathing.

498
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,330
Lue?
How you feeling?

499
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,460
Any stronger?

500
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,020
Lue, can you hear me? 

501
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,930
What's wrong? I'm not sure.

502
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,180
Lue, I need you to squeeze my hand.

503
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,280
He's not responding. Get me an amp of D50!

504
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,590
You were wrong again?

505
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,950
I'm calling his grandfather.

506
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,630
<i>Genetic tests for Brugada and long QT variants</i>
<i>came back negative.</i>

507
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,160
What about a carotid aneurysm? <i>We should do an angiogram.</i>

508
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,400
He's got normal carotid pulses.
Who cares?

509
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,680
Mom's given up, why shouldn't I?

510
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,630
I'm sorry, do we not treat idiots? Because I thought-

511
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,980
<i>Her kid levitated.</i>

512
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,330
That happens to my girl, I'm expanding my diagnostic horizons.

513
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,600
All the more reason why we should shut down.

514
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,540
<i>We cure this kid now,</i> <i>crazy grandpa and his magic beads</i> get all the credit.

515
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,720
And since when do you care about credit?
Since when do I care about this kid?

516
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,180
All I care about is sending mommy

517
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,190
out into the world having faith in faith.

518
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,330
Kid's better off dead.

519
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,900
As soon as she's done appeasing the Gods, let's talk. What about Kawasaki?

520
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,050
<i>It explains the irregular heartbeat,</i> <i>respiratory distress, and seizures.</i>

521
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,560
It fits.

522
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,280
Which means he needs a coronary bypass.

523
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,840
<i>It can't be Kawasaki.</i>
Echo would have shown it.

524
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,190
But a patent ductus arteriosis-

525
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,330
it can't be a PDA. He's not an infant, nor has he had any symptoms for eight years.

526
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,940
Maybe he has. Maybe he had an infected ductus,

527
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,320
which we inadvertently treated with antibiotics.

528
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,810
So no evidence is evidence of evidence?

529
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,700
I'm just saying, it's consistent.
It's a billion-to-one.

530
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,450
Which means there's seven people in the world who fit the diagnosis.

531
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,170
I thought we were looking for 100.

532
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,650
Well, maybe PDA is more common than we thought.

533
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,290
With idiot doctors like you- You're wrong.

534
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,670
But the treatment's just ibuprofen. <i>Closes the malformed duct.</i>

535
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,580
Worst-case scenario, he just doesn't get better,

536
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,490
No, worst-case scenario is you piss me off-

537
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:15,820
You're not gonna let us save an eight-year-old because one more person might embrace religion?

538
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,320
Does anyone here think my diagnosis is right?

539
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,420
Well, then I have decided, for today only, to respect your opinions.

540
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,930
We will proceed according to your diagnosis

541
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,330
and nothing else.

542
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,490
That's an order.

543
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,530
Good luck.

544
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,660
We need to put him on the O.R. schedule.

545
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,170
<i>His B.P.'s dropping.</i> He's crashing. Call a code!

546
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,940
You need to stop this!

547
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,730
I'm giving him the ibuprofen.

548
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,130
Dinner's almost ready.

549
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,890
I think I'll stick with the fluids tonight, thanks.

550
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,360
Why are you sulking? I'm not sulking.

551
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,690
Oh, my mistake.

552
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,410
Either religion is killing a kid,

553
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,150
or I am.

554
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,090
What are you doing?

555
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,920
Comforting my husband after a bad day.

556
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,350
If this is not what you want, I go back to making dinner.

557
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,190
I'm not gonna answer that. Oh, smart man.

558
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,940
This is killing mood.

559
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,970
U.S. citizenship! I'll get it.

560
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,220
This is Mrs. House, please give good news, so my husband and I

561
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,950
can go back to sex.

562
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,960
<i>Budmo! Is fantastic!</i>

563
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,810
How many notices you send me?

564
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,980
O- okay, I-I come pick up naturalization certificate.

565
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,140
Thank you for calling.

566
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm sorry.

567
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,480
Dr. Adams, Dr. Taub?

568
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,880
His vitals are improving. He's stabilizing.

569
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,320
He's gonna be okay.

570
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,180
It worked.

571
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,410
Um, no, it didn't.

572
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,610
Mrs. Cheng, the medicine I administered

573
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,630
was a long-shot treatment for Lue's heart,

574
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,710
but that's what's helping him.

575
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,340
Ibuprofen?
That's for headaches.

576
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,110
I know it seems hard to believe, but it's true.

577
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,110
And I know this seems hard for you to believe.

578
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,710
Honey...

579
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,850
Grandpa was right. He saved you.

580
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,020
There were two things we thought were impossible.

581
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,650
One of them wasn't.

582
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,420
That's all we know.

583
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,430
 Was I good? Doesn't mean anything.

584
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,140
Idea got planted. It was probably inevitable.

585
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,950
It means something.

586
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,370
What?

587
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,730
Well, it could mean the obvious,
that you want some of this.

588
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,630
When will you learn that that look is insulting?

589
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,670
Or it could just mean that we like each other.

590
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,070
I'm weird, and you're pretty,

591
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,730
but we connect. We feel safe.

592
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,830
We trust each other.

593
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,770
Maybe.

594
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,360
Just testing my theory.

595
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,210
Adams defied me.

596
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,960
There's one more zealot in the world.

597
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,740
And Dominika moved out.

598
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,180
<i>She was fun. She was hot.</i>

599
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,040
<i>She fixed my blender.</i>

600
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,660
That is not a metaphor.

601
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,670
You know any good fake divorce lawyers?

602
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,720
I am surprisingly depressed by this.

603
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,250
I have cancer.

604
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,330
You were a little short with me the other day.

605
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,010
You do need an excuse. Cancer may be overplaying it.

606
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,240
Stage II Thymoma.

607
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,620
I didn't want to tell you until I had it confirmed.

608
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,510
I got the tests back this morning.

609
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,960
I have cancer, House.

610
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,270
