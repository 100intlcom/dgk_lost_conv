1
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,000
Good afternoon, Cedarville!

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,820
It is my distinct honor to present

3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,270
our annual community service award

4
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,110
to one of our most outstanding citizens.

5
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,380
Now, many of you may recognize him

6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,950
as coach Bob of our champion little league team.

7
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,740
And some of you may know him

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,370
as the treasurer of our harvest scholarship fund.

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,860
<i>But I know that all of you know him as the guy</i>

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,810
that owns the only gas station in town.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,690
<i>Bob Harris, get on up here</i> <i>with that beautiful family of yours!</i>

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,920
Bob Harris, folks!

13
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,640
Bob, your community activism,

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,810
<i>charity work,</i>

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,820
and character represent the finest Cedarville has to offer.

16
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,790
<i>Please accept this on behalf of all of us</i>

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,130
and know that we love you.

18
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,280
Are you all right?

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,990
<i>Bob?</i>

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,370
You're crushing me!

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,330
Wake up!

22
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,250
I think you're having a heart attack.

23
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm gonna call the ambulance!

24
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,970
No. Just drive me to the hospital.

25
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:24,720

28
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,220
as the new dean of medicine,

29
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,560
I'd like to personally welcome all of our new employees

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,280
and ask, why the hell do you want to come back?

31
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,680
Tired of surfing. He hasn't changed.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,420
And neither has the job, right?
We still get to do crazy crap?

33
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,300
Save people's lives instead of just their noses?

34
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,090
About that... About the crazy stuff?

35
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,540
<i> Here we go.</i> He's gone from ally to enemy.

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,530
He has no choice. He's the boss now.

37
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,970
He has to be professional. He has to base his decisions

38
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,230
on what's best for the entire hospital. <i>We can't take it personally.</i>

39
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,180
Couldn't have said it better myself.
<i>You did.</i>

40
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,570
I'm just reading the notes on your desk.

41
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,780
He also wants us to spy for him. <i>Not spy.</i>

42
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,780
I'm trying to keep House out of prison.
To do that, I need to know what he's doing and planning.

43
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,650
Spy. Spy.

44
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,760
Come on, guys. I am your boss.

45
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,270
You do have to treat me appropriately.

46
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,360
But it doesn't have to be awkward and weird.

47
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,780
Outside of work, I still consider us all friends.

48
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,960
<i>I'm glad you feel that way,</i> because I do have a favor to ask.

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,450
I told House I couldn't come back until next week.
He said he understood completely and that I was fired.

50
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,660
So...

51
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,270
Since I have my kids for the next two days,

52
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,750
I need a babysitter. No!

53
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,000
 Male patient went into v-fib

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,990
but shows no signs of heart disease????

55
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,010
 What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?

56
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,940
He said he was at work.

57
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,490
You're late. According to my calendar, I'm a week early.

58
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,720
Beard's a nice touch.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,570
<i>Lets everyone know that you're not a teenage girl.</i>

60
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,260
Oh, now, you two make a cute couple.

61
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,050
And you two...

62
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,990
It's not important. Dr. Park.

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,200
You're a lot taller than I thought you'd be.

64
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,600
And I look forward to working with you as well.
He's lying, not just Taub... the patient.

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>These abrasions on his knees...</i>

66
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,800
they're minty fresh... About ten hours old.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,600
He got them playing flag football.
He said he got them playing flag football.

68
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,360
I'm sure that's true if "flag" is a euphemism for "penis"

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,970
and "football" is a euphemism for "entering a vagina."

70
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,270
Why lie about it?
Everybody lies.

71
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,770
<i>Speaking of which,</i> how are your two baby girls?

72
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,230
Wow, twins... congratulations.

73
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,210
Awkward!

74
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,210
He knocked up two different women at the same time...
<i>At least he thinks he did.</i>

75
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,150
You have them DNA tested yet? Why would I?

76
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,270
They look just like me. But they will grow.

77
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,810
<i>Find out what else he's lying about.</i> Do an exercise test...

78
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,110
see if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.
But we could end up causing another cardiac arrest.

79
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,910
Hopefully. Then we'll know what set it off.

80
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,140
<i>He means it's better to do it here</i> where we can revive him

81
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
than have it happen somewhere else.

82
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,790
The prodigal son has returned.

83
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,280
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go slaughter a fatted calf for lunch.

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,860
I told you, I was sitting at my desk when the attack happened.

85
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,200
These rug burns are from last night.

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,540
We think you were having sex, but memory loss could also be a symptom.

87
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,770
Maybe we should ask your wife.

88
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,090
Don't.

89
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,930
I-I did something stupid last night,

90
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,470
but it was a one-time thing.

91
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,860
You have no idea how bad I feel about it.

92
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,060
<i>Your guilt is between you and your wife.</i>

93
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,310
We just need to know what happened.

94
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,190
I was having sex at a motel <i>when I started to feel light-headed.</i>

95
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,620
<i>Next thing I knew, I was laying on my back.</i>

96
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,550
I could barely breathe.

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,810
Is everything all right? We'd like to perform an exercise test,

98
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,910
re-create the stress that may have caused his symptoms.

99
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,390
He was sitting at his desk. <i>It's his heart we're worried about.</i>

100
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,380
The test will monitor its rhythm so we can check foany abnormalities.

101
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
I spent a month in solitary.
You don't think I can keep this up all day?

102
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,710
I have a headache. Could you just lower your voice?

103
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,290
Chase and Taub are back!

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,370
You want me to pick up an ice-cream cake?

105
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,840
I also think that Taub has brought

106
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,640
his little taubettes into work with him today.
Why would he do that?

107
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,750
Because I didn'tive him time to do anything else.
<i>Then I started wondering,</i>

108
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,850
who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?

109
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,910
They're not here.

110
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,010
What?

111
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,830
I just came for a chat with a friend.

112
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,550
What's that I smell, friiend?

113
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,870
Understand your confusion.

114
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,260
I was eating a baby for lunch, <i>and...</i>

115
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,950
<i>I have a massive migraine.</i>
Will you please just go away?

116
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,600
You should probably lie down and rest.

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,450
Yeah. I was trying to.

118
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,340
Oh! There is one more thing.

119
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,420
He's in togood of shape.

120
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,210
We need to get him to the point he was at last night.

121
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,590
Well, don't look at me.

122
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,410
<i>But if you want to...</i>
Cute.

123
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,700
But I didn't mean physical stress.

124
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,990
<i>Don't you guys think this is irresponsible?</i>

125
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,290
It's like you getting two women pregnant at the same time.

126
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,890
I just mean the part about the odds of it happening.

127
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,530
They had to be incredibly high. <i>And if we induce v-fib,</i>

128
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,040
odds say that we'll be able to revive him.
But there's always a chance we can't.

129
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,010
It's extreme and reckless. That's House.
You get used to it.

130
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,290
Or I fire you.

131
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,300
Look what I found... Kiddie-winkies!

132
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,910
I wonder who they belong to. Give me my kids.

133
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,200
No. I genuinely wonder who they belong to. I need a DNA sample.

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm not letting you DNA test my kids.

135
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,200
Already did. This swab's for you.

136
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,650
Fine. If you don't mind paying a fortune in child support

137
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,170
for some other guy's kids, no skin cells off my cheek.

138
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,530
<i> His heart rate's finally elevating.</i>

139
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,220
Dr. Chase said you had something to tell me.

140
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,920
We were talking about how you got the abrasions
<i>on your knees... the flag football game.</i>

141
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,490
Yeah, honey, I'm gonna need you to let the guys know

142
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,900
I'm not gonna be able to play on Saturday.
The whole town knows that you're in the hospital.

143
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,840
I wouldn't worry about it.
That's not what you wanted to tell her.

144
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,660
You said the game wasn't typical.

145
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,160
<i>Something happened that you were upset about?</i>

146
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,610
I don't understand. What are you...

147
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,690
I don't f... I don't feel very w...

148
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,630
<i>What's happening?</i>

149
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,950
It's not his heart.
I know.

150
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,940
He's having a seizure.

151
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,790
There wasn't any abnormal electrical activity
in his E.K.G. when his seizure occurred.

152
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,590
It wasn't caused by a v-fib.

153
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,940
We still can't rule it out.
His E.K.G. from the E.R. documented...

154
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,080
<i> Myocarditis...</i>

155
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,630
viral infection weakening the wall muscles.
<i>We need to biopsy his heart to confirm.</i>

156
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,000
Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
Could be genetic... Brugada Syndrome.

158
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,590
Oh, my God.

159
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,880
Two prodigal sons.
Come on. Let's hug it out.

160
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,320
You really like the idea,
<i>or you just want to grab some hair for a DNA test? It's a stupid idea.</i>

161
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,550
We would have seen evidence of brugada in the E.K.G.

162
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,910
You know, this is...
This is just messing with my feng shui here.

163
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,290
What about over there? A pheochromocytoma.

164
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,290
Excess adrenaline can cause heart problems

165
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,010
and... seizures.

166
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,420
Boring! I'm sorry.

167
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,540
I thought I was here to treat the patients, not entertain you.

168
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,970
Would it hurt to do both?

169
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,880
Oh, this is much better!
I said it was boring.

170
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,210
I didn't say it was wrong. So I'm right.

171
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,540
<i>Nope. You're wrong. Photic epilepsy...</i>

172
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,200
it's equally boring,
but it has the advantage of possibly being right.

173
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,080
<i>Give him an E.E.G. to confirm.</i>

174
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,450
<i>If you ever hear me mention</i> anything about wanting kids,

175
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,990
please feel free to punch me in the liver.

176
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,150
<i>Why?</i>

177
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,480
It's like Satan's alarm clock.

178
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,620
What's House up to? He hasn't asked me for anything.

179
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,970
He's been incredibly well-behaved.

180
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,310
He's doing his clinic hours.

181
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,280
That is a sign of concern.
And you know him as well as I do.

182
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,250
He needs to constantly establish he's the Alpha dog.

183
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,090
He's got his team back. He's got his office back.
He's got everything he needs.

184
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,290
You really believe that... he's content?

185
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,490
I don't want to let House sabotage himself by sabotaging me,

186
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,070
and I need your guidance and your trust to do that.

187
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,940
 No, no, no.

188
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,680
Cuddy had a problem with House, she came to me.
Wanted to vent... me.

189
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,260
How did that turn out?

190
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,380
You have a problem with House, deal with it, or find someone else who can.

191
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,980
<i>I'm sorry about earlier,</i> but we needed to provoke a reaction.

192
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,410
It worked.

193
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,850
I can barely look her in the eyes anymore.

194
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,820
I'd want my husband to tell me the truth.

195
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,910
Sure.

196
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,280
<i>You'll feel better, and she'll feel what...</i>
<i>devastated, betrayed?</i>

197
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,670
Heartbroken.

198
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,270
Do you really want to do that to her?

199
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,480
No.

200
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,720
But I can't live like this.

201
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,640
But she can.
<i>All set.</i>

202
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,120
All right, we need you to sit back and try to relax.

203
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,820
Just look at the light.

204
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,790
What exactly are they building back there?

205
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,650
A dream.

206
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,400
The E.E.G. didn't show any abnormal brain activity.

207
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,840
He doesn't have photic epilepsy.

208
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,850
I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma.
You said I was wrong.

209
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,110
You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first.

210
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,680
<i>That only takes a couple of hours.</i>

211
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,900
<i>Finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system</i>
<i>is gonna take all night.</i>

212
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,920
Monitor his brain activity, start a continuous urineest
<i>and blood draws every two hours.</i>

213
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,580
I can't! I have my kids!
Wilson's leaving in, like, minutes!

214
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,580
Chase and Adams can do the test. Thank you.

215
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,570
For the massage bed.

216
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,090
You and Park are checking the motel

217
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,430
he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.

218
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,790
He couldn't find a babysitter. Get over it.

219
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,970
You're gonna get us killed. She thinks I'm a prostitute on her turf.

220
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,850
Showing weakness is what gets you killed.

221
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,400
Why would she think you're a prostitute?
I'm in a dump with a guy almost twice my age.

222
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,940
What else is she gonna think?
How old do you think I am?

223
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,930
So who cheated on you?

224
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,400
We just met.
Don't you think it's a little early

225
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,220
to be dragging up our baggage in front of each other?

226
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,610
Who says I have baggage?

227
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,150
I know when House went to prison, you quit medicine.

228
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,020
- You don't do that unless... - I didn't quit.

229
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,630
I took a vacation.
I knew when he got out, I'd get my job back.

230
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,450
House didn't even know he was coming back.

231
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,710
I had faith.

232
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,710
Now, that has baggage stamped all over it.

233
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,170
<i>Seizure activity?</i>

234
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,620
No. One of the sensors came loose.

235
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,020
I'll fix it.

236
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,540
 What is it?

237
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,050
Not a Pheochromocytoma.

238
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,200
Our patient now has a mass in his neck,

239
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,070
and his body temp's been rising over the last three hours.
Where is the construction crew?

240
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,560
<i>Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night.</i>

241
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,350
So I chose night.
And his urine and blood tests

242
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,460
didn't show any evidence of an adrenaline-secreting tumor.

243
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,540
Meningitis. We can do a lumbar puncture to confirm.

244
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,570
Sorry. I had to drop my kids off <i>at day care across town.</i>

245
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,080
What'd I miss? It's not meningitis.

246
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,900
His neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.

247
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,870
<i> He's only guessing.</i>
I'm talking to Taub.

248
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,990
He can't say "my kids" until he lets me test them.

249
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,980
<i>Tell me about the love shack</i> <i>where he cheated on his bride.</i>

250
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,550
Quarters came in handy.
<i>My kids loved the massage bed.</i>

251
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,600
Lab tests show the bed tested positive for, uh,

252
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,000
semen, vaginal secretions,

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,310
<i>saliva, and fecal matter,</i>

254
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,990
both human and animal.

255
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,660
<i>Probably want to boil the kids</i> for a couple hours when you get home.

256
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,530
<i>Thbathroom also tested positive</i>
for five different types of pathogenic bacteria.

257
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:49,450
Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them.
Yeah. How'd you know? The bulge in his neck.

258
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,330
Bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space,

259
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,240
moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus...

260
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,200
<i>Lemierre's Syndrome.</i>

261
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,550
<i>Treat with Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid.</i>

262
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,030
Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.

263
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,470
You got at least a trillion cells.

264
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,840
You're gonna misplace one of them eventually.

265
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,430
I have to tell my wife the truth.

266
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,950
There's plenty of time for that after the operation.

267
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,640
What if I die, and one day she finds out I cheated on her?

268
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,410
I'll never be able to explain, never tell her how sorry I am.

269
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,370
<i>You're increasing the odds of that</i> every second we waste here.

270
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,810
No, I'm not agreeing to anything until I talk to her.

271
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,830
<i>Daddy!</i>

272
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,740
Hey, guys.

273
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,830
Your neck looks really gross.

274
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,830
I missed you both so much.
But I need to ask you favor.

275
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,840
I need to talk to mommy alone for a second.

276
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,480
Would you mind watching them for us?

277
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,490
This guy's an idiot.
I think he actually has a good point.

278
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,580
What would you think if you found out years later
your beloved dead wife cheated on you?

279
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,120
I wouldn't believe it.

280
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,640
As long as I don't hear it directly from her,

281
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,670
then I can hang on to hope that it's not true.

282
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,170
But this way...

283
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,920
She has to either dump him or forgive him.

284
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,010
Guys, get your stuff. We're leaving.

285
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,960
I'm so sorry. I'll be back.

286
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,790
I'm gonna drop our kids off at my mother's.

287
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,550
Look, he made a mistake...

288
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,930
A stupid, horrible mistake.

289
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,390
But we'll get through this.

290
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,560
All I care about right now is that my husband gets better.

291
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,700
Sorry about yesterday.

292
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,380
<i>House was like the child catcher from chitty chitty bang bang.</i>

293
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,390
Why is he so obsessed with my kids being my kids?

294
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,610
Because he sees insecurity,

295
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,750
and when House senses weakness, he pounces,
and because his insecurity

296
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,520
is the fact that other people can have faith

297
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,360
and don't have the obsessive need for physical proof.

298
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,860
Also, he started a betting pool

299
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,780
on which kid is yours and which isn't.

300
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,660
An entire hospital betting on the legitimacy of my kids?

301
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,910
It's great to be back among friends.

302
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,420
I'm not the bad guy here.

303
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,780
I'm betting on them both being yours.

304
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,800
I would have donated the money to charity.

305
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,170
 Approaching the clot.

306
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,430
Stand by for...

307
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,890
It's not a clot.

308
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,160
It's his lymph nodes.
The bulge wasn't caused by pus or blood.

309
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,690
It's tissue inflammation.

310
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,380
How can there be that much tissue... lymphoma.

311
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,590
We need to take a biopsy.

312
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,830
Did I nick something?
I don't know. I don't see any bleeding in here.

313
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,130
His sclera's jaundiced.
I think it's his liver. It's failing.

314
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,600
We did a major operation for no reason. It's not Lemierre's Syndrome.

315
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,810
We would have had to biopsy his lymph nodes anyway to check for cancer.

316
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,090
Which it's not. Biopsy was clean.

317
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,080
We could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal.

318
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,790
<i>It explains his heart, seizures,</i> and liver failing.

319
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,440
<i> But not his swollen lymph notes.</i>

320
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,360
Why are we stealing cable from here? We don't even have a tv in our office.

321
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,010
I'm an ex-con trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by.

322
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,010
Stealing's all I know...

323
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,880
that and the fact that I was right about what's wrong with our patient.

324
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,280
Just wrong about what?

325
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,010
He means it's not lemierre's, but it's still an infection,

326
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,680
which is why it's spreading so rapidly.

327
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,000
Cultures take time, and his liver doesn't have much left.

328
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,760
That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

329
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,450
The blast will fry what's left of his liver. The cure will kill him.

330
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,230
Not if we get him a liver transplant first and then treat him with a broad spectrum.

331
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,650
And old team for the win!

332
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,650
Not that I'm keeping score. <i>It's more of a grid</i>

333
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,990
where I assign numerical values

334
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,080
to determine who gets raises, vacation time,

335
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,470
and my respect.

336
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,080
 We he him on the donor list for a liver.
But these things take time.

337
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,520
So he could die before he gets one.

338
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,280
<i>It's a possibility. But we have another option.</i>

339
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,520
We can do a partial liver transplant from a living donor.

340
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,680
I'll do it.

341
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,850
 If you're a match, but to increase our odds,

342
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,000
we'd like to get your friends and faly tested as well.

343
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,930
Is it safe?

344
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,310
It's a major surgery.

345
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,860
The donor spends a week in the hospita

346
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,020
<i>and up to three months convalescing at home.</i> I can't ask someone to do that for me.

347
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,380
There are hundreds of people who would do that for you.

348
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,790
Because they don't know the real me.

349
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,120
You are a good man

350
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,240
who made a mistake.

351
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,080
Then I have to tell them first.

352
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,220
I have to live with this too.

353
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,070
I know.

354
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,680
And I'm sorry, but...

355
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,350
This is the only way that I can do this.

356
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,420
Before I ask any of you to sacrifice three months of your life for me,

357
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,240
I have a confession.

358
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,910
I had an affair.

359
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,940
I cheated on Denise.

360
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,200
I wouldn't blame anyone if you decide...
I forgive him.

361
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,790
That should be enough for all of us.

362
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,320
Thank you so much for coming here...

363
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,820
there's more.

364
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,230
Larry...

365
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,390
That new transmission I put in your truck... you didn't need it.

366
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,440
Joe, same thing with the engine rebuild.

367
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:59,350
In fact, I cheated most of you here tonight.
<i>Half the time you bring your cars</i>

368
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,370
into my garage, there's nothing wrong with them.

369
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,980
<i>I've been ripping you all off for years.</i>

370
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:13,530
I also took $10,000 from the harvest scholarship fund,

371
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,320
<i>and I lost it gambling.</i>

372
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,190
I'm sorry.

373
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,040
I'm not the man you thought I was.

374
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,430
That went over well.

375
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,730
Out of the two donors who didn't walk out,

376
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,370
both were negative for a potential match.

377
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,330
Telling the truth may have just killed this guy.

378
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,970
I told him to tell his wife he cheated, not confess every sin he's ever committed.

379
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,480
If everyone did that, we'd never find a donor for anyone again.

380
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,370
Everybody doesn't lie, cheat, or steal from their friends. Yeah, they do.

381
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,360
Maybe not as much as this guy, <i>but if people told nothing but the truth,</i>

382
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,830
the world would probably burn down overnight.

383
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,990
Some people think it's burning now. Maybe if everybody didn't lie...

384
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,690
<i>Aw, that is cute.</i>

385
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,770
I'm talking about your breasts.

386
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,520
<i>They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest.</i>

387
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,330
Truth.

388
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,460
<i>It's uncomfortable, isn't it?</i>

389
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,420
More truth... I only noticed because Chase was staring at them.

390
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,910
He'd never admit it, because he doesn't want to offend you.

391
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,780
Same reason he'd never tell you that he's thought about having sex with you.

392
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,400
<i>Although, to be fair, every man you've ever met</i>
has thought about having sex with you.

393
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,890
They'll lie, because if you knew...

394
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,060
You probably wouldn't want to have sex with them.

395
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,300
And that's just some of the lies from the last minute.

396
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,740
And here's a bigger one...

397
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,470
you already kn this, but you pretend you don't

398
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,890
because it makes you feel civilized.

399
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,950
Most people find it easier to ignore the truth.

400
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,780
Ask Taub.

401
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,510
Our patient can't wait for a transplant that's never gonna come.

402
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,700
We need to get reckless and extreme.

403
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,210
<i>C.T. his liver, find the damaged area,</i> <i>and cut it out.</i>

404
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,620
Hopefully, what's left will be enough

405
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,940
so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

406
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,340
I'm sorry the first time I had both of you together

407
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,850
I had to wk.

408
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,520
But daddy's boss is what we call a jackass.

409
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,960
Good. Stay right there.

410
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,570
 I'm also sorry...

411
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,440
For what I'm about to do...

412
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,120
Because...

413
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,040
Because nothing will ever change how I feel about you guys.

414
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,060
But...

415
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,750
But daddy is weak and needs to know.

416
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,450
Okay.

417
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,280
Just gonna put this right here...Okay?

418
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
It's 3:30 in the morning. Why are you still here?

419
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,890
House is here

420
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,350
and apparently prepping for an operation

421
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,620
that will probably kill a patient.

422
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,620
I wouldn't be doing this if I thought there was another way.

423
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,300
There is. He needs a transplant. You have one lying around?

424
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,740
'Cause he'll be dead if he doesn't get one in the next few hours.

425
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,410
That falls under natural causes. If you kill him, we're looking at... dead is dead.

426
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,930
Not as far as our lawyers are concerned.

427
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,320
I'm not being a dick. This is a real issue,

428
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
and I have to worry about the big picture now.

429
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,580
I don't.

430
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,610
I'll be doing what you would have done a year ago.

431
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,490
I'll be in surgery.

432
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,960
<i>Chase...</i>

433
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,970
You need to check this out.

434
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,160
This is a C.T. scan of his liver

435
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,900
<i>from ten hours ago...</i>

436
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,350
This is from now. It's healing itself.

437
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,680
<i>When I left the room,</i>

438
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,460
he was telling her about the strippers from his bachelor party.

439
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,670
Liver function has improved 30%...

440
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,420
<i>buys us a few extra days before he'll need a transplant.</i>

441
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,530
Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?

442
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,590
And scene.

443
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,980
Now we're back to boring reality reality.

444
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,700
His liver was in shock before.
He's been having an allergic reaction since he got here.

445
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,650
Could explain why his symptoms appeared so rapidly.

446
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,750
And maybe starting to go away.
We need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.

447
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,900
Or who. This all started when he cheated on his wife.

448
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,410
He's allergic to a person?

449
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,500
Or something she's wearing...

450
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,060
makeup, perfume,

451
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,530
birth control method, her "Hello Kitty" doll.

452
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,590
Two of you go find her and find out what.

453
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,570
Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids

454
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,820
and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.

455
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,170
You think I did this to him?

456
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,310
Or something you wear, own, use, or gave him.

457
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,450
I gave him a condom. He didn't have one. What kind? I don't know what kind.

458
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,300
I got it from the health fair I was working at.

459
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,210
You're in the medical profession? I'm Miss Cedarville.

460
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,090
The health fair is one of my responsibilities.

461
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,960
Is another one hooking up with 38-year-old married men?

462
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,410
I guess I'm supposed to be the good cop.

463
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,200
I know this is tough.

464
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,520
But anything you can remember might help save his life.

465
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,370
He was giving me a ride home, and...

466
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,050
He always seemed so nice.

467
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,780
And then we ended up at the motel.

468
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,500
And now everybody's talking about it. And if they find out it was me,

469
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,690
I'm gonna lose my title and probably my job.

470
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,720
And no one in town is ever gonna speak to me again.

471
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,850
<i>I made a mistake,</i> <i>and now it's gonna end up ruining my life.</i>

472
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,950
Denise never wants to see me again.

473
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,410
What did you think was gonna happen?

474
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,080
I was sick of living a lie.

475
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,210
Everybody loved me. Everybody looked up to me.

476
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,590
But...

477
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,120
I didn't deserve it. Everybody makes mistakes.

478
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,070
They just don't usually broadcast all of them at the same time.

479
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,400
Well, if I'm gonna die, I might as well do it with a clean soul.

480
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,180
And if you live?

481
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,330
You didn't just burn bridges. You torched, nuked, and salted the earth with them.

482
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,110
Everybody has to pay for their sins.

483
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,230
 Oh, it feels like you stuck me with a hot poker.

484
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,600
An allergic reaction. It's the swab for wheat-based allergies.

485
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,270
I've been eating wheat my entire life. I'm not allergic to wheat.

486
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,060
Now it feels like my whole body's on fire.

487
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,630
This doesn't make any sense.

488
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,580
He broke out with a rash right after I tested with the wheat-allergy swab,

489
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,280
but none of his blood samples show he's allergic to it.

490
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,410
Then he's not allergic to it. Could the corticosteroids have somehow caused it?

491
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,590
I didn't hook them up yet. After he broke out,

492
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,400
I wanted to confirm it was gluten before we dosed him.

493
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,970
Could be a latex allergy.

494
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,950
Started with a condom, and we kept it going with our gloves and equipment.

495
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,060
He doesn't test positive for that either. None of his samples test positive for anything.

496
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,620
Then he's allergic to something not on the tests.

497
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,950
<i>I'll keep looking here.</i>
We'll start the steroids and see if it clears up.

498
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,450
You have one patient and three DNA results?

499
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,540
How else do I compare them to other genetic disorders?

500
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,670
What's up? Chase basically called me a sellout.

501
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,060
Just because you hung up your lab coat for more money

502
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,840
and a bigger office?

503
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,420
I hung it up because someone had to run this place after cuddy left.

504
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,810
There are a lot of good administrators out there, not many good doctors.

505
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,280
More to it than you think.

506
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,870
For example, you're looking at monkey DNA.

507
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,280
My analysis...

508
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,110
House took your results after he manipulated you into providing them.

509
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,230
He's shedding his skin like a snake.

510
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,180
If it was an allergic reaction, the Corticosteroids and Epinephrine

511
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,680
<i>would have made him better, not worse.</i>

512
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,080
Is everyone trying to think of an answer?

513
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,300
Or is everyone afraid to say what they think the answer is?

514
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,590
I take it you're in the latter category.

515
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,620
Stevens-Johnson syndrome...

516
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,780
<i>it fits all of his symptoms and exains</i> <i>why he got worse after the steroids.</i>

517
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,510
Most medication exacerbates the condition.

518
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,410
There's no treatment for it.

519
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,900
It fits.

520
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,840
<i>Case closed.</i>

521
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,160
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

522
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,520
I feel like I'm in hell.

523
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,320
We can't give you too much pain medication, or we'll make your condition worse.

524
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,180
I got one final confession to make.

525
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,670
What's left...

526
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,780
you cheated on your taxes?

527
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,610
I'm a murderer.

528
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,650
<i>I killed my business partner.</i>

529
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,340
I shot him in the head.

530
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,320
I made it look like suicide.

531
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,410
<i>And he was just the first.</i>

532
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,670
You killed more?

533
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,890
Three...

534
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,680
Or four.

535
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,100
Try not to kill anyone else until I get back.

536
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,080
 It's neurological.

537
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,510
There's an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery of his brain...

538
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,860
the area moderating impulse control and compulsion.

539
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,870
<i>As it grew larger,</i> so did the confessions.

540
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,440
Watch.

541
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,640
Bob, one of my shoes is missing from my locker.

542
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,220
I'm so sorry.

543
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,080
<i>I... I needed the cash, and, um,</i> <i>the locker was open.</i>

544
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,580
I never heard of a neurological problem that causes someone's skin to fall off.

545
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,200
Because there isn't one.

546
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:56,320
The aneurysm is just another symptom. <i>It's not the cause.</i>

547
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,230
You add them all together, we get...

548
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,390
We get Kaw... Kawas...

549
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,650
<i>Kawas...</i>

550
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,650
It's Kawasaki's Disease. It's autoimmune.

551
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,130
Yes, we knew what "kawah" meant.

552
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,410
We just figured since it basically presents only in Asian children...

553
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,080
which you might have, by the way.

554
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,290
Which is basically why we missed it. Rug burns...

555
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,590
<i>certain carpet-cleaning chemicals</i> <i>have been linked to it.</i>

556
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,250
Start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Monitor the aneurysm.

557
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,880
If it doesn't resolve itself, we'll have to repair it.
The rest of you...

558
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,380
Aren't surfing enough.

559
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,820
Monkey DNA... nice touch. Really?

560
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,880
You don't think I should have gone with rat?

561
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,810
I've been second-guessing myself all day. Where are the DNA results?

562
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,990
First admit that I was right.

563
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,330
You manipulated me into doing it. Yeah, I'll admit to that.

564
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,200
Now you admit that it was incredibly easy,

565
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,390
because you can't cheat an honest man. I love them.

566
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't care if one of them isn't biologically mine.

567
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,790
What about both? Could be. Haven't read these.

568
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,250
Now say I was right.

569
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,830
No. I'll admit I was weak for a moment,

570
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,190
but I'm not doing this. I don't care.

571
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,010
You do, and I'll prove it.

572
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,500
I will shred this.

573
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,640
I will call off my pool, return the money, and we'll forget all about it.

574
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,070
Or we'll go to the light box in the lab

575
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,760
and know the truth once and for all.

576
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,870
Stop.

577
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,700
Let me see them.

578
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,010
Just wanted to make sure all three were inside.

579
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,380
<i>The mayor checked.</i>

580
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,630
There wasn't any money missing from the scholarship fund.

581
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,160
Dr. Chase told me... About your disease,

582
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,640
how it made you confess to crimes you hadn't committed.

583
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,830
The affair with that girl...

584
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,620
Is that real?

585
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,340
Honey, I...

586
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,470
Would never...

587
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,470
Have never cheated on you.

588
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,410
I knew you could never do that to me.

589
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,670
I don't know how... But I knew.

590
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,010
Glad to see taking a year off didn't dull your skill set.

591
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,250
I got lucky.

592
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,590
About the other night...

593
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,240
<i>I have enough problems with this job.</i>

594
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,090
Second-guessing my best doctors

595
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,680
shouldn't be one of them.

596
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,550
Why are you up here? You have your own bathroom and office now.

597
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,640
Shower. I haven't left the hospital in four days.

598
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,510
Why? House won't go home.

599
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,600
And there's no way I'm leaving him here unsupervised.

600
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,430
House is screwing with you...

601
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,320
By not screwing with you.

602
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,890
He's watching tv d drinking martinis all night.

603
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,200
Meanwhile, he's keeping you here searching for a plan

604
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,130
that doesn't even exist.

605
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,470
How the hell did I not see that?

606
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,250
I'm glad you're back.

607
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,450
Me too.

608
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,500
Either a hot tub or a sauna.

609
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,750
A hot tub would be cool.

610
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,570
New team, old team...

611
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,170
I present...

612
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:17,360
Phase one of operation outer office 2.0.

613
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,670
Nothing's changed.

614
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,960
Oh, everything has changed.

615
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,530
No.

616
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,920
