1
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,010
Nice to meet the pride of Trois-Rivieres.

2
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,920
I still got your Wings rookie card.

3
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,900
So what's that worth? It's a collector's item.

4
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,360
They don't make them like you anymore. So do you wanna go?

5
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,460
Square up. Good luck.

6
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,700
He didn't get a hand on you?

7
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,540
You're going to be a force in the show.

8
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,900
Get a trainer over here!

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,650
i>Capacity crowd is on its feet.</i> <i>Five seconds on the clock.</i>

13
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,790
How is it possible for one man to be blessed with so much skill?

14
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,110
<i>I had one just like this,</i> except it was Bruins and the Habs.

15
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,040
Where did you get it?
Birthday present for someone in pediatric oncology.

16
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,700
22-year-old enforcer with hemoptysis.

17
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,030
He's a hockey player? No, he's a superhero.

18
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,730
<i>He's coughing up blood</i> because he 
probably broke a rib and punctured a lung

19
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,240
while breaking someone else's rib and puncturing
 their lung in the name of sport.

20
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,810
Nice conclusion to which the E.R. already jumped <i>18 hours ago.</i>

21
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,460
Short man equals bullied child.

22
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,140
I was average height as a kid and never bullied.

23
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,360
<i>???Until now.</i>

24
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,800
X- ray ruled out traumatic sequelae,

25
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,630
overt TB, and lung cancer.

26
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,500
Sarcoidosis. Nodules could be too small to show up on an X-ray.

27
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,720
Fighting's the best part of hockey.
<i>Without it, you've got the Ice Capades.</i>

28
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Fighting has nothing to do with hockey.
It's like the cheerleaders at a basketball game.

29
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,220
<i>Cheerleading's the best part of basketball.</i>

30
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,120
Without it you've got... Basketball.

31
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,440
<i>He's a duck hunter.</i>

32
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,060
He could've contracted psittacosis from exposure to fowl.

33
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,600
He had three teeth knocked out two weeks ago.

34
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,750
Infection could've led to oral bleeding.
Not without continuing dental pain.

35
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,890
<i>Then he took an elbow</i> to the gut, which caused an esophageal tear.

36
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,920
Chase, CT the patient. Check for sarcoid.

37
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,120
Adams, sputum cultures and serologies for psittacosis. Taub...

38
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,900
I'd tell you why I think your theory

39
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,210
is not just wrong but ill-conceived, but it's more fun to prove it

40
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,280
by having you check the stool for blood.

41
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,010
And while we wait for the stool fairy,

42
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,360
I'm a man down, so you want to drop your pants

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,810
and hit the ice.

44
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,660
<i>The faster you guys can do this, the better.</i>

45
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,930
The NHL's been sniffing around,

46
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,840
and being in the hospital is not really helping my marketability.

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,050
You have to be pretty good to get called up.

48
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,010
Yeah, leading the league in penalty minutes.

49
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,150
And visits to the E.R., not counting the ones you've caused.

50
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,910
Not a hockey fan, I gather? <i>I am. That's the point.</i>

51
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,580
Fighting cheapens a great sport.

52
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,640
Oh, come on, that's like saying passing cheapens football. It's part of the game.

53
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,600
I don't cause injuries. They're self-inflicted?

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,770
No, I prevent them.

55
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,800
<i>I take the hit</i> so the smaller guys don't have to.

56
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,360
I thought you'd appreciate that.

57
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,210
Neighbor's baby again?

58
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,280
I could hear it through earplugs, two pillows,

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,420
<i>and three sleeping pills.</i>

60
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,380
What is wrong with you?

61
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,200
I just said, "hmm. " <i>You're trying to figure out</i>

62
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,300
some deeper significance to my having a couple of crappy nights.

63
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,680
Which one of us is analyzing the word "hmm" here?

64
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,430
Fine. Sorry.

65
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,090
Apology accepted.

66
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,870
<i>However... Mm.</i> It's not the crying that's keeping you awake.

67
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,650
<i>The sound of a needy child</i> is stirring your paternal juices.

68
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,850
<i>The sound of a needy child</i> at 112 decibels has stirred my inner murderer.

69
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,730
<i>Don't mess with me.</i> Explain the stains on your shirt.

70
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,230
<i>You're lactating.</i>

71
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,230
The fact that you're the only fruit on your family tree

72
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,650
is getting to you.

73
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,230
It's not a big deal.

74
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,120
So I'll probably never be a dad.

75
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,690
It's- it sucks. I'll lose a little sleep, but-

76
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,640
You're not supposed to feel bad when you dodge a bullet.

77
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,580
It's like you got survivor's guilt.

78
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,290
<i>There are actually things</i> in this world that give life even more meaning

79
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,160
than soap operas and monster trucks.

80
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,520
<i>And we happen to be missing out on at least one of them.</i>

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,390
Remember the falconer?

82
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,300
Beth?

83
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,510
You dated two falconers? Yes, Beth.

84
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,820
The night the two of you split up, you came around to my place,

85
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,220
wallowing in self-pity and Tequila.

86
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,020
You passed out.

87
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,960
She called that night, asked me to give you a message.

88
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,740
She said she was pregnant...

89
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,630
Which, God and Planned Parenthood willing,

90
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,390
means you are the father of an 11-year-old.

91
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,680
I told you the next morning...

92
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,210
Hypothetically.

93
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,500
I asked you how you'd feel if Beth had gotten pregnant, and you said, and I quote,

94
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,090
"It would be the worst mistake of my life. "

95
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,180
And... Scene.

96
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,560
Two performances Sunday, dark mondays?

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,650
Just as well.

98
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,710
I want to kill my mother.

99
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,930
My Popo's on her own,

100
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,520
and my mother always needs me to take care of her.

101
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,800
Well, you could kill Popo instead.

102
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,670
I have to take her shopping, to her friends, to Atlantic City.

103
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,080
I love her, but every night, every weekend...

104
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,370
And only if there was some solution, someplace where you could live...

105
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,860
that's not there. My mom would freak.

106
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,140
It would be the ultimate sign of disrespect.

107
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,100
Okay. Then stay.

108
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,430
And maybe you consider not bitching about it?

109
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,460
Not everyone's lucky enough to have your independence.

110
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,080
Don't worry.
When you lose your family, you'll have it too.

111
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,660
He doesn't have sarcoid.

112
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,636
Look at that. That's his spleen. 

113
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:55,486
I know.

114
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,710
But he's gotten it supersized.

115
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,680
Deep vein thrombosis caused by any one of his many injuries or surgeries.

116
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,930
Leukemia's a better fit.

117
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,620
We have a guy who is punishing his body on a daily basis.

118
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,330
Don't you think that's a more likely cause than cancer?

119
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,420
No, because she doesn't have an agenda.

120
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,620
Well, that was incredibly unprofessional.

121
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,250
Well, it was really Taub's fault.

122
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,530
If you're not prepared to slam her into the boards, she's got no reason not to go after you.

123
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,710
Might I suggest pulling her jersey over her head first?

124
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,440
We should get an ultrasound for DVT and WBC for leukemia.

125
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,790
You think I could have cancer?

126
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,880
More likely, it's just a DVT.

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,070
This is my agent. I gotta get this, man.

128
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,890
Give me some good news, Kenny.

129
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,770
I thought you said any day.

130
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,540
Okay.

131
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,810
All right.

132
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,840
I gotta go.

133
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,000
I called Beth.

134
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,350
I have an 11-year-old son.

135
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,930
HEMO???SIS
SPLEN O'MEGALY

136
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,220
Liver failure could alter hormone levels, cause abnormal breast development.

137
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,520
<i>Alcoholism.</i>

138
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,520
We should search his home and locker room.

139
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,660
Note that the person who wants to search the home didn't sleep in one last night.

140
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,860
You have the imprint of a seatbelt buckle in your cheek.

141
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,830
I got in a fight with my mother.

142
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,090
She hit you with a seatbelt?

143
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,280
Could be hemochromatosis.

144
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,270
<i>Explains the liver and the spleen,</i> but hemoptysis is a stretch.

145
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,660
What about leptospirosis?

146
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,160
<i>That's a good fit,</i> if you ignore the fact that he's a pro athlete

147
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,430
who looks like the Incredible Hulk, <i>which means he's gotta be on steroids,</i>

148
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,340
which is a better fit.

149
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,430
All we really know for sure is it was his evil job <i>that caused the problems.</i>

150
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,280
Yes, I don't like him. Doesn't mean my judgment's affected.

151
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,090
Maybe. Let's take a look at the instant replay.

152
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,150
This is the hit that precipitated Booby Orr's fight.

153
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,070
Dirty or clean?

154
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,560
The hit was clean. <i>Really?</i>

155
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,570
The guy released the puck at least a second before the hit.

156
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,960
We have a difference of opinion. That's all.

157
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,260
Absolutely.

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,230
Maybe she's as biased as you.
Or maybe the entire league is.

159
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,240
After review, the league disciplinary commissioner

160
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,120
ruled the hit illegal and dangerous and suspended the player for three games.

161
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,980
Adams and Taub, run antibody titers for lepto.

162
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,710
<i>Chase and Park, check out the home,</i> the locker room for booze, steroids,

163
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,040
and Taub's objectivity.

164
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,910
At least you're free. Going to get your own place?

165
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,170
If I can find a place I can afford,

166
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,080
so... no.

167
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,920
If you want, you can crash at my place

168
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,300
in the spare bedroom.

169
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,320
That might be kind of weird.

170
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,920
I live in an apartment, not a dungeon.

171
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,780
It's just two single people, opposite sex. I-

172
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,770
Your bedroom door has a lock on the inside.

173
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
Hey, if you prefer your car, be my guest.

174
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,940
Scrip for Ganciclovir.

175
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,460
If his neighbor has mono, could mean he has mono.

176
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,160
If he has mono, explains his spleen and hemoptysis.

177
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,680
And it's caused by Epstein-Barr virus,

178
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,990
which explains his liver.

179
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,300
And my moonroof leaks.

180
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,680
Thank you.

181
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,720
Why don't we just assume that you're not the dad?

182
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,220
Either you're the dad, or she cheated on you with your dad.

183
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,350
Oh! Sand art. I used to love this.

184
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,720
He's bitter, not mentally handicapped.

185
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,630
Who knows what Beth told him about you? At worst, you're a rapist.

186
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,280
At best, you're a rapist.

187
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,910
Maybe she said I was a dead war hero.

188
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,290
Raised by a lunatic mother and abandoned by his father.

189
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,190
Oh, I know! Squirrel handcuffs. You think he's gotten any of those?

190
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,750
If you really wanted me to do nothing with this information,

191
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,060
then why did you give it to me?

192
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,380
Because you were pining for a kid,

193
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,110
and you deserved to know that you already had one.

194
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,250
But your parental cravings are more theoretical than applied.

195
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,350
You want vicarious immortality more than you want a lifelong burden.

196
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,130
You're assuming he's going to be a nightmare.
What if he's a good kid?

197
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,120
He's a kid.

198
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,530
Best you can hope for is he's a nightmare.

199
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,620
House, I'm not naive.
I realize that this thing could go very badly,

200
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,220
but the point is my son wants to meet me.

201
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,800
And I want to meet him.

202
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,650
Popo, I presume.

203
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,870
<i>Hey, uh,</i> I let myself in.

204
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,330
Um, this is-

205
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,520
We've met.

206
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,170
I thought the whole point of this was to get away from Popo.

207
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,430
My dad's getting a cyst removed, and my mother had to take him to the clinic.

208
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,730
Don't worry. She'll be gone in an hour.

209
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,330
I'm not worried, because it's not my issue.

210
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,450
She seems awfully quiet.

211
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,590
You haven't seen her drunk.

212
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,240
<i>Bobby?</i>

213
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,000
I found him crying in the fetal position.

214
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,300
<i>It's not a new symptom.</i>

215
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,410
<i>He's crying because his liver failure</i>
<i>threw his hormones out of whack.</i>

216
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,450
Aside from the crying, he's actually recovering nicely.

217
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,450
<i>Aside from the guy in the book depository,</i>
<i>the Kennedys had a lovely trip to Dallas.</i>

218
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,330
Repetitive blows to the head can cause chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

219
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,100
symptoms of which are aggressive behavior and depression.

220
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,870
So your theory is that his aggressive behavior caused his aggressive behavior.

221
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,040
<i>He's not depressed.</i>

222
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,230
He's just bummed because he knows he's a talentless moron who's only one lost fight

223
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,880
away from being a barista. I understand that can get to a guy after a while.

224
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,170
If he quits being an enforcer, it could save his life.

225
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,980
You don't want to save his life.

226
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,130
You want to kill his career.

227
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,400
I moved into Chase's apartment.

228
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,670
He knows. He was staring at our matching cups.

229
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,830
<i>I told you we should split up.</i>

230
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,420
We're not having sex. With each other..

231
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,750
Yet. Yes.

232
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,150
Yes?

233
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,070
<i>I just mean no one knows</i> the future right now, so we don't really know-

234
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,650
The only conclusive test <i>for CTE is post-mortem.</i>

235
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,810
<i>But an MRI of his brain</i> <i>could reveal white matter disintegrity,</i>

236
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,700
<i>which is the effect of CTE.</i>

237
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,510
Why? Are you trying to sleep with her?

238
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,770
'Cause the simpler technique is just to ask.
I was doing something nice. Mm, no.

239
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,390
Th-mm. No, that doesn't fit.

240
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,750
<i>He's only had three concussions</i> since he was ten.

241
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,170
It's not enough to cause CTE.

242
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,360
Three reported concussions.
These guys are taught in high school how to dupe the tests.

243
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,820
-Guilt?
-This is really insulting.

244
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,190
<i>It's not guilt.</i> Park is a friend.

245
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,460
So it's guilt.

246
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,630
<i>Chase convinced you to leave mommy,</i>

247
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,700
and now he feels responsible.

248
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,020
<i>No MRI. Do a psych eval.</i>

249
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,530
If he doesn't start weeping again, send him home.

250
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,880
<i>Dr. Wilson?</i>

251
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,200
Duncan.

252
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,190
Uh, James.

253
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,710
Uh, n-n-nice to meet you.

254
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,460
It's nice to meet you.

255
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,820
How are you doing?

256
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,010
Good.

257
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,010
Good.

258
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,130
I got you this.

259
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,380
Thank you. Go ahead.

260
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,690
Okay.

261
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,440
It's got three games built in,
but you can download more from the website.

262
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,420
Yeah, I know.

263
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,480
You already have one.

264
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,120
I can always use a backup.

265
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,860
Hi, can I start you with something to drink?
Just water, please.

266
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,120
You got a Gamedeck?

267
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,830
<i>Way to go, Dad.</i>

268
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,310
According to your psych eval,

269
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,880
the only thing happier than you is Disneyland.

270
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,860
I'm sorry you had to see me like that last night.

271
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,150
I'm just upset about being in the hospital and...

272
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,710
I'm on some weird meds, but they must be working,

273
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,840
because I'm feeling a lot better now.

274
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,850
Depression could be the symptom of a serious illness.

275
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,440
CTE.

276
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,500
Yeah, my aunt sends me every article she can find on it.

277
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,820
And you know it could kill you. In the long run, like a lot of things.

278
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,860
<i>You might be right.</i>
And an MRI could confirm that.

279
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,360
I have enough evidence of head trauma in my file already, so...

280
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,220
My mom said you had trouble maintaining relationships

281
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,000
with normal people.

282
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,740
She also said you were a nice guy.

283
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,990
I always figured she was lying 'cause she didn't want me to hate my deadbeat dad.

284
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,590
I didn't know-

285
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,480
I- I know... Now.

286
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,630
You're a bright kid. Thanks to you.

287
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,690
Thanks to my mom, I'm also a big, soft-hearted wuss.

288
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,410
I think you may have gotten that from both of us.

289
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,870
Uh, I gotta go, but it was really nice meeting you.

290
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,950
It was nice meeting you, Duncan.

291
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,120
Uh, you want to hang out again?

292
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,850
Absolutely.

293
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,320
Tonight?

294
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,250
Tonight?

295
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,740
Well, I-I- there's, um...

296
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,670
That would be great. Okay.

297
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,760
I'll text you.

298
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,650
Thank you. How did you talk him into it?

299
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,210
He agreed once I promised him anonymity.

300
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,830
Mr. and Mrs. Doe liked the name John apparently.

301
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,380
Unfortunately we just wasted his time and proved House right.
Nothing?

302
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,920
What about that? That's an artifact.

303
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,670
That's a density.

304
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,340
I know you think I'm convincing myself, <i>but this brain has been hammered for years,</i>

305
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,850
meaning evidence may be subtle, but it's there.

306
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,380
<i>Meaning you see what you want to see.</i>

307
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,020
Unless, of course, Chase is an idiot, and I do have brain damage.

308
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,810
Patient's stroking out.

309
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,850
<i>Chase?</i> Can you get me out of-

310
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,770
Hello?

311
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,440
The good news is, it's isolated ophthalmoplegia,

312
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,030
which means you didn't have a stroke.
Bad news is, Taub was right.

313
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,480
You're still sick. I said "right," not "competent. "

314
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,180
<i>Bursts your CTE bubble.</i>

315
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,610
You're going to need a whole new theory to keep Uncle Jesse

316
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,110
<i>and his Olsen twins on the bench.</i>

317
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,820
Can we discuss my incompetence somewhere else?

318
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,920
Dr. House. Could I talk to you for a minute?

319
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,090
Could be neurosyphilis. He's only 22.

320
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,070
And he's been on the road since he was 14.

321
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,660
So he was trash even before he was trash?

322
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,500
You curious about what he wanted?

323
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,060
I assume he wanted me off the case, and you told him I was hit in the head as a child,

324
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,130
and your mother made you promise to take care of me.

325
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,290
He was doing what he always does- sticking up for the little guy.

326
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,090
He told me to apologize to you,

327
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,280
or he would excrete down my throat.

328
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm paraphrasing.

329
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,220
So if he should ask, I was a gentleman,

330
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,960
or I will excrete down your throat.

331
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,100
Microscopic polyangiitis fits.

332
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,900
We should start plasmapheresis immediately.

333
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,510
We need to run an ANCA panel to confirm first.

334
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,050
Putting him on plasmapheresis could make him bleed out.
MPA can progress quickly.

335
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,020
We may not have time before it reaches his lungs.

336
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,980
I think you're right.

337
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,700
Thus confirming my objectivity.

338
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,740
Start the treatment.

339
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,980
Miserable yet?

340
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,610
He's polite, well-adjusted, and a straight-A student.

341
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,470
Which means he doesn't need you.

342
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,370
So why don't you get out while the butterfly effect is still in the cocoon stage?

343
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,090
I'm making him dinner. You don't make an 11-year-old dinner.

344
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,170
You give him a jar of peanut butter.

345
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,130
It'll be fine. I could give this kid a quinoa salad,

346
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,530
and he would eat it just to be nice.

347
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,140
'Cause he's a gutless placater, just like his dad.

348
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,690
He's nice.

349
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,360
This is a terrible idea. Because we like each other?

350
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,500
Yes.

351
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,380
'Cause of the statement "we like each other. "
You've known him 25 minutes.

352
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,920
All you know about him is that he'd lie about a quinoa salad, whatever the hell that is.

353
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,970
You're jealous of an 11-year-old

354
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,280
because you are an 11-year-old.

355
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,580
So tell me about yourself.

356
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,270
I mean, you're smart, you're nice, but what else?

357
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,490
I don't know. I'm a kid.

358
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,460
Right.

359
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,630
What are you looking for?

360
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,720
Nothing.

361
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,860
You want... peanut butter?

362
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,960
Do you have prosciutto?

363
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,090
You like prosciutto?

364
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,550
I'm weird. No, no.

365
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,170
I- I like it too.
I've got some in the fridge. How about goat cheese?

366
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,260
I love goat cheese.

367
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,420
I think that was the best pizza I ever had.

368
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,260
It was the hint of dijon.

369
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,110
Do you have any aunts or uncles or grandparents?

370
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,270
My mom got into some stupid fight with my grandfather.
They all kind of cut us off.

371
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,790
<i>Are you talking to your parents?</i>

372
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,730
Yes, and they're going to be very surprised

373
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,970
and excited to meet you. That's awesome.

374
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,290
You have arrived at your destination.

375
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,650
Well- Thanks for the pizza.

376
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,560
Sure, sure. It was, uh-

377
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,340
I mean, it was great to spend time with you and-

378
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,820
I love you, Dad.

379
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,790
Can't be easy doing what you do.

380
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,880
I mean, do you love it? Is it fun?

381
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:50,380
I had my own plastic surgery practice making lots of money,

382
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,370
 but I wasn't happy.

383
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,770
It wasn't what I went to med school for.

384
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,960
Every winter my dad would flood the backyard and made a rink.

385
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,340
I was Lemieux. My little brother was Gretzky.

386
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,780
I was good.

387
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,300
I won the NDHA scoring title three years in a row.

388
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,870
<i>I kept getting bigger</i> and stronger and better...

389
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,800
till I didn't.

390
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,440
<i>Juniors coach told me that,</i>

391
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,610
if I wanted to stay on the team, then I'd have to use my size.

392
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,370
Every game, I got less and less ice time

393
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,530
until it was all fighting and no hockey.

394
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,460
<i>I, uh...</i>

395
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,360
There's something going on with my arms.

396
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,300
I can't feel them. I-

397
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,130
<i>Doctor, I can't feel my arms.</i>

398
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,100
Patient's arms are now paralyzed. ANCA panel was negative.

399
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,970
It's not MPA. Lyme disease could cause paralysis.

400
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,960
<i>If he was hunting, he'd be exposed to ticks.</i>

401
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,000
No target rash or cardiac involvement.

402
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,130
Roomies with benefits keeping you up?

403
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,080
Cribbage. Played with Park's Popo.

404
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,620
Is that two separate events?

405
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,800
Grandmother.

406
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,440
<i>ALS could explain the symptoms.</i> Sensory involvement rules out ALS.

407
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,430
Okay, yeah. This is interesting. We'll get back to the patient in a second.

408
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,230
<i>Your issue is the same as Wilson's, except...</i>

409
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,680
you're haunted by the pitter-patter of tiny skanks.

410
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,040
<i>You don't feel guilty</i> about getting Park thrown out of her home.

411
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,780
You feel guilty about all the women that you've screwed over.

412
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,940
My mother needs 1,000 bucks for snow tires.

413
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,530
Park's a friend. Popo's fun.

414
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,570
Paralysis has gone from his face to his arms,

415
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,620
meaning it's descending, which is the hallmark of botulism.

416
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,700
So it was something he ate. How innocuous.

417
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,640
You've overcome your bias by reversing it.

418
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,850
The only problem is that being in love with a patient

419
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,770
is just as judgmental as being in hate. We didn't find any contaminated-

420
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,820
No contaminated food. I'm not an idiot.

421
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,140
But what if it's not from ingesting but from injecting?

422
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,530
He was treated for intractable muscle spasms
by the team's trainers.

423
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,200
Sometimes they use Botox.

424
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,810
We need to start the antitoxin- The antitoxin could cause anaphylaxis.

425
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,700
We need to test first to confirm.

426
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,670
<i>As if to prove my point, last time you said</i> there wasn't enough time to test

427
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,390
prior to a more dangerous treatment.

428
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,220
<i>It's a different situation,</i>
different symptom, different diagnosis.

429
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,780
Different emotion.

430
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,280
Give him the antitoxin.

431
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,770
Anything? No adverse effects.

432
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,560
<i>Chase let me move in with him</i>
to get away from my grandmother.

433
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,460
Then he practically let my grandmother move in with the both of us.

434
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,140
He's being way more than nice.

435
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,760
Then which answer is it?

436
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,960
Chase feels guilty for pushing you to move out?
He didn't push me.

437
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,620
Guilt about skanks? He loves skanks. It's not the other option.

438
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,930
There are people that like me.

439
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,930
<i>People even want to sleep with me.</i>
Some of them are even good-looking.

440
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,510
That good-looking?

441
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,790
Did you see that?

442
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,910
You're feeling something? Yeah.

443
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,080
I could give you crap for making me wait 11 years,

444
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,560
but instead I'm going to thank you

445
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,190
for not making me wait another 11.

446
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,000
Every little girl wants a pony till they have to clean up after it.

447
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,880
You think I'm going to quit on this?
On an 11-year-old?

448
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,780
The only relationship you haven't quit on has been with me.

449
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,610
Hmm. A needy, truculent narcissist.

450
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,200
I think it's been perfect training for parenthood.

451
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,870
That's not even close.

452
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,320
This is the rest of your life.

453
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,920
You screw this up, you don't get to run away.

454
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,180
You get to ruin both your lives.

455
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,940
This is a bigger responsibility than any you've ever taken on

456
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,730
and screwed up.

457
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,830
I know.

458
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,020
That's why I'm so excited about it.

459
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,790
You're really happier doing this than looking at boobs all day?

460
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,810
Luckily I get patients like you every now and again

461
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,410
who let me reexperience the joy.

462
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,320
You know, the best part of my day is when I'm sitting

463
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,020
in that penalty box after I beat someone up.

464
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,260
That's the only time I know I'm safe.

465
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,460
Think Lemieux ever felt that way?

466
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm not going back. <i>To hockey?</i>

467
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,590
To enforcing... Whatever that costs.

468
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,600
Good for you.

469
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,510
First goal for the pocket rocket.

470
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,960
Bobby?

471
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,420
We need a team in here!

472
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,900
He's completely paralyzed, and he tested negative for botulism.

473
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,640
I am now accepting long shots.

474
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,700
Polio.

475
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,010
<i>Some kids were never vaccinated.</i>

476
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,750
Unless they played sports all their lives and had two physicals a year.

477
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,950
How about MLD? <i>That's a bad fit.</i>

478
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,790
I say that not because there's no treatment for MLD

479
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,020
but because it's a bad fit. His cognitive abilities are unaffected.

480
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,650
Prion disease could explain the waxing and waning symptoms.

481
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,250
The test for Prions is a brain biopsy.

482
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,740
Given his history, there's got to be brain swelling.

483
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,390
We can't risk drilling into his skull. Pretty sure we can.

484
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,760
We also could keep talking until we can find an answer we all can agree on.

485
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,430
All of us?

486
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,470
Those who love him, those who hate him, those who don't give a crap about him or you-

487
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,180
Or I could just discuss it on my own with Foreman.

488
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,030
He's not your friend. I get it.

489
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,460
He's a patient. I'm not-
He never had your back.

490
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,430
He didn't insist that I apologize to you.

491
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,950
He asked me to take you off the case.

492
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,840
Biopsy his brain.

493
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,540
Hey, Dad.

494
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,300
Sorry I'm late. Got in a fight with my mom.

495
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,280
She's such a tool. I'm sure she means well.

496
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,210
She wants to open a reserve in Costa Rica

497
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,190
for rescued birds of prey.

498
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,600
But how serious is she?

499
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,690
From my recollection, she used to talk about doing a lot-

500
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,580
Yeah, but she bought plane tickets for Monday.

501
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,250
Well, Costa Rica is beautiful.

502
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,910
And the schools are supposed to be great.
Oh, I'm not going.

503
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,750
It's her stupid dream, not mine.

504
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,110
Then what will you do?

505
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,450
I- I thought maybe I could, uh...

506
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,480
Maybe I could stay with you?

507
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,080
Uh, y-your place is only 3 miles away from my school.

508
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,020
I could bus it every day. And I do my own laundry.

509
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,280
I keep my room tidy.

510
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,250
Duncan, th-this-

511
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,680
This is very sudden.

512
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,420
I know.

513
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,570
I'm sorry.

514
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,570
Please don't send me to the jungle.

515
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,630
If it's okay with your mother, it's okay with me.

516
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,840
Take me off the case.

517
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,290
I've obviously completely lost my objectivity.

518
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,020
I'm not helping, I'm not even neutral.

519
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,730
Agreed.

520
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,340
So why shouldn't I take you off all my cases?

521
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,370
Because you were right. I hate bullies.

522
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,520
You work for me. You're not a bully.

523
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,230
Pretty sure I am, dickwad.

524
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,350
I've known a lot of bullies- people who didn't like me because I'm short,

525
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,430
people who didn't like me because I'm Jewish- Yeah, I get it.

526
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,370
There's a long list of reasons not to like you.

527
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,970
You relentlessly mock, but it's not for self-aggrandizement.

528
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,100
It's because ideas are bigger than feelings.

529
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,430
<i>At least that's what I choose to believe.</i>

530
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,100
I also thought you had the side effect of desensitizing me.

531
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,700
You little Hebe.

532
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,380
Here's some ideas for you. You screwed up.

533
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,430
You kept on screwing up. Everything you said is true,

534
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,220
except...

535
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,370
It doesn't mean you walk away.

536
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,290
You just learn to trust nothing.

537
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,170
<i>Everything you think you feel,</i>

538
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,130
everything you think you know.

539
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,100
Question every call, <i>play through every whistle.</i>

540
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,000
I just had a light bulb.
Maybe.

541
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,990
You can trust light bulbs.

542
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,170
Stop.

543
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,920
It's not Prions. Epstein-Barr gave him mono.

544
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,280
It also gave him Miller Fisher syndrome.

545
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,190
The plasmapheresis played through the whistle.

546
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,330
<i>We gave it to him for MPA,</i> but when he got worse, we took him off.

547
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,950
When he got better, we thought it was the antitoxin.

548
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,870
But it was actually the plasmapheresis still working.

549
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,690
We had the right treatment, just the wrong diagnosis.

550
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,510
It was my metaphor that solved the case.

551
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,370
<i>Put him back on plasmapheresis. He'll be fine.</i>

552
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,610
Nice save.

553
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,620
Didn't quite make up for being a sieve the rest of the game.

554
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,660
Ex-girlfriend's baby again?

555
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,140
<i>His mother is moving to Costa Rica.</i>

556
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,590
He asked if he could move in with me.

557
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,960
And I said yes.

558
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,720
Well, it's only six or seven years.

559
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:30,810
<i>Unless he can't get into college, in which case,</i> it's more a matter of your life expectancy.

560
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,270
<i>I said yes,</i> knowing I'm not remotely ready for that,

561
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,390
knowing he's not ready to be separated from his mother.

562
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,080
This isn't the act of a mature, rational adult.

563
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,920
<i>I-</i>

564
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,640
I can't do this, House.

565
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,380
<i>You were right.</i>

566
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,660
I have an idea...
that can make this entire problem go away.

567
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,370
Yes, I really want to hear <i>your clever late-term abortion joke.</i>

568
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,500
You were right about everything. This is life. It's real.

569
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,560
It doesn't just go away.

570
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,600
None of that is true.

571
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,260
Duncan.

572
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,490
Actually... Wendel.

573
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,540
One "I."

574
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,970
<i>If you're going to get pissy,</i>

575
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,470
remember, it was House's idea.

576
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,750
You're an actor?

577
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,210
<i>Five commercials and a recurring on Days of Our Lives.</i>

578
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,520
You were regretting not having kids, so I gave you one...

579
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,290
Thereby rendering you regret-free.

580
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,820
It's a priceless gift.

581
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,000
<i>Get out. Well, it's not priceless</i> 'cause he charges SAG minimum.

582
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,740
Get out!

583
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,100
Chillax, Dad.

584
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,650
Can you do an Australian accent?

585
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,370
I just got the call.

586
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,680
Three-year deal. $2.1 million.

587
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,500
What about the flooded backyard and pretending to be Lemieux?

588
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,650
That's why I took it.

589
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,570
After all I did to get here,

590
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,990
half a dream is better than nothing.

591
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:08,100
Maybe my new coach will see what my juniors coach didn't.

592
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,900
That'd be nice.

593
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,220
I'm not sleeping with you.

594
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,360
That's a shame.

595
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,200
This is about Popo.

596
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,960
She's not sleeping with me either, right?

597
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,470
You were jealous of me.

598
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,020
My family.

599
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,070
Maybe you've got too much, and I've got too little.

600
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,310
I might sleep with you after all.

601
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,850
The woman that I called- that was really Beth?

602
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,890
Found her on Facebook.

603
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,730
How much did she charge?

604
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,200
Nothing. She's still pissed at you.

605
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,540
that's???

606
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,510
I thought you liked prosciutto.

607
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,570
Nobody likes prosciutto.

608
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:14,790
