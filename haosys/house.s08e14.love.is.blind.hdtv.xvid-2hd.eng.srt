1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,250
Telling you, Will, you got a real winner here.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,250
She's just gonna love it.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,510
Stacy, box her up.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,890
Oh. Just the box.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,940
I'm sure it's prettier than the paper.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,670
One tiny rock.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,560
So many other cool things I could have bought for myself.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,510
Sam, Stacy, it's been a pleasure being ripped off by you.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,760
<i>Such a nice boy.</i>

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Too bad he's a handicap.

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,200
Excuse me.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,470
Thank you.

13
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,690
You all right, man? Take it easy, man!

14
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,750
It's okay. It's okay.

15

18
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,560
 Kid's a blind diabetic.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,030
He's hyperglycemic hyperosmolar.

20
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,180
Which is what we thought until his blood tests showed a controlled sugar level and no ketones.

21
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,400
It could be caused by drug abuse. His tox screens were clean.

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,760
<i>You lying sack of crap.</i>

23
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,060
I have them right in front of me. Not you.

24
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,940
This time. My former BFF.

25
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,690
He's S-M-I-T-B-A-W-A.

26
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,080
<i>Stabbing me in the back as we speak.</i>

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,820
Where exactly are you? <i>If anyone should happen to ask,</i>

28
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,020
I'm in an out-of-state medical conference until further notice.

29
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,410
Why would any-
and... Don't really care.

30
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,870
Auditory hallucinations <i>and disorientation could be signs of schizophrenia.</i>

31
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,210
<i>They did a psych consult.</i> <i>Mental status is normal.</i>

32
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:13,200
Seizure, noise-induced epilepsy- <i>the sound of rush hour traffic could have set it off.</i>

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,100
Run an E.E.G.
Blast his brain with harmonics to find out.

34
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,010
<i>Also, if anyone should further happen to ask,</i>

35
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,380
I spent the whole last year in Africa <i>with Doctors Without Boundaries.</i>

36
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,820
Who are you hiding from?

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,990
Evil.

38
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,500
Where's House?

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,920
Uh, he's at an out-of-state medical conference.

40
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,370
In Baltimore.

41
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,380
I think.

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,030
Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,010
I'm Blythe, his mother.

44
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,600
Do you want me to pick up the braille writer and laptop from your apartment?

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,360
I don't plan on being here that long. I didn't eat lunch yesterday.

46
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,420
I probably just fainted. <i>Or had an epileptic seizure.</i>

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,290
Which is only one possibility. I'm Doctor Chase.

48
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,050
Uh, we'd like to discuss your case with you privately.

49
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,060
<i>I'm his girlfriend. Is it all right</i> if I stay for this? Melissa can stay.

50
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,800
And I've never had a seizure before in my life. They can be mild.

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,620
Like a loss of concentration or a muscle tremor.

52
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,450
A lot of times a family member notices before the patient does.

53
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,080
I'm Doctor Park, by the way.

54
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,670
I'm 5'2", Asian, and I'm totally cool with it

55
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,900
if you wanna feel my face. Blind people only do that in movies.

56
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,010
But you sound nice, so if you want me to...

57
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,010
Her point was, you may not have realized

58
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,520
you were having a seizure, that maybe your girlfriend has?

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,730
No.

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,840
But I-I haven't seen him for the last five months.

61
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,210
We were on a break. <i>Like Rachel and Ross on Friends.</i>

62
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,420
Never seen the show myself, but I hear it's good.

63
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,350
That joke usually kills my blind friends.

64
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,200
Will, this is serious. No, it's not.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,870
Since I don't have epilepsy.

66
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,350
I have to pay attention to every signal <i>my body sends or receives.</i>

67
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,210
Or I end up taking a dirt nap.

68
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,430
You don't think I'd know if I was having seizures?

69
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,250
<i>It's probably just low blood sugar.</i> If that's true, then you shouldn't have

70
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,820
a problem passing our test.

71
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,840
How is he, James, really?

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,950
He's better than I've seen him in a long time. Is he happy?

73
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,210
<i>It's okay.</i>

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,260
He's always been a complicated child.

75
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,970
Were you in the hospital recently?

76
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,630
Oh, nothing serious. <i>I just had a few moles removed yesterday</i>

77
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,850
and forgot I even had it on.

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,600
Look, if Greg happens to get back early from the conference,

79
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,810
I'm staying at a hotel in town for the next three days.

80
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,230
I would like him to call me. I will pass it on.

81
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,440
<i>Thank you.</i>

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,570
<i>Um, do you think that they would mind</i> if I got a refill for the road?

83
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,120
Not at all. Good.

84
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,100
<DEALING WITH YOUR TERMINAL CANCER>

85
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,250
Not seeing any seizure activity in response to low frequency sounds.

86
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,220
I'm starting him on mid-range. Have you seen his girlfriend?

87
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,030
Extremely hot.

88
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,070
Blind people can't have attractive girlfriends? Not my point.

89
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,600
He actually convinced her to go for the whole relationship break thing.

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,120
How do you know it wasn't her idea? <i>Because she's back with him.</i>

91
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,660
Women suggest a break when they wanna break up.

92
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,160
Men do it because they wanna have sex
with other women before they settle down.

93
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,380
They're a little young to get married, don't you think?

94
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,180
I was their age when I did.

95
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,460
I see your point. 

96
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,330
HE'S SEIZING

97
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,640
<i>Sound frequency's at 300 hertz.</i>

98
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,910
It's not a seizure.

99
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,820
He's not spiking on his E.E.G.

100
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,020
He's not moving air.

101
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,880
I I think he's choking on something.

102
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,660
Blood. I don't see any blockage.

103
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,860
Help me move him.

104
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,610
Just relax and breathe.

105
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,560
What-what are these?

106
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,240
Three teeth detached from his jawbone and lodged in his throat.

107
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,840
He almost choked to death on them. Environmental?

108
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,130
Could be heavy metal poisoning or radiation exposure.

109
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,900
Then he wouldn't be the only one.

110
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,690
He's an accountant who works
on the same floor with 50 other people.

111
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,480
Maybe his girlfriend poisoned him.

112
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,980
House usually thinks that's a good guess.

113
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,080
And she's gotta be pissed off and have low self-esteem.

114
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,570
<i>Why else would she</i> give him a free pass to pork other women?

115
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,200
<i>Because he's handicapped.</i> <i>Women feel sorry for us.</i>

116
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,310
<i>This cane is tail bait.</i> Where are you now?

117
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,310
Expect an actual answer this time?

118
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,560
<i>Hi, guys.</i>
<i>Was wondering if House's</i> <i>mother left yet.</i>

119
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,830
<i>He won't let me go to a hos-</i> <i>It's not environmental, it's periodontitis.</i>

120
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,440
An oral infection doesn't explain his disorientation and auditory hallucinations.

121
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,730
<i>They're laughing because they know</i>
<i>diabetes exacerbates the condition.</i>

122
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,030
<i>It could progress to a systemic disease.</i>

123
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,500
The bacteria spread and affect other organs. <i>Like his brain.</i>

124
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,810
<i>Start him on broad spectrum antibiotics</i> <i>and book him an appointment with a periodontist.</i>

125
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,080
He has fake children now, too?

126
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,910
You think I'm not good enough for your mother.

127
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,190
Not in front of the kids, Honey.

128
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,800
Hey, add a couple of flies, toss in a dead goat or two, we might have a winner.

129
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,440
She gone?

130
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,820
Yeah.

131
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,250
We really need to talk.

132
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,820
Okay. Crayons down.

133
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,990
Line up if you wanna get paid.

134
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,040
It's the only time I ever successfully lie to my mom;

135
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,260
<i>is through the elaborate preparations</i> and props.

136
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,220
I said no Transformers, Slick.

137
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,170
Stay here until the coast is clear.

138
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,320
Fine.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,720
But you sleep on couch tonight. You sleeping with her now?

140
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,790
Just in case an I.N.S. guy comes in through the window.

141
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,730
Yeah, she didn't buy it either. You need to talk to your mother.

142
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,690
When I'm ready.

143
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,470
Still need to get a fake passport, doctored photos, maybe a case of Aids.

144
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,990
She's sick, House.

145
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,470
Did she say that? She was wearing a hospital admission bracelet

146
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,340
and carrying around a book on dealing with terminal cancer.

147
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,790
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,310
She's staying at the Grand for the next three days.

149
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,220
The antibiotics will stop the infection from spreading further.

150
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,130
And I'll spare you the lecture you'll get from the periodontist tomorrow,

151
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,250
but you need to practice better oral hygiene.

152
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,550
So are you guys saying this is happening because, what,

153
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,850
<i>- I didn't floss enough? - Probably didn't help,</i>

154
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,520
but diabetics are prone to this type of infection.

155
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,630
Half the time, he doesn't even bother getting undressed before he goes to bed.

156
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,800
<i>Can only imagine how many times you've skipped</i> <i>brushing your teeth since we-</i>

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,700
sorry. <i>I don't mean to lecture you, babe.</i>

158
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,540
Well, I guess you're right.

159
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,010
Look, you haven't eaten anything all day.

160
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,630
Why don't you go grab a bite?
I'll be fine.

161
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,380
All right, well, I'll see you in an hour, okay? Not if I see you first.

162
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,840
I was wondering if I could ask you guys for a favor.

163
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,440
I really need my laptop and braille writer, and I can't ask Melissa to get them for me.

164
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,070
Why not? Because...

165
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,490
I want you to put this someplace safe.

166
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,750
It's beautiful.

167
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,120
People always say diamonds are beautiful.

168
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,930
But to me they just feel cold. They have really sharp edges.

169
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,430
I guess convincing her to take a break was a good thing.

170
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,660
Well, the break was her idea. <i>Melissa's the only girl I've ever dated.</i>

171
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,810
She wanted me to be sure before we... took the next step.

172
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,620
Yeah.

173
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,450
What are you doing? We're here.

174
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,570
We might as well search the place <i>in case we're wrong about periodontitis.</i>

175
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,870
What are you doing? We're here. Might as well eat.

176
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,960
You're stealing food from a blind man?

177
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,120
We're doing him a favor. He owes me.

178
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,790
I take it from your low self-esteem theory

179
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,210
you have some experience with relationship breaks?

180
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,660
What happened?

181
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,990
He talked me in it, then...

182
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,690
Slept with three of my friends. Then dumped my ass.

183
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,320
College boyfriend. Thought he was the love of my life.

184
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,970
Then why agree to a break?

185
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,730
My self-esteem wasn't as high back then.

186
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,150
No one's is.

187
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,510
Sugar free!

188
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,300
Ugh. Disgusting.

189
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,170
I'll check the bathroom. You keep checking the snacks,

190
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,620
Greg. Sorry I didn't call first.

191
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,140
I just flew back from my conference.

192
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,450
Um, this-this really isn't, uh-

193
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,230
I need your medical records

194
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,110
and the name of your primary physician.

195
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,280
<i>Well, you remember Mr. Bell.</i>

196
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,870
Well, if I didn't, I will now.

197
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,430
You're not dying?

198
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,620
I, uh... I may have mislead James

199
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,580
by letting him see a book on cancer.

200
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,410
We did, however, have some expectations that you might call first.

201
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,850
Yeah.

202
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,200
This isn't how I envisioned you finding out.

203
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,070
Mr. Bell and I, we're...

204
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,160
Having sex, got it.
Getting married.

205
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,200
Also.

206
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,080
We wanted you to be the first to know.

207
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,400
I need 10 milligrams of benzodiazepine.

208
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,600
Help me hold him down.

209
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,710
I'm putting epilepsy back on the table. And I'm taking it off because <i>it doesn't explain losing his teeth.</i>

210
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,890
<i>The kid's diabetic.</i>
The periodontitis could be real but completely unrelated.

211
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,910
Coincidence. Buying that, House?

212
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,800
Until I hear something that takes my mind off

213
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,890
the Jurassic schlong that I was traumatized by this afternoon.

214
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,920
I know what's wrong with the patient.

215
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,770
Illegal drugs. Some kind of acid.

216
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,710
His tox screens were clean. His apartment wasn't.

217
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,890
We didn't find any drugs.

218
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,060
Then why am I completely tripping balls right now?

219
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,460
I'm seriously freaking out here, guys.

220
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,140
Can't you tell?

221
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,360
You pretty much look the same as you always do.

222
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,320
Take your glasses off.

223
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,920
Pupils dilated...

224
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,020
Pulse elevated. Hallucinating?

225
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,800
I think so, because...

226
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,770
He's a rabbit.

227
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,740
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

228
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,980
Because she's his wife.

229
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,690
They flirt a lot. I've seen things.

230
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,280
Mm, Taub- Taub is either...

231
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,650
A tooth fairy or... Rainbow Brite.

232
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,000
And you...

233
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,930
You're just House.

234
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,370
She ate ice cream and Gummi Bears at the patient's apartment.

235
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,360
One of 'em must have been dosed with it.

236
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,190
Go back and find the drugs. You two, <i>find out where he bought them,</i>

237
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,860
and then MRI his brain. <i>Check for infections, masses, and plaques.</i>

238
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,020
Am I gonna die?

239
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,600
We'll get back to you on that.

240
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,460
I've been blind since birth.

241
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,700
I thought maybe if I tried LSD,

242
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:30,450
I might, you know... Colors... a shape.

243
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,950
<i>I just-</i> I just wanted to see something.

244
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,140
How many times? Maybe five or six.

245
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,200
We need to know where you bought it so we can find out what was in it.

246
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,030
My girlfriend gave it to me.

247
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,580
I'll find her. No, don't.

248
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,360
It-it wasn't Melissa.
I met someone else.

249
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,160
When were you planning on telling her that,

250
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,500
before or after you ask her to marry you?

251
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,090
The ring isn't for her. We were on a break.

252
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,520
She wanted me to see what else was out there, and I did.

253
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,870
<i>I was gonna tell her the other night,</i> but I ended up here instead.

254
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,010
We just need to talk to the one who supplied the drugs.

255
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,550
She's on vacation with her parents.

256
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,220
This is her cell. I don't want her to know I'm in the hospital.

257
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,510
She'll only freak out. That's very considerate of you.

258
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,840
You think this is easy for me.

259
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,180
I know I have to tell Melissa.

260
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,600
Well, what's stopping you? <i>She's still one of my best friends.</i>

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,120
And I don't want to be alone in here.

262
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,980
Have you seen your mother yet? <i>She's not dying.</i>

263
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,080
She was having sex with my father.

264
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,910
Ignore her. She's on acid.

265
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,400
Your father's dead, House.

266
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,940
Not the dead dad, the biological dad.

267
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,110
The one I pointed out to you at fake father's funeral.

268
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,870
Are you sure?

269
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,330
Your only evidence is that birthmark you saw
when you were 12.

270
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,870
Well, now I've seen two.

271
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,470
Good news is I won't technically be a bastard
much longer.

272
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,580
We're gonna be one big crappy family.

273
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,520
Well, that's- that's great news.

274
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,420
Your mother won't be alone anymore, and you can finally get to know the guy.

275
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,760
Yes, that is one option.

276
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,810
Are you saying you're not even curious?

277
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,050
You want to know what I think? I think you know the answer to that question.

278
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,110
You avoid your mother because she's the one person whose opinion you actually care about.

279
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,630
If that was true, you'd have every reason to shut up. I avoid my mother because she's boring.

280
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,230
That's why you've been so open and honest about prison and marrying a complete stranger.

281
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,090
Even if I care what she thinks, why would I care what some sperm donor does?

282
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,290
You read the guy's book about three times. Years ago.

283
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,330
It took three times because it was so badly written.

284
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,510
Oh, I get it.

285
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,730
The second birthmark was on his penis, right?

286
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,830
He's a dick. <i>You've been working for House for months</i>

287
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,580
and just now realized that disabled people can also be dicks?

288
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,700
What he's doing now to that girl isn't fair. The break was her idea.

289
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,940
And now she thinks they're back together.

290
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,510
He's a scared, sick, blind kid who doesn't want to be alone.

291
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,790
You really don't get that?

292
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,340
I do, but...

293
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,620
What is it?

294
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,430
Not good news for him... Or Park.

295
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,270
Where's Park? Wilson's babysitting her.

296
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,060
Talking about the fact that she could have

297
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,460
permanent brain damage might bum her trip out a little bit.

298
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,120
A dark spot doesn't necessarily equal brain damage.

299
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,170
It could be a congenital malformation

300
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,060
connected with his blindness or a tumor.

301
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,280
A clot. Exactly.

302
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,290
We need to do another scan, but inject dye and figure out-

303
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,040
I said "a clot," <i>not "or a clot. "</i>

304
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
It's a clot.

305
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,680
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. <i>Good news for Park.</i>

306
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,630
I've never seen one present this large before.

307
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,510
It fits. When it was smaller,

308
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,890
it caused his initial disorientation and hallucinations.

309
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,880
<i>As it grew larger, the seizures.</i>

310
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,120
If left untreated, it leads to cerebral edema and death.

311
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,890
But what causes that and tooth loss?

312
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,590
Any hyper-coagulable state. Lupus?

313
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,400
I counter your lupus with Behcet's syndrome.

314
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,610
No, he doesn't have any of the earlier symptoms-

315
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,380
color blindness, abnormal visual fields or-

316
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,250
we've been ignoring his eyes because he's blind.

317
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,640
Well, if he wasn't before, he would be by now.

318
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,640
Confirm with an eye exam, start treatment with heparin for the clot.

319
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,150
Interferon and steroids for the Behcet's.

320
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,700
No, no!

321
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,750
Give me back my teeth! Park, listen. Park-

322
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,320
You're a tooth thief! No, no, no. Stop it, stop it!

323
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,550
Ki-ki-ki! Back on the couch.

324
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,480
What are you doing to this poor girl?

325
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,930
It's not what it looks like. She-oh!

326
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,420
She's tripping on acid.

327
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,440
Good lord, man, that's no way to treat a bad trip.

328
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,810
Put the chair down. You'll end up hurting the poor wee thing.

329
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,930
There you are.

330
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,900
Hello, darlin'.

331
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>I'm Thomas,</i> and this beautiful creature here is Blythe.

332
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,740
Is there anything we can do to help you? That rabbit stole my teeth.

333
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,760
Of course he did, but I'll tell you what he's done.

334
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,100
He's put them back again, and they're twice as nice as they used to be.

335
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,270
You can feel them if you like.

336
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,630
<i>See?</i>

337
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,320
Now, why don't we sit on this nice comfy couch,

338
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,580
have a nice cool drink and talk all about it.

339
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,090
Would you like that?

340
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,140
He's had some experience with things like this,

341
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,870
back in the day. As I recall, both of us-

342
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,710
Uh, not the time or the place, dear.

343
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,770
<i>There you are.</i>

344
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,790
See? There you are.

345
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,280
There's no way that guy's related to you.

346
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,110
There's fresh scarring and swelling in both fundi,

347
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,670
and a bleed on the left. House was right.

348
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,360
It's Behcet's syndrome.

349
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,260
Give it to me straight, Doc.

350
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,110
Am I ever gonna see again?

351
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,120
That's a little out of our jurisdiction.

352
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,640
We need to wrap a dressing over your eyes to keep the light out.

353
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,340
Not really a problem for me.

354
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,680
You might not see it, but your tissue does. It'll also help with the swelling.

355
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,290
I'll leave you in Dr. Adams' capable hands.

356
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,630
You think I'm an ass, don't you?

357
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,500
I can tell by your breathing.

358
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,480
Either you're angry or fat.

359
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,070
I think it's unfair that you're leading on a woman

360
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,680
who obviously loves and cares about you.

361
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,730
<i>I love and care about her too.</i>

362
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,120
But we just don't work together as a couple.

363
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,960
You need to tell her that. <i>I'm going to.</i>

364
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,990
But I just want to do it the right way.

365
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,530
<i>I don't want her to hate me.</i>

366
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,690
When she finds out you bought an engagement ring for another woman, that option is out the window.

367
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,700
It was gonna be for her.

368
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,760
What changed?

369
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,240
<i>She told me we were going on a break.</i>

370
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,280
I didn't even get a say in the matter.

371
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,820
She wanted you to be sure about your relationship.

372
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,490
I can see how that would be annoying.

373
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,890
I think I liked it better when you were just breathing angrily.

374
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,260
She still sees me as the same sheltered, blind geek she met in college.

375
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,830
Most of the time she acts more like my mother than my girlfriend.

376
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,730
I asked her to marry me.

377
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,280
She tells me I need to date somebody else first.

378
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,290
I'd rather she just dumped me. <i>At least that I can understand.</i>

379
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,740
So you were hurt so much you had to marry the next woman you met?

380
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,300
<i>Julie doesn't see me as I was,</i> but for who I am now.

381
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,880
She trusts me to make my own decisions and to help her with hers.

382
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,380
For the first time in my life, I have somebody who needs me...

383
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,710
Instead of the other way around.

384
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,780
Ah, she finally fell asleep. I think she'll be fine in a couple of hours.

385
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,660
How do you know about handling a bad acid trip?

386
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,010
Friends in your gardening club been experimenting again?

387
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,930
I was young once.

388
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,270
A little scrapbook that Thomas threw together.

389
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,350
He even has a couple of pictures of you as a child.

390
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,570
<i>And I've known Greg almost since he was born, you know.</i>

391
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,980
His father and I were like brothers. I was a Navy chaplain in those days.

392
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,050
I left the service in the late '60s.

393
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,570
<i>I don't think his dad ever forgave me</i> <i>for protesting the war.</i>

394
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,980
Of course, if he knew I'd got Blythe involved...

395
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,830
You protested the war? When?

396
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,190
You were a child. I didn't share my entire schedule with you.

397
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,620
We knew if we told you, you'd tell him, and he'd kill us both.

398
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,380
He was a marine. It was the ultimate betrayal.

399
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,710
Penultimate.

400
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,070
Sweetheart, I think we need to get back to the hotel.

401
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,580
Wilson, it's been a real pleasure.

402
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,340
You're right. Much too formal.

403
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,270
Come here, lad.

404
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,080
We're practically family now.

405
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,490
We'll see you boys tonight.

406
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,110
8:00 sharp.

407
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,710
I invited them out to dinner. Told them it was your idea.

408
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,610
Straw.

409
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,800
I know we agreed that whatever happened on break

410
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,610
would stay on break, and I don't expect you to talk about yours.

411
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,960
But I just want you to know that there was no one else.

412
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,830
I missed you so much,

413
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,520
I barely even saw my own friends.

414
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,860
I'm just so glad it's finally over. Are you okay?

415
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,770
<i>What's happening to him?</i>

416
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,850
Is he going to be okay? I'm going to need to discuss that with my colleagues.

417
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,520
We have to talk.

418
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,060
No, you need to rest. <i>I have to tell you about...</i>

419
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,210
About what happened on break.

420
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,760
<i>Later. You just lie back and relax-</i> stop it, Melissa!

421
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,300
Just stop telling me what I need,

422
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,840
<i>and listen for once, okay?</i>

423
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,780
How are you feeling? Embarrassed.

424
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,890
I'm still not sure what was real

425
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,670
or what I hallucinated.

426
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,720
Did you try to kiss me?

427
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,020
What about you?

428
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,150
He's stabilized for the moment.

429
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,690
<i>Coughing up blood.</i> <i>That doesn't really change anything.</i>

430
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,560
<i>Hemoptysis is a symptom of Behcet's.</i>

431
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,790
<i>Except our treatment should make him better, not worse.</i> <i>It could be doing both.</i>

432
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,780
Our treatment breaks down his clot in his head,

433
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,560
like it's supposed to, except a piece broke off

434
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,770
<i>and traveled to one of his arteries in his lungs.</i>

435
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,190
If anything, we need to increase the heparin to prevent further clots from forming.

436
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,830
If we do that and he starts hemorrhaging, we won't be able to stop the bleeding.

437
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,990
<i>If we don't do that, the next clot</i> could cause a heart attack or a stroke.

438
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,940
Park's way, he at least has a shot at living.

439
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,620
<i>CT his lungs to confirm, and up the dose.</i>

440
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,810
She's young and hot. She'll bounce back.

441
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,270
82 pounds.

442
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,480
How much weight I put on when my break ended the same way.

443
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,930
People were calling me Park-ing-lot.

444
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,110
Hmm... Almost 9:00.

445
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,600
I think your boy is gonna stand us up. No, no, he'll be here.

446
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,470
<i>Practically walked in on us having sex.</i>

447
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,020
God, if I saw my mother doing that, I'd claw my own eyes out.

448
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,640
Of course, she was nowhere near as attractive as you.

449
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,190
Horribly fat, as a matter of fact.

450
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,290
<i>Mother...</i>

451
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,240
Guy sleeping with my mother,

452
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,500
this is Dominika, my wife.

453
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,330
<i>It's so nice to be meeting you.</i>

454
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,610
Gregory tells me that you were born in Richmond, Virginia,

455
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,860
and your father was a tailor who stole from his clients.

456
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,590
James has persuaded me of the value

457
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,360
of openness and honesty in relationships.

458
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,030
We see people with disabilities all the time, but...

459
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,870
Seeing and understanding aren't always the same thing.

460
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,810
Are you talking to me or writing a Facebook post?

461
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,870
I'm saying we should have picked up on the degeneration in his eyes sooner.

462
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,740
We ignored them because we assumed they weren't even part of the equation.

463
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,650
<i>I also realized, intellectually,</i>

464
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:24,800
I may understand what it means to be disabled, but emotionally, I didn't have a clue.

465
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,590
<i>Apparently, his girlfriend didn't either.</i>

466
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,550
So you're back on his side? It's not a side. It's a perspective.

467
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,970
He just wants to be treated like an adult, make his own decisions.

468
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,640
I may not agree with all of them, but how the hell can I judge him?

469
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,160
I'm sure that's exactly what disabled people want, to be treated like completely foreign entities,

470
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,100
incapable of being judged and understood.

471
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,230
Park was right about the clot.

472
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,400
Hopefully the anticoagulants keep it from killing him.

473
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,780
So... She gets the couch on the odd nights, and I get the bed on evens.

474
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,230
<i>In exchange for a federal felony,</i>

475
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,430
<i>she gets a green card,</i> and I get a live-in maid.

476
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,960
Good for you.

477
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,970
The immigration policy in this country is a travesty.

478
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,920
It forces people to lie just so nice people can stay here.

479
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,650
Thank you... Dad.

480
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,710
I'm grateful you approve.

481
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,680
You should also know that I was not in Africa <i>the last year.</i>

482
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,490
You were in jail.

483
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,970
I've been reading the Princeton police blotter

484
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,920
ever since you moved here.

485
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,210
And I'm afraid I haven't been truthful with you either.

486
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,240
And I've wanted to tell you this for a very long time.

487
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,390
Thomas and I...

488
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,840
<i>We got married two months after your father passed away.</i>

489
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,830
Uh-huh. You understand, we didn't want 
you to think we were disrespecting

490
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,840
the memory of your father.

491
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,880
And... Is there another secret that you want to share with me?

492
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,590
No.

493
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,780
There's nothing you think might be relevant

494
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,120
to my life?

495
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,180
Like... What? I don't know.

496
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,410
Just off the top of my head,

497
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,870
something like I DNA-tested my dad and found that

498
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,630
he was not my biological father- you are.

499
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,720
That's impossible.

500
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,670
People lie. Birthmarks don't.

501
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,200
Oh, my God!

502
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,060
You told me he was a premie.

503
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,600
<i>This bloody lunatic is my son!</i>

504
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,040
He's not a lunatic.

505
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,620
All those years you could have told me. I could have done things.

506
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,030
That could have made a difference in the boy's life.

507
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,890
I think we should all just calm down. Look at him sitting there-

508
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,990
a pill-popping sociopath!

509
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,400
If you wanted to screw up his life, you couldn't have done it better.

510
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,410
He's got you there, mom.

511
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,810
He's one of the most well-respected doctors in the world.

512
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,700
He's saved more lives than you can count.

513
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,290
Now, you apologize to him, or I swear,

514
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,370
you will never see me again, Thomas.

515
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,680
I can't deal with this anymore.

516
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,260
<i>He's my son?</i>

517
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,600
I'm having a bloody breath of fresh air,

518
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,020
that's what I'm doing.

519
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,120
So, who's for dessert?

520
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,250
Somebody help me!

521
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,900
Uhh! Somebody-

522
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,450
Will? It's Dr. Adams and Dr. Chase.

523
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,860
We just need to know- My eyes! My eyes!

524
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,990
It feels like it's on fire!

525
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,430
It's not behcet's.

526
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,420
It doesn't necrotize tissue like this.

527
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,510
I think it's streptococcus pyogenes.

528
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,760
Except we've already treated him with broad spectrum antibiotics.

529
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,240
It shouldn't be spreading. It should be dying. Just means it's drug-resistant.

530
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,210
We need to remove what's left of his eyes before the gangrene sets in.

531
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,880
It's something that looks and acts like a bacteria but isn't one.

532
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,590
Could be viral. No, it couldn't.

533
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,590
There's no evidence of viral markers in the necrotized tissue.

534
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,720
Let me see that image you took last night of the clot in his lung.

535
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,910
That's not a piece of the clot from his brain.

536
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,710
That's the point of infection.

537
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,030
Mucormycosis.

538
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,790
<i>He breathed in the spores,</i> it's been growing and spreading ever since.

539
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,510
A fungal infection spreading this fast? <i>Kid's a diabetic.</i>

540
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,480
He already has a compromised immune system.

541
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,470
He's right. This sample from his eyes is crawling with it.

542
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,340
Treat with amphotericin b.

543
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,580
We treated him with gentamicin when we thought it was bacterial,

544
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,660
<i>which means the dose of amphotericin b we'll need</i>

545
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,880
to cure him will probably leave him deaf.

546
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,440
Sorry, I stopped listening after you said

547
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,090
<i>"the dose we'll need to cure him. "</i>

548
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,260
Blind and deaf?

549
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,130
I'd rather be dead.

550
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,930
You will be.

551
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,620
I can live with that.

552
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,840
You never did get my humor.

553
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,460
There's a chance your hearing won't be completely gone.

554
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,570
How much of a chance?

555
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,060
A small one.

556
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,200
<i>But a chance.</i>

557
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,540
I'm-I'm refusing treatment.

558
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,870
You don't know how hard things are already for me.

559
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,630
I can't handle any more.

560
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,590
I can't.

561
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,950
I'm here to apologize.

562
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,330
<i>I could have handled the news with more...</i>

563
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,710
Aplomb?

564
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,480
I have a son. That's great news.

565
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,670
What else did she tell you to say?

566
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,610
You're not a lunatic, you're not a mistake.

567
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,570
<i>I never liked your friend... My father.</i>

568
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,830
Well, he could be a bit intense at times.

569
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,820
But unlike you, I did respect him.

570
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,200
Do you respect your mother?

571
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,910
Well, we do have that in common.

572
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,820
And we all love her.

573
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,070
So we don't have much choice, do we?

574
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,310
Son, see you at dinner.

575
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,850
Will, it's me.

576
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,630
Let me guess.

577
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,140
The doctor who thinks I'm an ass
wants you to convince me to live.

578
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,720
Yes.

579
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,100
It won't work.

580
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,990
I KNOW.

581
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,360
So I won't.

582
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,430
Wow. You're that angry?

583
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,360
I've made enough decisions for you.

584
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,150
This is your life.

585
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,990
Why'd you come back?

586
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,040
Because I love you.

587
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,680
And I want to be with you for as long as I can.

588
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,330
Melissa, I'm so scared.

589
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,600
Me too.

590
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,580
I'll always love you.

591
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,710
Even if I was deaf?

592
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,350
Even if anything.

593
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,380
Is it working?

594
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,290
He's still very ill,

595
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,730
but if he keeps responding the way he has been,

596
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,310
he should be fine.

597
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,350
And his hearing? It's gone.

598
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,940
<i>We don't know yet if it'll be permanent.</i>

599
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,620
Melissa? Is that you?

600
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,490
We've been squeezing his hand, once for yes, twice for no.

601
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,140
Can I ask you something?

602
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,360
I completely understand if you squeeze no.

603
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,110
Will you marry me?

604
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,070
Don't leave me hanging, now. Yes.

605
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,120
Yes! Of course, yes!

606
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,850
I- I heard that. You said yes, right?

607
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,420
Yes! You said y-

608
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,440
How long are you gonna wait until you tell me?

609
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,010
I thought we already had the Santa Claus talk.

610
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,100
You don't think I saw you steal Thomas' fork from the restaurant?

611
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,620
 Why would I do that? For his DNA.

612
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,890
That's... That's...

613
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,320
Very observant of you.

614
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,750
See, you're more me than you pretend. You had to know for sure.

615
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,680
So you needed proof.

616
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,430
The fact that you haven't told me

617
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,250
can only mean...

618
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,550
He isn't your father either.

619
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm sorry.

620
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,660
You know what that means. Your mom's a slut.

621
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,960
That...

622
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,030
And... she's not as boring as I thought she was.

623
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,070
