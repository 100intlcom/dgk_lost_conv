1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,750
18 Months Earlier

2
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,510
Jack,this is hard for me.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,070
The Chinese have proof that you led the assault on their consulate.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,010
And now the Chinese want me.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,220
That's right.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,750
Listen to me very carefully.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,830
The man they sent to take you into custody has orders to kill you.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,990
Orders from who?

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,180
Someone in Logan's camp.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,890
Bill Spaulding, Secret Service.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,180
I have orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,890
I intend to execute those orders.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,410
Jack!

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,300
He's dead.

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,810
Oh,Jack!

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,300
Give me the epinephrine.

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,510
I hope it's not too late.

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,620
He really looks dead.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,030
Come on,Jack!

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,660
Come on,Jack,damn it!

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,640
Hey.

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,000
All right,Chloe,I need you to run interference with the local coroner.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,570
Make sure their database synchs up with Jack's information.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,970
That won't cover the autopsy.

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,220
There's not going to be an autopsy.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,640
They wanted Jack dead,

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,480
now he's dead.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,850
Mr. President, you saved my life.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,690
I'm only sorry it came to this.

31
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,820
I just wanted to let you know that I was out.

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,600
I'm glad.

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,270
Jack,you do understand that when you hang up,

34
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,730
for all intents and purposes,

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,460
Jack Bauer is dead.

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,430
I understand that,sir.

37
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,600
Mr. President,

38
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,380
it's been an honor.

39
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,750
The following takes place between 7am and 8am

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,960
mojave,california

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,060
Jim Nichols!

42
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,510
You're on pump number one.

43
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,410
Sterling Rush,Patrick Priest.

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,010
You're on pump number four.

45
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,510
Phil Stone, Greg Nelson,you're on pump five.

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,310
Sorry,guys,that's all I got today.

47
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,770
Hey,Frank?

48
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,510
Look,I-I know I promised you work today,but...

49
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,270
pump seven went off-line last night.

50
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,970
That's all right. I'll try again tomorrow.

51
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,910
Yeah,tomorrow'll be much better.

52
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,610
See you tomorrow.

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,860
LA,canifornia

54
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,170
The sun is shining,

55
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,110
but the air is cool at President Logan's retreat,

56
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,420
where Russian President Yuri Suvarov

57
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,710
is expected to arrive later this morning.

58
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,570
Everything worked for me,

59
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,010
up until the chapter on your first campaign.

60
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm sorry,but I think it's a little long-winded,

61
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,610
and I think that we can cut that down by half.

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,910
So why don't we start with paragraph...

63
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,010
You didn't hear a word I just said,did you?

64
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,710
Yes,I was listening.

65
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,210
No,you weren't.

66
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,410
You're right.

67
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,450
Are you okay?

69
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,910
I can use a break.

70
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,910
What's going on?

71
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,170
What do you mean?

72
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,710
I mean you've been distracted ever since you got to Los Angeles.

73
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,670
I don't know,it's...

74
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,010
It's like you're somewhere else.

75
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,410
Writing my memoirs...

76
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,210
maybe it's put me in a melancholy mood.

77
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,810
Is that all it is?

78
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,110
Yeah.

79
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,610
David... I'm your brother.

80
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,810
Whatever it is,you can tell me.

81
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,410
It's all right,really.

82
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,810
Okay.

83
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,810
Well,then let's get back to work.

84
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,360
One more chapter, and we'll take a break.

85
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,300
Why don't we jump down to,um,Chapter Six?

86
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,210
There's going to be a lot of questions

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,410
about your relationship with Sherry.

88
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,110
David!

89
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,370
No,no,no,no,no...

90
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,110
Get help!

91
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,160
Stay with me.

92
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,550
Stay with me.

93
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,110
Get help!

94
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,920
Presidential Retreat Hidden Valley

95
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,010
Walt.

96
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,070
My chair?

97
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,010
Don't worry,Mr. President.

98
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,910
I had it adjusted.

99
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,770
Good.

100
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,160
Adjusted? Wait a minute.

101
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,470
What are we talking about here?

102
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,910
Yuri Suvarov is over six feet.

103
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,270
Russian President can't be looking down on the President

104
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,310
of the United States when the cameras roll.

105
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,270
That's a risky proposition,Walt.

106
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,710
- The press finds out about it,and... - They won't.

107
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,870
Don't underestimate the power of the image,Mike.

108
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,710
Stalin and Churchill, they both sat for FDR at Yalta.

109
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,870
This is the defining moment of my administration.

110
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,610
We have to make sure that the media presents it the right way.

111
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,510
I'll get it.

112
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,410
Yeah,put him through.

113
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,810
Have you checked on my wife?

114
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,610
Ah,she's still getting ready.

115
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,410
She'll be fine,sir.

116
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,110
I'm in contact with Dr. Hill.

117
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,210
I'd feel better if you would check on her yourself.

118
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,210
She cannot have one of her meltdowns today.

119
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,370
Look...

120
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,710
you're the only one she listens to,Walt.

121
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,810
Yes,sir.

122
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,910
Thank you.

123
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,110
Mike?

124
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,110
Mike,what is it?

125
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,210
David Palmer's been assassinated.

126
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,010
What?!

127
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,610
It just happened.

128
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,210
Oh,my God.

129
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,010
Where?

130
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,410
In L.A.

131
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,010
I don't believe this.

132
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,970
Mr. President,uh,

133
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,510
CTU is standing by to brief you directly.

134
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,810
Whenever you're ready.

135
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,710
Make sure LAPD sets up a hard perimeter.

136
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,870
They're sending everyone they've got.

137
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,710
- Where are they on witnesses? - Nowhere yet.

138
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,870
Who's running search and sweep?

139
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,710
Secret Service,but they're shorthanded.

140
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,870
Narrow the search area.

141
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,410
Make sure ballistics runs a line-of-fire trajectory.

142
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,210
Sir,President Logan's ready.

143
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,810
I'll call ballistics.

144
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,610
Put the President through.

145
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,210
Yes sir,go ahead.

146
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,410
Mr. President.

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,510
Bill...

148
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,160
not to diminish the loss that we're all feeling right now,

149
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,610
but I'm expecting the Russian President very soon,so...

150
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,810
let's say what needs to be said.

151
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,010
Of course,sir.

152
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,210
Have you arrested the person who did this?

153
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,470
Not yet,sir.

154
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,910
Then what do you have?

155
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,710
Sir,the damage inflicted by the single shot indicates

156
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,870
that President Palmer was hit by a 308-caliber bullet

157
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,310
fired from an adjacent building.

158
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,110
We've initiated an interagency protocol,level five...

159
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,470
Don't...

160
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,110
don't give me protocols,Bill.

161
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,270
Give me results.

162
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,710
Whoever did this,I want them dead or in custody

163
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,110
by the time the Russians get here.

164
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,470
Yes,Mr. President.

165
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,810
But until we know more,

166
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,810
I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty,sir.

167
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,970
No

168
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,970
Absolutely not.

169
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,270
Mr. President,we can't discount the possibility

170
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,110
that this attack is somehow connected to the arms agreement.

171
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,770
A former president was assassinated 15 miles from where you are.

172
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,410
And I'm sure I don't need to explain the significance of this day.

173
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,310
Do you realize what kind of

174
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,270
political and economic capital

175
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,910
I've spent just to get the Russians to the table?

176
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,310
If we call this off, they won't come back.

177
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,110
Spencer?

178
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,310
Spencer?

179
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,670
What?

180
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,210
Get out of my bed.

181
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,810
Yeah.

182
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,210
I had a good time last night,too.

183
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,710
I'm serious. This was a mistake.

184
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,870
Get out of here.

185
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,310
What do you mean,a mistake?

186
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,870
We had a great time.

187
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,510
I don't get involved with people who work for me.

188
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,010
It's too late for that.

189
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,370
I would appreciate it if you didn't

190
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,670
tell everybody at work about this.

191
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,410
I don't want everyone thinking I'm some kind of slut.

192
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,910
Believe me,no one's ever going to think that.

193
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,810
What's that supposed to mean?

194
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,810
You should lighten up,you know?

195
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,410
You'll live longer.

196
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,870
What are you doing?

197
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,610
When you quit overanalyzing the situation,

198
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,270
I think you're gonna find out

199
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,410
that you and I are pretty good together

200
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,410
So I'm telling you advce,yes.

201
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,910
Yes,what?

202
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,210
I'll let you buy me dinner.

203
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,370
Get me drunk.

204
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,710
Have your way with me.

205
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,210
Anytime you want.

206
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,610
You know,um,arrogance doesn't turn me on.

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,120
I've read that some women respond to it,

208
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,410
but I'm just letting you know,I don't.

209
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,670
What is it?

210
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,810
President Palmer's been shot.

211
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,010
He's dead.

212
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,570
Who is it?

213
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,010
It's me,Frank.

214
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,610
I saw your truck outside.

215
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,870
I thought you were on today.

216
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,210
Ned didn't need me this morning.

217
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,810
It's so terrible, what happened.

218
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,610
Are you okay?

219
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,210
Yeah,I'm fine.

220
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,370
Come on,I'm making breakfast.

221
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,430
Okay.

222
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,510
Frank's gonna join us.

223
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,570
Great.

224
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,450
Derek,stop it.

225
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,220
Morning.

226
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,010
Use a glass,please.

227
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,900
Here.

228
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,610
Excuse me.

229
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,730
Can I ask you something,Frank?

230
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,110
Yeah,sure.

231
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,940
That rig in Alaska you worked on,

232
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,560
what was that called again?

233
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,530
The Albatross.

234
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,190
And you were thereast year?

235
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,490
Yeah,why?

236
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,660
It's funny.

237
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,430
My friend's got a brother who's been working on that rig for five years

238
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,420
and he's never heard of any Frank Flynn.

239
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,040
It's a big platform.

240
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah,well,my friend's brother says everyone knows everyone.

241
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,510
What is this,an interrogation?

242
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,660
I just don't like being lied to.

243
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,640
Derek.

244
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,100
No,it's all right.

245
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,260
No one's lying to you,Derek.

246
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,450
really?

247
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,360
When you're out there,a lot of the guys just use nicknames.

248
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,840
Yeah.

249
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,250
What's your friend's brother's name?

250
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,760
Eat your breakfast.

251
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,330
Yeah,I'm not hungry.

252
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,540
Sorry.

253
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,220
He's just kind of protective of me.

254
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,330
But it's the best thing in the world for him to have a man around here.

255
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,600
Look,what he said about me and Alaska...

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,100
You don't owe me an explanation.

257
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,160
I figure if you had wanted I me about your past you would have told me already.

258
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,460
I trust my instincts.

259
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,820
And I trust you.

260
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,620
Former President David Palmer was killed just a short while ago.

261
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,700
Now,no information has been released to the public athis time,

262
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,030
but an independent source has verified that Palmer was in Los Angeles

263
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,020
visiting his brother and former White...

264
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,040
Bill will call if he needs us,you know that.

265
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,170
No,he won't.

266
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,720
Authorities are remaining very tightlipped as the

267
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,050
LAPD and Secret Service seal off the area,

268
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,250
and there has been no word on whether this was an accident...

269
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,700
It's not our job.Not anymore.

270
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,780
This is different.

271
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,880
Come on,Michelle.

272
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,150
I'm just as upset as you are.

273
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,590
David Palmer meant a lot to me,too.

274
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,470
But there are other people at CTU who can handle this.

275
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,880
No one who was active during the other attempts onis life.

276
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,840
Tony,you and I worked up suspect profiles.

277
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,160
We ran scenarios.

278
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,750
And they aneth our records on file.

279
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,740
They don't have our experience.

280
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,760
I never once regretted our decision to leave CTU.

281
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,940
But I don't want to look back on today and realize I could have helped.

282
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,420
We're running a business here, Michelle.

283
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,820
Rick Rosen is expecting us to make a presentation in less than an hour.

284
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,300
You can handle the meeting on your own.

285
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,310
Michelle,don't do this.

286
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,590
It's Rick. Leave me a message.

287
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,100
Yeah,Rick,it's Tony Almeida.

288
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,070
Look,I just wanted to call you and let you know

289
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,080
that Michelle's not gonna be able to make our meeting today.

290
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,920
She had to go someplace.

291
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,690
On second thought...

292
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,890
I'm going with her.

293
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,800
Michelle

294
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,910
Michelle

295
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,580
Did Jepson brief you on what's happening?

296
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,860
Said there was a car bombing.

297
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,370
Two former CTU agents were hit.

298
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,610
Yeah,their names are Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.

299
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,070
You knew them?

300
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,060
Yeah.

301
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,230
We're data-mining for a connection between them and President Palmer.

302
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,050
I sent the parameters to your screen.

303
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,990
I'll get on it.

304
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,570
Yeah?

305
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,100
It's Edgar. Are you coming in?

306
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,440
I just,I paged on a level five protocol,

307
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,690
of crse I'm coming in.

308
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,160
I wanted to give you aveeads up before you got here.

309
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,180
Heads up?

310
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,430
It's bad,Chloe.

311
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,760
Yeah,President Palmer was gunned down.

312
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,410
I'd say that's pretty bad.

313
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,510
It's not just him.

314
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,410
What are you talking about?

315
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,230
Someone planted a bomb in Michelle Dessler's car.

316
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,860
What?

317
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,560
Michelle's dead.

318
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,130
He Tony's not doing too good.

319
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,550
Doesn't make any sense.

320
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,070
They were retired.

321
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,230
Buchanan thinks it's lind to Palmer somehow.

322
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,290
We're cross-referencing everything we have on Palmer with Tony and Michelle,

323
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,150
to see if we can find a connection,

324
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,100
anything they may have had in common.

325
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,240
Chloe?

326
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,990
Go.

327
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,860
- Chloe? - I'll call you back.

328
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,900
- Why?  - I'll call you back!

329
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,670
Chloe?

330
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,520
Since I don't have to go to work today,

331
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,150
I can take care of the fence out back if you want.

332
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,570
Oh,that'd be great.

333
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,690
I can't thank you enough for all the work you've down around here.

334
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,100
It's at least I could do.

335
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,150
Excuse me.

336
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,110
Yeah?

337
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,680
Jack,I know this isn't protocol.

338
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,720
Please don't hang up on me. I need your help.

339
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,250
Uh,hold on, I can barely hear you.

340
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,140
I don't have a very good signal.Excuse me.

341
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,970
What is it?

342
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,980
They got Tony and Michelle. Michelle is dead.

343
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,730
Tony is in critical condition.

344
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,860
Now they're gonna kill me.

345
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,520
What are you talking about?

346
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,910
There's four people that know you're alive.

347
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,750
Three of them are down. Jack,

348
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,030
I'm the only one left.

349
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,160
This has to be about you.

350
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,080
It's the only thing the four of us have in common.

351
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,330
What happened to Tony and Michelle.

352
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,960
There was a car bomb.

353
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,010
There was a guy outside my apartment and he was chasing me.

354
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,590
Oh,my God.

355
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,790
Where is he now?

356
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,120
I think I lost him.

357
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,950
I'm at a pay phone. I dumped my cell phone.

358
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,170
I don't know what to do now.

359
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,900
Chloe,you need to go dark.

360
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,070
That means zero contact with anyone.

361
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,990
Even CTU?

362
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,090
Especially CTU.

363
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,310
Whoever's behind this is probably monitori them.

364
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,250
Someone out ther knows I'm still alive.

365
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,400
Who?

366
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,460
I don't know,but that's what we need to find out.

367
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,840
Right now,I want you to head north out of Los Angeles.

368
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,000
There's abandoned oil refinery at Variel and Topanga.

369
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,540
I want you to wait for me there

370
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,950
You can take cover by the large storage tanks at the north end of the field.

371
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,380
You're coming to L.A.?

372
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,580
Give me about a half an ho.

373
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,970
Okay. Thanks.

374
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,450
Tony Almeida is being medevaced in.

375
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,550
We have a trauma team standing by to receive him in medical.

376
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,280
You're bringing him to CTU?

377
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,640
If there's a second attempt on his life,we can't protect him in a hospital.

378
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,920
This doesn't track.

379
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,380
Michelle and Tony have been inactive for over a year.

380
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,360
Who'd want them dead?

381
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,150
Whoever wanted Palmer dead.

382
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,110
So we're assuming they're connected.

383
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,070
The timing was too close to write it off as a coincidence.

384
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,040
There is a connection.

385
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,580
Let's find it.

386
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,210
Sir,the DOD liaison is here.

387
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,750
I need to set her up with the security protocols for the summit.

388
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,970
I'll take care of it.

389
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,600
You have your assignments.

390
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,470
Send updates directly to my screen.

391
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,520
Where is she?

392
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,980
She just cleared security.

393
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,960
Audrey

394
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,810
Bill

395
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,010
Must be hard for you to be back here.

396
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,630
Thank you,Bill. I'm fine.

397
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,770
I'm sorry about Michelle.

398
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,200
Walt Cummings briefed me on the way over here.

399
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,900
He said that you wanted to postpone the signing of the treaty.

400
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,460
President Logan is making a mistake.

401
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,240
I don't disagree.

402
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,320
Have you let him know that?

403
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,230
He's the President,Bill.

404
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,580
It's his call.

405
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,660
That's what I'm afraid of.

406
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,780
He wants me to make sure that your top

407
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,630
priority is still security for the summit.

408
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,790
Station Five is set up for you.

409
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,460
When you're situated,we'll go over the revised security protocol.

410
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,040
Great. Thank you,Bill.

411
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,620
David Palmer was a man of truth and of honor.

412
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,870
And his influence will be felt for generations to come.

413
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,710
Our nation grieves for its loss.

414
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,550
Martha and I offer our deepest sympathy.

415
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,610
You look beautiful, Mrs. Logan.

416
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,610
I look like a wedding cake.

417
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,820
Let's start over.

418
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,320
Oh,you can get that.

419
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,800
Is Mrs. Logan ready?

420
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,860
Not quite.

421
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,340
You didn't tell her about David Palmer?

422
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,070
No.

423
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,440
Thank you.

424
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,290
She'll take it hard when she finds out.

425
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,480
They've been friends for a long time.

426
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,950
You don't have to talk about me like I'm not here.

427
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,390
Excuse us,Evelyn.

428
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,580
Martha...

429
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,300
I...

430
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,780
I'm sorry.Look,I know...

431
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,830
I know I'm late. I'm sorry.

432
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,430
I just... I'm having a bad hair day.

433
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,610
Martha...

434
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,060
I've got som very bad news.

435
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,930
But...

436
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,880
- it's not Charles, is it? - No,

437
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,140
he's fine.

438
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,670
He wanted to tell you himself...

439
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,040
Well...

440
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,620
what? Walt,Walt...

441
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,530
What...

442
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,390
What is it?

443
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,580
David Palmer was assassinated.

444
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,410
No...

445
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,450
I'm sorry.

446
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,070
I know how close you were.

447
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,440
When did this happen?

448
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,790
Less than an hour ago.

449
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,500
This morning?!

450
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,470
I...

451
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,280
I...

452
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,630
I have to talk to Charles.

453
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,760
He's doing damage control,

454
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,700
trying to keep this om pushing the treaty off the front page.

455
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,920
No,no,oh,no,I have to talk to him now.

456
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,320
- No. He's doing a press conference... - No!

457
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,100
Martha!

458
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,710
Martha!

459
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,750
Agent North!

460
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,120
Call John,tell him not to let Mrs. Logan anywhere near the stage.

461
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,200
Yeah,give me Dr. Hill.

462
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,160
As I look back upon the deeds of David Palmer-

463
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,710
not only one of this country's greatest leaders,

464
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,810
but one of this world's greatest men...

465
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,050
Mrs. Logan

466
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,400
Let go of me.

467
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,310
Let go of me.

468
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,230
- Let go of me! Let go! - I can't let you...

469
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,220
...to President Palmer's entire family.

470
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,870
And to them,I also pledge the full resources of this great nation

471
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,660
to find and to punish those responsible.

472
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,170
No,no,no. Get away from me.

473
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,590
- I can't let you go out there. - Don't don't touch me.

474
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,650
Don't touch me.

475
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,720
Get away from me now,or I swear

476
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,890
I will have your family eating dog food out of a can.

477
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,670
Martha,stop it!

478
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,770
Mike,damn it,I am the First Lady!

479
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,450
Tell your storm trooper to stay away from me!

480
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,790
I need to talk to my husband.

481
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,210
Martha,look...

482
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,650
he's in the middle of a press conference right now.

483
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,330
Hundreds of millions of people are watching him live.

484
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,190
What is it, Martha? What is so urgent?

485
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,560
Maybe I can help.

486
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,590
Tell Charles I want to see him when he's done.

487
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,480
all right

488
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,840
Don't shoot me.

489
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,540
What the hell are you doing here?

490
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,450
I'm sorry I followed you. I'm just...

491
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,070
I'm just worried about my mother.

492
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,450
Get up.

493
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,850
Get up.

494
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,840
Get up.

495
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,270
Damn it!

496
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,160
Come here. You're going with me.

497
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,610
This is none of my business.

498
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,450
This is none of my business. I won't tell anyone.

499
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,870
Just let me go,okay?

500
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,240
I really wish I could,kid but I can't.

501
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,390
You're going with me.

502
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,680
Now get in the helicopter.

503
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,600
Frank,Frank, come on,please.

504
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,140
Move!

505
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,330
Prep a sterile cranial field.

506
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,260
I need access to the right hemisphere.


508
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,210
I need to talk to Tony before he goes into surgery.

509
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,500
He's non-responsive.

510
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,110
According to the paramedic on the chopper,

511
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,150
he suffered a closed head trauma that's affected his speech.

512
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,650
They're going to try to insert a stint to relieve the pressure.

513
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,880
Will he be able to talk then?

514
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,560
The doctor doesn't know.

515
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,080
I want real time updates on his progress.

516
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,140
We need Tony to explain this.

517
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:20,830
What is it?

518
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,400
I may have found a connection between Tony and David Palmer.

519
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,600
Tony's phone records?

520
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,700
One call in particular.

521
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,680
The last time Tony spoke to President Palmer

522
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,570
was the day that Jack Bauer was killed.

523
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,410
Pull the transcripts?

524
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,710
I tried,but the files were corrupted.

525
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,010
What's he hiding?

526
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,430
Something about Jack's death.

527
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,380
Are you kidnapping me?

528
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,550
No!

529
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,670
Then where are you taking me?

530
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,930
Los Angeles.

531
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,010
Why?

532
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,650
Because I couldn't leave you back there.

533
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,830
You'd have gone to the police, and I couldn't let that happen.

534
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,860
But what is this about?

535
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,260
Who are you?

536
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,220
Someone who's not supposed to still be alive.

537
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,230
Like some kind of witness relocation thing?

538
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,120
Yeah,something like that.

539
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,120
So you were a criminal.

540
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,990
No.

541
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,430
Listen,Derek the less you know about me,the better.

542
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,210
So what are you going to do with me?

543
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,740
Hello?

544
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,740
Diane,it's me.

545
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,330
Frank,I can just barely hear you.

546
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,190
What's that noise?

547
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,300
I'm in a helicopter with Derek.

548
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,170
Derek?

549
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,320
Yeah. He's fine.

550
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,950
Listen,Diane,I need you to pick him up hiin Los Angeles for me.

551
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,150
Why is he with you?

552
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,230
I'll explain everything as soon as I see you.

553
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,500
Frank,Frank, what are you doing with Derek?

554
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,030
Diane,please just do this for me.

555
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,150
I need you to get in a car a and start driving now.

556
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,880
You're scaring me.

557
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,380
Heane,do you remember this morning,

558
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,950
when you said that you trusted me?

559
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,390
Right now,I need you to trust me.

560
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,610
Derek's going to be fine. Just do what I say.

561
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,740
I need you to get in a car and start driving towards Los Angeles.

562
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,270
Don't talk to anybody about this.

563
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,300
And I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

564
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,610
Frank?

565
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,160
I don't understand.

566
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,400
You're just going to hand me back to my mom?

567
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,970
I thought you were worried about me going to the police.

568
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,520
I have something to do in Los Angeles.

569
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,160
Once it's done, it doesn't matter.

570
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,120
How are you doing?

571
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,210
I'm sorry,Charles.

572
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,110
I didn't mean to make a scene.

573
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,330
I know that.

574
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,750
Dr. Hill says you haven't been taking your medication.

575
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,930
I don't like the way the pills make me feel.

576
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,160
Martie...

577
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,400
we just need to get through today.

578
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,480
Charles...

579
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,800
the reason that I needed to...

580
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,620
- to talk to you... - What is it,honey?

581
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,610
Go ahead.

582
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,180
I think...

583
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,970
that David was killed because of

584
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,600
something he was about to tell me.

585
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,540
come on

586
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,030
What are you talking about ?

587
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,680
He called me yesterday.

588
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,020
He said he wanted to meet with me.

589
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,810
Meet with you about what?

590
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,560
He said it concerned national security

591
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,320
and that it involved you.

592
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,250
- Me? - Yes.

593
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,460
What else did he say?

594
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,930
Just that he would explain when he saw me.

595
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,940
If this was so important,

596
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,400
why wouldn't he have called me himself?

597
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,340
Well,Charles,you shut him out of this

598
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,270
White House about 18 months ago.

599
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,190
You know that.

600
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,100
He had no real access.

601
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,300
Except through you.

602
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,630
You don't believe me.

603
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,790
I didn't say that.

604
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,050
You didn't need to.

605
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,570
Martha...

606
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,630
I am not making this up.

607
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,800
I am not crazy

608
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,250
- I am not a fool Charles! - Martha...

609
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,770
it's going to be all right.

610
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,580
I'm not making this up.

611
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,110
All right.

612
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,230
I'll have Walt look into it.

613
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,020
You will?

614
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,200
Yes.

615
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,260
Thank you.

616
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,390
But right now

617
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,040
President Suvarov and his wife are arriving in one hour.

618
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,870
I need you to be there.

619
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,190
I need you by my side.

620
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,490
I'm sorry.

621
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,910
Was she all right?

622
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,460
No,Walt,she's not all right.

623
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,520
She's having another one of her delusions.

624
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,200
She thinks that David Palmer was killed

625
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,060
because of something he was about to tell her.

626
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,110
She's imagining she's in the middle of

627
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,830
one of her own conspiracy theories.

628
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,510
Well,what should we do?

629
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,070
Nothing.

630
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,040
Spenser,have you talked to Chloe this morning?

631
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,340
No. Why?

632
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,930
She left her apartment about a half hour ago.

633
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,070
She should've been here by now.

634
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,240
It's probably traffic.

635
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,930
She commutes against traffic.

636
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,900
And she's not answering her cell phone.

637
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,380
I wouldn't worry about it.

638
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,750
She sounded strange when I talked to her.

639
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,050
She always sounds strange.

640
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,060
I'm gonna call Adamson,have him run a locate on her cell.

641
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,270
Don't waste his time,Edgar. She's fine.

642
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,530
I'm sure of it.

643
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,350
- What makes you so sure? - It doesn't matter.

644
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,480
It does to me.

645
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,100
I saw her,okay?

646
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,740
Uh,about half an hour ago.

647
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,860
- But I thought you said... - Forget what I said.

648
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,270
- Where did you see her? - Man...

649
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,580
do you really need me to spell it out for you?

650
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,930
Don't worry about Chloe.

651
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,710
She's fine,all right?

652
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,830
You can just let me out here.

653
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,680
There's nothing here.

654
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,940
Just pull over,please.

655
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,580
I still don't understand what this is all about,Frank.

656
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,360
Will you please tell me what's going on?

657
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,870
Please?

658
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,710
A friend of mine's in trouble.

659
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,420
I needed to pick her up in a hurry.

660
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,970
This is the only way I could get to her quick enough.

661
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,960
Chloe.

662
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,520
Jack!

663
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,730
- Are you okay? - I'm fine!

664
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,160
What's happening?

665
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,920
Why would anyone want to kill the people who know you're alive?

666
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,910
I don't know yet, but we're gonna find out.

667
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,620
Right now,I need to get access to

668
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,160
CTU's archives from a secure location

669
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,600
can you help me do that?

670
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,430
I can't do it from my laptop.

671
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,500
But there's a research loft at Cal Tech.

672
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,700
I can get us in.

673
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,580
Who's that?

674
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,320
I'll explain as soon as we're in the car.

675
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,500
I don't have a car. I took a cab.

676
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,950
Come on,get in the helicopter. We got to go.

677
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,860
Derek,get back in.

678
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,080
- Jack? - What?

679
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,250
It's them.

680
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,870
How did they find me?

681
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,720
I don't think they ever lost you.

682
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,410
Come on.

683
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,890
What's going on,Frank?

684
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,940
Who are they?

685
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,570
What are we waiting for? Take off!

686
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,030
We're not at speed!

687
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,810
We're not gonna make it. Get out! Get out now,

688
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,500
and stay by the side of the helicopter!

689
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,060
Here! Take him and go into the refinery!

690
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,650
Find somewhere to hide! Move!

691
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,080
i can't see anything

692
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,580
Double back,cut him off.

693
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,100
Go through the smoke screen; I'm going around.

694
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,350
go over here

695
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,180
Hold your fire,Chloe!

696
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,160
Jack,what are you doing? Let's get out of here.

697
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,880
Chloe,take Derek and walk away.

698
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,050
Walk away now!

699
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,070
At the rate you're bleeding out,

700
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,430
you're not gonna make it unless you get medical attention.

701
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,810
You tell me what I want to know,

702
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,020
and I will get you to a hospital,you understand me?

703
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,250
Do you understand me?

704
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,420
Yeah.

705
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,460
Four people knew I was alive.

706
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,150
This morning, you tried to take them out.

707
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,150
Why ?

708
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,910
Palmer was my... primary target.

709
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,440
They only cared about Palmer.

710
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,970
The others were just a diversion...

711
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,950
...to set you up,make it looks like you did it.

712
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,020
Why'd they want to kill Palmer?

713
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,500
To keep him from talking.

714
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,810
They had to shut him up.

715
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,760
What did he know?

716
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,750
I wasn't given that information.

717
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,020
Only hired...

718
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,040
to take out the principle.

719
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,000
You're the one that killed Palmer.

720
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,750
Yeah.

721
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,160
Who's behind this?

722
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,280
I got my orders through a codes of silence

723
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,400
We never use names, you know that.

724
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,960
That's all I know.Take me to a hospital.

725
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah.
