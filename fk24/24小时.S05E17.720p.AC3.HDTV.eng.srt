1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,500
Ctu is being absorbed by the department of homeland security,

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,500
and Christopher Henderson remains an open protocol.

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,400
Ms. Raines signed a detailed statement

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,900
documenting the numerous missteps made today by CTU,

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,600
and by you,in particular.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,500
I don't understand,

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,400
why am I staying and everybody else is being let go?

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,600
Because ms. Raines requested that you keep your position.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,600
I had to keep Karen from replacing you,

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,700
that's why I signed the document,

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,900
I didn't have a choice.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,200
Why were those men trying to kill you?

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,800
David had a source inside the white house.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,700
Who's the source?

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Mrs. Logan's assistant.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,600
I have proof about who's behind everything that's happened today.

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,900
Someone killed David...

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,300
and they just tried to kill me.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,600
-I have to go now... -give me what I need!

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,500
They kidnapped my little girl.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,000
Evelyn.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,400
I promise you we're going to get your daughter back.

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,500
I already told them I wouldn't give up any information

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
until I have my daughter.

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,600
We need Henderson alive;

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,900
do not shoot to kill.

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,300
Did you bring what we discussed?

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,000
I have the evidence with me.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,400
I want my daughter.

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,300
She's moving.

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,800
Give me the evidence, Evelyn.

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,400
Now.

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,000
Wayne, I didn't get him

34
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,500
if you got a shot, take it!

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,400
Chloe, it's Jack,

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,900
Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car!

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,100
Do you have him on satellite?

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,300
We can't lose him!

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Evelyn's been hit.

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,100
It's not serious,

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
but it's gonna have to be dressed.

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,100
Evelyn, you've got your daughter back,

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
now tell me what I need to know.

44
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,500
Who is behind this?

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,800
Is it the vice President?

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,200
The vice President has nothing to do with this!

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,300
You promised me you would control the situation.

48
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,200
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir.

49
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,000
Bauer and Wayne Palmer won't be around

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,700
long enough to tell anybody else what they know.

51
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,600
I will not let you down.

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,500
See that you don't.

53
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,050
The following takes place between 11Pm and 12Am

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,700
Okay, Evelyn, I need you to stay focused.

55
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,700
The recording of the phone call

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,500
that you made between President Logan and Henderson

57
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,200
is in a safety deposit box

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,000
which bank?

59
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,800
Which bank?

60
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,400
City trust and savings in agoura hills.

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,200
Where's the key?

62
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,000
My Jacket pocket.

63
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,200
Mom?

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,600
It's all right,sweetheart,

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,600
your mom's going to be fine.

66
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,300
She's going to be fine, okay?

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,300
Jack, you heard what they said.

68
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,500
We have to get off this road,

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,900
there are military patrols everywhere.

70
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,900
There's a motel up there on the right.

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Turn in there.

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,300
I want to go home.

73
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,700
We're gonna get you home, honey.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We're gonna get you home.

75
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,800
Wayne, can you get us a room.

76
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,700
I'll keep watch.

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,100
Make sure you keep pressure on the wound,

78
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I'll be right back.

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,900
-Hello? -Audrey, it's Jack.

80
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,500
Have you got Henderson on satellite yet?

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,500
No, Chloe wasn't able to reposition in time.

82
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,300
Damn it!

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,300
Are you still on a secure line?

84
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,500
Yes. Why,what's going on?

85
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,200
Evelyn didn't implicate Gardner.

86
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,000
She implicated President Logan.

87
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,800
Oh, my god, Jack.

88
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,100
Logan? Are you sure?

89
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
She said he was responsible for everything that happened today,

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,600
starting with providing the terrorists with the nerve gas.

91
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,200
That's what David Palmer found out.

92
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,200
That's why they killed him.

93
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,900
Are you saying that

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,100
President Logan ordered Palmer's assassination?

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Henderson gave the order.

96
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,400
But Evelyn says she has evidence

97
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
that shows that President Logan was complicit.

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
What kind of evidence?

99
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,400
She recorded a conversation earlier this morning

100
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,100
between Henderson and President Logan.

101
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
She put it in a safety deposit box in a bank.

102
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
We're on our way to get it now.

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,500
Jack, the city is under martial law.

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,500
I know. I need you to upload every military checkpoint to my pda

105
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,100
so we can navigate our way around them.

106
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
All right,I'll take care of that.

107
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,800
Audrey, as soon as I have the recording,

108
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,300
we're going to have to involve your father.

109
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
We need someone in the government,

110
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,400
someone credible,

111
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,300
to present the evidence.

112
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,400
All right.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
He's on his way back from a summit in japan.

114
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll call him on the plane.

115
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,300
Okay. Make sure you leave CTU before you do anything.

116
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,100
You don't think that they can be trusted?

117
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,800
Right now,we can't trust anyone.

118
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Logan will have every federal law enforcement agency,

119
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,800
the military,

120
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,100
all at his disposal.

121
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,000
And he will use them to try and stop us.

122
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,300
Don't fill your father in on the particulars.

123
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
Just try and set up the meeting.

124
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,100
I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording.

125
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,800
-All right, I'll upload those checkpoints. -Yeah.

126
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,200
Wayne?

127
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,400
The bank manager was listed.

128
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,100
That's his address,

129
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,800
he's not far.

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Good. Let's get them in the room.

131
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,900
Hey... we need to get inside now.

132
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,500
Come on, it's okay.

133
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,500
Give me your arm.

134
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,200
you can sit right here, okay?

135
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Okay. Lie down here on the bed.

136
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,800
I'm sorry, but it's not safe enough to take you to a hospital yet.

137
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,400
Let me see,let me see.

138
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,400
Wayne?

139
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,100
Take Amy outside for a second.

140
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,600
come on,sweat

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,700
okay, even though the bullet went through,

142
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm still going to have to clean out this wound.

143
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,800
It's gonna hurt.

144
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,800
But I promise you

145
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,400
I'll get you to a hospital as soon as I can.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,500
In the meantime,

147
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,900
I'm going to have Wayne look after you.

148
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,400
No. I'll be fine.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,500
You need to get the evidence.

150
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,300
And you'll need help.

151
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,300
Are you sure?

152
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,700
Yeah.

153
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,100
Okay.

154
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,500
Keep pressure on it.

155
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,900
Sweetheart, you can see your mom now.

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,700
Give me the car keys.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,600
Let's go.

158
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
I haven't been able to pick up Bauer's trail yet.

159
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,300
So he got away.

160
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,600
And there's nothing to stop him and Wayne Palmer

161
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,300
from going to the media with everything they know.

162
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Jack knows there's no point in going public until he has proof.

163
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
He won't make any accusations

164
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,400
until he has that evidence in his hand.

165
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
This evidence, this...

166
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,100
this recording that Evelyn made of our conversation.

167
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,000
Are you any closer to finding out where she's hidden it?

168
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,300
No, sir, not yet.

169
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,000
But she was wounded,

170
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,300
and I will find her;

171
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
we're monitoring hospitals,

172
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,400
emergency services.

173
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
This is containable,

174
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
I promise you.

175
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,500
Please spare me your promises, Mr. Henderson.

176
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
It's all gone wrong.

177
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,700
None of this should have happened.

178
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,700
All these killings...

179
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
this whole thing was planned to make our country safer.

180
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,600
Stronger.

181
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,000
To protect our interests.

182
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
And it all spiraled out of control

183
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,200
when you decided to kill David Palmer.

184
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Mr. President,what's done is done.

185
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,300
And right now,

186
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,300
we have to focus on stopping Bauer

187
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
before he finds that recording.

188
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,000
No.

189
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,300
You have to focus on it.

190
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Why haven't the analysts finished the hourlies?

191
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,700
They're still getting up to speed on CTU's protocols.

192
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,400
We knew this wasn't going to be a seamless transition.

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,600
Sometimes I wonder if it was even a necessary one.

194
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,100
Karen...

195
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,500
CTU's performance today has been considerably less than stellar.

196
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,200
Dozens of people have been killed.

197
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,300
And they weren't even able to prevent an attack on themselves.

198
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,100
Do you really believe,

199
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
under the circumstances,

200
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,700
that we could have done any better?

201
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,200
Ms. Hayes?

202
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
The President is on line one.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,300
Put him through to Bill Buchanan's office,

204
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,700
I'll be working out of there from now on.

205
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,900
And have medical notify me as soon as bierko has regained consciousness.

206
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,200
Miles.

207
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Yes, Mr. President?

208
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,800
Karen.

209
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,100
Do you know where Jack Bauer is?

210
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,500
Not at the moment, sir.

211
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,800
He was due back here 30 minutes ago to lead the bierko interrogation.

212
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,800
He's gone off grid.

213
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm not surprised.

214
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,400
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediate apprehension

215
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,800
and arrest of Jack Bauer.

216
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
I want you to run point on this,

217
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,800
and I want you to make this CTU's top priority.

218
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,200
Yes, sir.

219
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
For purposes of the warrant,

220
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,700
I'll need to know what Bauer's being charged with.

221
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,100
His role in the assassination of President David Palmer.

222
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,800
But I understood that

223
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,500
he'd been exonerated of that charge, sir.

224
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,800
You, yourself,reinstated his credentials.

225
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,000
I know, but I didn't have all the facts then.

226
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,500
Some new evidence has come to light.

227
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,800
New evidence?

228
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,900
Yes.

229
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm looking at it right now,

230
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,900
and I will forward it to you at the appropriate time.

231
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,900
Yes, sir.

232
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,300
Karen.

233
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,700
Obviously, this is a very sensitive matter,

234
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,300
and for now I would like you to treat the origin of this warrant as confidential.

235
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,400
Understood, sir.

236
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,150
Put out an alert on Jack Bauer to all

237
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,200
federal law enforcement agencies and NSA.

238
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,500
I'll also get military the warrant

239
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,400
they have more men on the street than anyone.

240
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,700
I don't like this.

241
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
Pulling our resources off finding Christopher Henderson

242
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
to go after Jack Bauer without knowing the evidence?

243
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,200
It's a direct order from the President.

244
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, if we really want to find Bauer,

245
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,400
we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help.

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Starting with Audrey Raines.

247
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,900
What's this?

248
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,900
Chloe, open it up

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and make it look like this is what we're talking about.

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,700
Okay...

251
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,500
can you get me a secure channel,

252
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,500
so the calls on my cell phone can't be monitored?

253
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,500
Using a vpn pathway, sure.

254
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,200
Take somebody about an hour to crack.

255
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,200
Why, what's going on?

256
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I just spoke with Jack.

257
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,700
Gardner isn't the one who's behind this.

258
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,700
It's President Logan.

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,600
What?

260
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Jack is on his way getting proof.

261
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm leaving now to go help him.

262
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,900
Take a CTU walkie.

263
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,300
Audrey.

264
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,900
It's a warrant for Jack's arrest.

265
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,100
It's starting.

266
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,400
What do we do?

267
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Heading out?

268
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Yes, I'm going to try to grab a couple hours of sleep.

269
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I came to talk to both of you about the warrant.

270
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,500
Well, let's start with why the hell it was issued.

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,300
There's new evidence implicating Jack in David Palmer's assassination.

272
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,500
That's ridiculous.

273
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,100
I was there when the assassin confessed.

274
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,300
All you have to do is check the log.

275
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
I know about the logs, Chloe.

276
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,900
My orders are to bring Jack in.

277
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,000
New evidence?

278
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Have you seen it?

279
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,100
It's forthcoming.

280
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Who ordered this, Karen?

281
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.

282
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,600
When was the last time you spoke with Jack?

283
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,600
About an hour ago.

284
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,100
We haven't had contact since.

285
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,900
I hope I don't have to remind either one of you

286
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,200
that you have a legal obligation to notify me if Jack contacts you.

287
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,900
Look, I know this may seem odd to the both of you

288
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
frankly, it does to me

289
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,500
but let's remember

290
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,500
it's in everyone's best interest to bring Jack in peacefully.

291
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,100
Have a good night.

292
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,100
Thank you.

293
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,000
Harris.

294
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,800
Valerie?

295
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,200
Audrey's on her way.

296
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
What's your status?

297
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,900
We're placing the transponder on Audrey's car right now.

298
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,400
Good.

299
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
There won't be many cars on the road,

300
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,100
so use the tracker and stay out of sight.

301
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,900
Will do.

302
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,200
We don't want anything to stop Audrey from leading us to Bauer.

303
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,170
That's the house.

304
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,490
Okay.

305
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,050
What's the bank manager's name?

306
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,480
Carl Mossman.

307
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,660
You got your gun?

308
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,800
Yeah,but we don't need them for this,do we?

309
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,670
He's not going to let into his bank in the middle of the night

310
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,060
unless he thinks he has to.

311
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,380
Jack,why don't we just try telling him the truth?

312
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,690
Would you believe it?

313
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
The only way we're going to have his full compliance is if he's scared.

314
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,900
If you're uncomfortable with that,you should stay here.

315
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,130
They've got a magnetic alarm.

316
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,030
We're in.

317
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,870
...That will take place within the hour.

318
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,710
At that time,

319
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,280
President Logan is scheduled to make a statement to the american people

320
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,090
about the successful resolution of today's terrorist threat.

321
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,090
Did you hear something?

322
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,920
Like what?

323
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,970
I don't know.

324
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,950
Carl?

325
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,470
Hang on.

326
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,630
Carl?

327
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,560
I'll be right back.

328
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,140
Don't you move.

329
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,850
Rose,call the police...!

330
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
cover him.

331
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,950
Put the phone down.

332
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,880
Put the phone down now!

333
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,360
Bring him in here!

334
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,610
Just stay calm,and everything will be fine.

335
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,600
Let's go

336
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,850
Oh my god. Carl...

337
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,710
Take a seat on the bed.

338
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,390
Okay,look,our money and jewelry's in floor safe in the closet.

339
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,720
We're not interested in that.

340
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,090
You're gonna get us into your bank.

341
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,040
I can't do that.

342
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,250
It's not that I won't. I can't.

343
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,240
The alarm system and the vault only allow entry during business hours.

344
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,510
Don't lie to me.

345
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,140
Every bank has procedures to allow access during an emergency.

346
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,040
Hey! No,no!

347
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll take you to the bank.

348
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,350
Slowly get up,get dressed.

349
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,950
Go on. It's all right,it's all right,it's all right.

350
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,590
I want four of your neckties.

351
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,200
Tie her up to the chair.

352
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,830
Ankles and wrists. Make sure she doesn't move.

353
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,390
Come on.

354
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,730
Yes,hi. This is Audrey Raines.

355
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,210
I need to speak with secretary Heller,please.

356
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,900
Mr. secretary,there's a call coming in for you on an over-air encrypted channel.

357
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,410
It's your daughter.

358
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,190
Audrey,is everything okay?

359
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,090
Hi. Uh,yes,I'm okay.

360
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,580
Dad,I need your help.

361
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,020
Is this a secure line?

362
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,420
Very secure.

363
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,320
Is this about the arrest order for Jack?

364
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,270
I was just informed.

365
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,980
Dad,I can't go into details right now,

366
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,220
but Jack is innocent.He's being set up.

367
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,190
Set up by whom?

368
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,320
What the hell is going on,Audrey?

369
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,950
You call me this morning,to tell me that Jack's alive.

370
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,880
Now I get word he's a suspect again in the Palmer assassination.

371
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,390
Dad,I can't talk to you about it right now.

372
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,820
I need to see you in person.

373
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,890
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles?

374
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,200
Dad,I would never ask you to do this if it wasn't extremely important.

375
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,090
All right,yes.

376
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,940
Thank you.

377
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,360
The closest airport is van nuys.

378
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,490
We're about an hour out.

379
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,390
I'll call you on final approach.

380
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,320
Okay. Thank you.I'll see you there.

381
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,210
I'll see you.

382
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,130
Bye.

383
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,360
Doug!

384
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,840
Yes,sir.

385
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,390
We have to make a stop in L.A.

386
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,900
And keep it off the manifest.

387
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,780
Yes,sir.

388
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,130
Pull over.

389
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,760
She stopped.

390
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,930
Corner of alderton and davis.

391
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,410
It's a gas station.

392
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,370
O'brian.

393
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,600
Chloe,it's me.

394
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,900
Hold on.

395
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,540
Okay,switched over to my own vpn.

396
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,670
Now they can't monitor either end of the conversation.

397
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,620
Do you have the walkie?

398
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,160
Yeah. Hang on.

399
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,020
All right,what do I do with it?

400
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,420
Tune to proprietary channel 17,

401
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,040
turn the sensitivity up all the way.

402
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,820
See if you pick up a pilot signal.

403
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,400
Okay,hold on.

404
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,990
Wow. Do you hear that?

405
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,490
That's what I figured they put a tracker on you.

406
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,340
I found it. All right,Chloe,I got it. Thank you.

407
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,550
Audrey,you need to disable your phone by taking the battery out as soon as you can.

408
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,120
All right,I have to wait for a call from Jack and then I will.


410
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,050
Yes.

411
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,480
Sir,it's almost time.

412
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,050
Yes.

413
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,100
The press conference.

414
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,650
That's right.

415
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,370
Mr. President,

416
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
if I could have a moment...

417
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,510
uh,I should be done with my statement shortly,hal.

418
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,080
This is potentially time sensitive,sir.

419
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,070
I just got an alert that a warrant has been issued for Jack Bauer.

420
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,570
Thank you,Aaron.

421
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,710
Yes,sir.

422
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,160
What about the warrant?

423
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,700
Well,it's an executive branch warrant.

424
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,310
I didn't issue it,so it must have come from you.

425
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,300
That's right,it came from me.

426
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,540
Well,as you've put me in charge of overseeing

427
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,760
CTU and the homeland security transfer,

428
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,120
don't you think you should have discussed it with me first?

429
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,890
I appreciate everything you've done today,hal,

430
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,820
but the last time I checked,

431
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,330
i was still commander in chief.

432
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,690
Of course,Mr. President,but Jack Bauer?

433
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,360
It doesn't make any sense.

434
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,690
We should be treating that man like a hero.

435
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,260
I've gone over the logs.

436
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,440
Walt cummings has confessed that he

437
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,600
arranged Palmer's assassination,framing Bauer.

438
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,630
Well,clearly,cummings was protecting Bauer.

439
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,250
Why?

440
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,160
I don't know why.

441
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,600
But the fact remains I have received confirmation from intelligence sources

442
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,020
that Jack Bauer was,without question,the shooter.

443
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,650
-Which sources? -That's enough!

444
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,150
I'm not going to stand here and have my orders challenged.

445
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,560
You have concerns,hal.

446
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,170
We'll sort this all out once Bauer's in custody.

447
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,240
Does that suit you?

448
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,330
Yes,sir.

449
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,860
Good.

450
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,650
Mom?

451
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,810
Amy?

452
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,710
I'm coming.

453
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,150
Sweetheart,it's okay.

454
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,260
Mom! Mom!

455
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,770
911. What's your emergency?

456
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,150
My mom she passed out.

457
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,340
I can't wake her up.

458
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,320
Calm down. Tell me your name.

459
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,910
Amy. My mom's name is Evelyn.

460
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,480
What's your mom's last name?

461
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Martin.

462
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,520
Her name's Evelyn Martin.

463
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,610
All right,honey,now tell me where you are.

464
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,610
Yeah.

465
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:13,570
Sir,a call is coming in to the 911 operator from a motel 6 on porter valley drive

466
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,810
requesting medical assistance for an Evelyn Martin.

467
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,950
Be there shortly.

468
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,440
My fellow americans,it is with great relief

469
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:39,410
that I announce that the terrorist threat our nation faced today is over.

470
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,360
More than an hour ago,federal counter-terrorist agents,under my direction,

471
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,230
thwarted the latest attack on innocent civilians,

472
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,520
the nature of which was kept secret due to national security.

473
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,460
This was done with the public's best interest in mind.

474
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,400
He really did it.

475
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,150
Ma'am?

476
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,640
Charles.

477
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,410
He stopped the terrorists,

478
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,370
the treaty was signed.

479
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,500
He said he would ride out this crisis,

480
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,980
and everything would be okay.

481
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,600
And it is.

482
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,190
I should have trusted him.

483
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,780
Yes,ma'am.

484
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,940
What's wrong,Aaron?

485
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,280
I'm just a little battle worn.

486
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,520
They attempted to derail the historic accord...

487
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,930
Jack,why are we stopping here?

488
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,690
There's too many military checkpoints in the area.

489
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,210
They'll stop our car.

490
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,730
We have to go the rest of the way on foot.

491
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,310
How far is the bank from here?

492
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,020
About a quarter of a mile that way.

493
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,060
be right back.

494
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,640
Aaron,it's Jack.

495
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,830
Jack,are you aware President Logan's issued a warrant for your arrest

496
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,420
for your role in David Palmer's assassination?

497
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,530
No,but that makes sense.

498
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,350
The vice President's not the one who's behind this,is he?

499
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,750
No,it's Logan.

500
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,380
They're going to have every agency and the military looking for you.

501
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,490
And Logan is the only one who can call them off.

502
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,890
As soon as we have the evidence in hand,

503
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,950
we're gonna pass it off to secretary of defense Heller.

504
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,710
After that,it's not gonna matter.

505
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,830
Is there anything i can do for you,Jack?

506
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,810
Keep your eyes open and watch your back.

507
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,680
Will do.

508
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,570
Get out of the car.

509
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,550
Come on.

510
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,730
Let's go.

511
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,820
Move,move.

512
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,790
Take cover,go!

513
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,540
Not a word.

514
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,440
Ms. Hayes,valerie Harris is on line two for you.

515
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,670
She says it's urgent.

516
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,060
Valerie,what's happening?

517
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,870
We lost Audrey Raines.

518
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,670
What?

519
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,240
She found the tracker and transferred it to a dwp truck at a gas station.

520
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,040
Damn it. How did she find it?She's got no field experience.

521
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,580
I don't know.

522
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:35,040
The only reason we discovered it is the dwp guy stopped to check a faulty power line.

523
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,550
All right,hold your position and wait for my instructions.

524
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,380
Will do.

525
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,790
Papazian.

526
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,530
Audrey Raines ditched her transponder.

527
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,470
I need you to redirect satellite surveillance and track her.

528
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,690
I can redirect caltrans and maybe one sat-link,

529
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,420
but the rest are dedicated to finding Bauer.

530
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,710
Following Audrey should lead us right to Bauer.

531
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,840
Just get it done and tell me when you've got something.

532
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,890
I'm on it.

533
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,810
Against the wall.

534
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,940
Watch him.

535
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,370
Just do what he says,carl.

536
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,430
Do what he says and you'll be home before you know it.

537
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,810
Right.

538
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,380
What's the emergency procedure to enter the bank?

539
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,450
I have 30 seconds to put my key in the alarm panel,

540
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,460
then I enter my code.

541
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,170
You enter the wrong code and alert the police,

542
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,320
all I have to do is make one call,your wife is dead.

543
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,290
You understand me?

544
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,150
Yes.

545
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,640
Let's go.

546
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,080
Where's the vault?

547
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,460
Take us around the back,stay away from the windows.

548
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,130
How do I open it?

549
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,970
There's a 12-digit code,but it's a timed unlock procedure,

550
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,030
which allows enough time for the police to arrive in the event

551
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,690
that someone should trigger the silent alarm.

552
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,730
Write the code down for me.

553
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,120
Take him over to one of the desks,keep an eye on him.

554
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,700
I know you.

555
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,080
No,you don't.

556
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,680
Yes,I do.You're David Palmer's brother.

557
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,170
I saw you on tv this morning.

558
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,690
You were there when he was shot.

559
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,820
Now,what the hell are you doing in my bank?

560
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,650
And who is he?

561
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,020
Listen,I know it's absurd to ask you to trust me under these circumstances,

562
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,870
but believe me,you don't want to know.

563
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,970
Oh,come on.

564
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,690
You threaten me with a gun,

565
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,280
you kidnap me,you're robbing my bank.

566
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,300
Now,I deserve to know what the hell is going on here.

567
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,910
Fine.

568
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,910
Jack and I believe there's evidence inside of one of your safety deposit boxes

569
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,370
that's gonna prove who was behind the assassination of my brother,okay?

570
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,990
Wayne.

571
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,010
What's going on?

572
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,020
What do you want me to say,Jack?

573
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,750
He recognized me.

574
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,130
It's all right.

575
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,720
Mr. Mossman,

576
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,830
how long is the delay before the vault opens?

577
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,520
Five minutes.Is that true what he said?

578
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,140
Is that why you two are here?

579
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,760
Yes.

580
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,880
Why didn't you just wait till morning,get a subpoena?

581
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,220
The people that are behind this will never let it go that far.

582
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,070
They've already tried to kill me twice tonight,carl.

583
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,350
And they're gonna try again the very first chance they get.

584
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,310
mom.

585
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,530
Miss Martin,you're in shock.

586
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,490
But you're going to be okay.

587
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,040
You know my name?

588
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,670
Where's Bauer?

589
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,920
You did?Well, that's good.I'm glad.

590
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,550
I'll get back to you.

591
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,570
I thought you went to bed.

592
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,910
No.

593
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,300
I, watched you with the press.

594
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,120
Well,that was Morry,and he thought it went pretty well.

595
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,680
Good.

596
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,630
But that doesn't begin to describe it.

597
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,090
Charles, you have had to deal with more crisis today

598
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,870
than any President in an entire term.

599
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,860
You...were magnificent.

600
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,710
Magnificent.Well, I like the sound of that.

601
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,060
Especially coming from you.

602
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,390
I'm so proud of you.

603
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,130
I hope I haven't embarrassed you too much as your first lady.

604
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,080
Stop. No.Don't be ridiculous.

605
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,370
I mean,you walked up to the edge a couple times,but nobody noticed.

606
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,400
I'll try to find a compliment in there somewhere.

607
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,630
I'm sorry, Marty.I didn't...

608
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,100
I was so selfish today.

609
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,340
-No. -You had so much on your plate,you didn't need me piling more on.

610
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:20,380
-No, I... -Please don't say anything.Just accept my apology.

611
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,800
I do.I do, I accept your apology.

612
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,780
I have to take this privately.

613
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,360
Who is it?

614
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,230
Now, what difference does it make?Please, Marty.

615
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,820
I thought the crisis was over.I thought you and I...

616
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,010
all right.

617
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,030
Yes.

618
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,500
We know where Bauer is location.Evelyn gave him up.

619
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,790
Well, then take care of it.

620
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,610
My men are heading there now.

621
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,400
-Good.Let me know when it's done. -I will.

622
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,620
I'm sorry, honey.I guess I haven't gotten used to the idea that...

623
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,230
that the crisis is over.

624
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,140
When what's done?

625
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,240
What?

626
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,870
You just said,"let me know when it's done."

627
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,890
that was jamey.

628
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,750
I asked her to write me a radio speech for tomorrow morning.

629
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,110
-We found Audrey Raines. -Where?

630
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,540
She's heading north toward Mulholland.

631
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,600
Connect me with Harris.

632
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,030
Harris.

633
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,550
Valerie,we have a fix on Raines.

634
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,580
She's heading toward the sepulveda pass,coming up on Mulholland.

635
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,280
Let's go.

636
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,620
Chloe?Do you have a minute?

637
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,250
No.

638
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,110
What is it?

639
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,480
I was assigned to log all satellite and ground video activity,

640
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,490
but part of the vector is locked out.

641
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,660
Locked out?What do you mean?

642
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,400
I mean, someone's taken control of one of the satellites using a class one priority override.

643
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,040
Do you know anything about it?

644
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,020
No.I'll look into it.

645
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,130
Thanks.

646
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,390
Crap.

647
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,000
All points are covered, sir.The perimeter is secure.

648
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,340
Do you have a visual?

649
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,940
I did, briefly.

650
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,450
All right, listen.You tell your men the instant,

651
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,800
and I mean the instant that Bauer steps outside that bank building you take him down.

652
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,730
Then, kill the others and secure the recording.

653
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,360
Which one is it?

654
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,970
Twenty-three.

655
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,790
Mr. Palmer,I admired your brother a great deal.He was a great man.

656
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,390
Thank you.

657
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,120
It had to be done, sir.

658
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,040
I decide what needs to be done, Mr. Henderson.

659
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,390
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.

660
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,250
Palmer was nosing around.

661
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,160
He'd have found out about your involvement.For god's sake, sir,he called your wife.

662
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,350
I can handle my wife.

663
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,380
Right now, my concern is keeping this operation from collapsing like a house of cards.

664
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,980
That's President Logan's voice.

665
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,920
Every thread ends with cummings.

666
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,720
He thinks he's running this, and you need to keep playing it that way.

667
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,390
I know my part,Mr. Henderson.

668
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,310
You just do as you're told.

669
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,490
Oh, my god.

670
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,580
We got what we need.

671
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,240
Mr. Mossman,I'm sorry we put you and your wife through this.

672
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,280
It'll be safer for you to stay here now.Could you please let us out?

673
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,650
Like to help if I can.I've come this far.

674
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,340
We're gonna need to borrow your car a little longer.

675
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,130
Sure, it's insured.

676
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,320
Wait. There's someone inside.Mr. Mossman, get back in the vault now.

677
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,300
Is there any other way out of here besides the front door?

678
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,970
No, front door only security reasons.

679
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,950
Damn it.

680
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,150
Both of you stay here.I'll be right back.

681
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,760
Henderson's men are taking up positions.

682
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,770
There's no other way out we're gonna have to turn ourselves in.

683
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,620
They didn't come here to arrest us; they came here to kill us.

684
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,560
What are they waiting for?

685
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,280
All the windows are bulletproof.They're waiting for us to leave the building.

686
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,250
So what are you gonna do?

687
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,410
How do you trip the silent alarm?

688
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,660
I have a key, but you trip that alarm, lapd will be here within a few minutes.

689
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,640
That's exactly what I want.

690
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,750
Henderson's men outnumber us.We leave this building now,we lose.

691
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,850
Jack, if you call the cops,they're gonna get the recording when we're taken into custody.

692
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,530
We won't be taken into custody.

693
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,050
As soon as Henderson finds out the lapd have arrived,

694
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,260
he's gonna have his men engage them.

695
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,240
He doesn't want the police to have the recording any more than he wants us to have it.

696
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,740
So they start shooting at each other.How does that help us?

697
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,770
We have to try and use that as a diversion.It's our only way out.

698
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,600
Trigger the alarm.

699
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,380
Let's get ready.

700
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,370
Valerie.The feed should be coming through to your laptop now.

701
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,120
I've got her.

702
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,800
She's heading west on chandler.

703
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,620
How close are you to Audrey's car?

704
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,150
About two miles.

705
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,780
Close the gap to one mile.

706
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,300
We will do.

707
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,390
Something's wrong.

708
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,710
The feed's breaking up.

709
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,680
We're experiencing the same difficulty with our signal hold on.

710
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,960
What's going on?

711
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,050
I don't know.

712
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,760
The satellite's positioned correctly.

713
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,710
I'm tracing the corruption.

714
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,080
It's the server.

715
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,480
-What is it? -O'brian's gone.

716
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,750
What were you doing?

717
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,050
What?

718
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,090
What were you doing?

719
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,030
Are you kidding?

720
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,810
If you really want the details,I'll write you a report.

721
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,150
Let's go, now.

722
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,740
Mr. Mossman, like I said before,

723
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,990
it might be safer for you to stay here in the bank.

724
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,680
No, these guys find me,they assume I know about the recording,

725
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,210
they'd probably kill me, right?

726
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,870
I'll take my chances with you.

727
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,700
I want you to stay as close to Mr. Palmer as you can.

728
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,310
I'll provide cover fire.Once we leave the bank,you break left.

729
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,400
Yes, sir.

730
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,730
Cooper, what's your status?

731
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,320
No change,they still haven't come out.

732
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,380
Must have seen you, damn it.Tell your men to move in immediately.

733
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,250
The cops are here.

734
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,660
We can't let them have Bauer take 'em down.

735
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,760
Yes, sir.

736
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,750
This is lapd!Drop your weapons!

737
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,170
let's go.

738
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,290
need to go to the police car now move!

739
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,960
He's been hit!

740
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,340
How is he doing?

741
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,810
He's dead.

742
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,320
Damn it.

743
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,960
Jack, where are you?

744
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,280
I'm on my way to you.Did your father agree to meet?

745
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,120
Yes, he's landing at van nuys airport in about 15 minutes.I'm there now.

746
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,910
Good, we got the evidence.

747
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,710
Have you listened to it?

748
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,780
Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan.

749
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,150
You understand what this means.

750
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,830
We're talking about taking down the President of the united states.
