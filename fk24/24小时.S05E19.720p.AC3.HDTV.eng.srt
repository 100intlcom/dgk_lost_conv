1
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,570
As soon as I get the recording, we're going to have to involve your father.

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,320
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark.

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,340
Tell me what this is all about.

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,170
I will. I just need a minute.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,720
I decide what needs to be done,Mr.Henderson.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,340
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,750
President Logan?

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,410
And a man named Christopher Henderson.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,150
I know what you did. I know what you're doing.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,810
And I'm going to put an end to it.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,590
You asked to see me,Mr. President?

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,060
Hal,I'm asking secretary Heller to tender his resignation

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,290
-and I wanted you here as a witness.  -What?!

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,770
He came here to accuse me of being complicit in today's terrorist attacks.

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,430
-Miles set me up.  -Please come with us,Ms. O'brian.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,910
We traced your call to a public phone at van nuys airport.

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,360
If Audrey Raines is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble.

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,460
You're supposed to be in custody.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,840
You helped Audrey Raines break surveillance.

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,630
You're sick and you need help and if you try to stop me,

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,680
I will recommend you for psychiatric evaluation.

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,490
Get in here.

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,200
-I haven't been able to contact Jack or Audrey.  -I haven't talked to them either.

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,280
Whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us.I promise you.

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,780
Not here.Outside the south stable.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,650
-Is Bauer dead?  -Not yet,Mr. President.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,330
-He has the recording.  -Yes,sir.

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,520
That evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death.

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,680
Son of a bitch.

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,930
What the hell's going on?!

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
They've come for the recording.

32
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,990
Audrey!

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,750
I have her,Jack!

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,240
What have you done to her?

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,250
The left brachial artery.

36
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,250
She has about three minutes before she bleeds to death.Now throw me that recording.

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,670
Jack,don't do it.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,080
She's running out of time.

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,060
-Don't give it up.  -Here it is.

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,680
Stay with me.

41
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,600
Stay with me.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,710
The follwing takes place between 1Am and 2Am.

43
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,100
I need to loosen the tourniquet.

44
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,270
Oh! Ooh!

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,430
Good. The bleeding's stopped, which means he didn't sever the brachial artery.

46
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,850
I need to get you to a doctor.

47
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,210
Jack,I can wait.Do what you have to do.

48
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,640
-Are you sure?  -Yes.

49
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,880
Keep your arm elevated.

50
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,910
Chloe O'brian is not available.

51
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,820
Chloe's not picking up her phone.

52
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,230
Is there someone else who can help you track Henderson?

53
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,030
No one who has the same access to the CTU satellite network.

54
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,890
Jack,I'm so sorry.This is my fault.

55
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,550
Audrey,stop it.

56
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,030
I'll be right back.

57
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,160
This is Jack Bauer.

58
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,310
Jack?

59
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,400
Why are you answering wexler's phone?

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,140
Wexler's dead.Henderson and a commando unit attacked us 15 minutes ago.

61
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,630
They killed all your men and took the recording back.

62
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,360
Is Audrey all right?

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,870
She's fine.

64
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,390
Did you cut your deal with Logan?

65
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,780
Logan accepted my terMs.

66
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,000
Then he took a call, and suddenly changed his mind.

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,590
That call must have come from Henderson.

68
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,510
Jack,we have to get the recording back.

69
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,240
If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,670
With all due respect,Mr. Secretary,

71
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,170
I asked you for your help, and you betrayed me.

72
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,940
Jack,I did what I thought was best for this country.

73
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,270
I made a mistake.Please forgive me.

74
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,620
I need to go,sir.

75
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,590
Come!

76
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,920
-hello?  -Bill,it's Jack.

77
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
Jack,we've been waiting to hear from you.

78
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,390
Did you get the recording to secretary Heller?

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,580
I don't have time to explain. Henderson's got the recording.

80
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,750
I need Chloe to help me find him, but I can't reach her.

81
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,430
Chloe's here with me,Jack.

82
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,560
She was arrestedby homeland security for helping you,but she managed to get away.

83
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,820
Put her on speaker.

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,270
Jack,where are you?

85
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,070
I'm at van nuys airfield.Chloe,listen to me.

86
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,970
Henderson left here ten minutes ago with a recording that implicates president Logan.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,760
I need you to access CTU's satellite data streams so that we can find him.

88
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,810
If I log onto their system,they're gonna find me eventually,no matter what I do.

89
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,380
I don't need you to track him for long. Do you think you can do it?

90
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,580
I guess I can try to slip in through the subnets.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,870
Get back to me when you're in.

92
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,550
I'll set up a vpn pathway, so that they can't trace our call,

93
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,500
but it will only work with the phone you're using.

94
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,810
Okay.

95
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,010
I got a hold of Chloe. We need to go.

96
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,260
-Okay. Can you get up?  -Yeah.

97
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,800
Slowly.

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,620
come on.

99
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,100
If we're going to do extensive satellite tracking,I need more than my laptop.

100
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,380
I'm gonna have to network onto your computer,

101
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,430
even though it's kind of pathetic,and I need you to get that screen to work for me.

102
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,270
All right.

103
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,570
I hope you don't mind me bossing you around,

104
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,360
but technically,I don't work for you anymore.

105
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,360
-That's all right,Chloe.  -Good.

106
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,630
Bauer.

107
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,250
Jack,I'm pulling up satellite footage of the airfield from 15 minutes ago.

108
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,170
Look for an explosion in the northwest corner.

109
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,190
Okay,I see it.

110
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,560
About five minutes after that,a vehicle leaves the airfield.That'll be Henderson.

111
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,350
He went south on the service drive, and east on menders,

112
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,800
then I lose him on the grid.

113
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,690
Use another satellite,traffic cams, whatever you have to,just find him.

114
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,240
It's gonna take us a few minutes. We're just setting up,but we're on it.

115
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,080
Copy that.Get back to me as soon as you got him on a live feed.

116
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,710
what makes you think that Henderson hasn't already destroyed the recording?

117
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,190
He would have done it immediately, in front of me.

118
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,420
Given me less of a reason to come after him.

119
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,900
Why would he keep it?

120
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,770
It's his insurance.

121
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,640
Yes.

122
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,720
Is Bauer dead?

123
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,990
No.

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,330
What happened?

125
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,420
All that matters is that I have the recording.

126
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,360
Have you destroyed it?

127
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,780
No,sir,I have not.

128
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,410
Why,what's the problem?

129
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,190
Actually,I'm making sure they're won't be any probleMs.

130
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,540
I don't understand.

131
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,570
I may need protection. That recording gives it to me.

132
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,920
-Protection?  -Yes,sir.

133
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,540
Do you mean from me?That's absurd.

134
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,160
With all due respect,Mr. President,

135
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,410
it isn't absurd, as evidenced by walt cummings suicide.

136
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,560
That was different.

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,470
You told me yourself that was necessary.

138
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,570
And I'm assuming that one day,others will tell you the very same thing about me.

139
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,220
Chris,

140
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,720
you and I have been in this from the beginning.

141
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Destroying that recording protects both of us.

142
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,680
I'm sorry,Mr. President.

143
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,370
I give you my word it will be kept in a very place safe,

144
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,550
and will only be made public should I meet with some...

145
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,050
accident.

146
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,090
Chris,this is completely unnecessary.

147
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,970
I'm sure it is,sir.Then again,

148
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,170
I am a very cautious man.

149
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,020
Chloe,have you got Henderson yet?

150
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,410
Yes,his car is three quarters of a mile in front of you.

151
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,460
He had a head start.He should be farther along than that.

152
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,070
I don't know what to tell you. It's definitely the car he left the airport in.

153
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,650
How long until I've got a visual?

154
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,930
The road curves up ahead,Jack.

155
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,780
You should be able to see him once it straightens out.

156
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,450
Hold on.

157
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,620
got him.

158
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,150
get down.

159
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,840
Damn!

160
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,420
It's over,Christopher.

161
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,410
Turn around!

162
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,320
Put the gun down and keep your hands where I can them.

163
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,780
Do it or I will kill you!

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,700
You kill me,Jack,secretary Heller dies,too.

165
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,930
What are you talking about?

166
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,500
There's always a contingency plan,Jack. You know that.

167
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,190
My men have been tracking Heller from a chopper ever since he left Logan's retreat.

168
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,830
Now,if I can't contact them every 15 minutes on the dot,

169
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,710
they have orders to kill secretary Heller.

170
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,020
Which means,you got about three minutes to save his life.

171
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,660
Jack?

172
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,790
Audrey,please get back in the car.

173
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,460
Is he lying about my father?

174
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,040
Slowly walk towards me.

175
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,060
Put your hands behind your head.

176
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,920
Get on your knees.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,150
Cuff yourself.

178
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,970
Yeah,Jack.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,720
Chloe,patch me through to secretary Heller's cell phone.

180
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,690
See if you can get a satellite to lock on his signal.

181
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,040
I need you to download a visual of his vehicle on my pda.

182
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,310
He was leaving Logan's retreat just before 1:00.

183
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,880
On it. Open up the parallel channel on the nsa's landsats,

184
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,530
can radial slices in three mile increments,emanating from the retreat... sir.

185
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,280
Okay,Jack,I'm pulling up the dod database.

186
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,710
Here it is,I'm patching you through.

187
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,470
Copy that.

188
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,770
Heller.

189
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,480
Mr. Secretary,it's Jack. I need you to confirm for me

190
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,100
if a helicopter's been tracking your vehicle?

191
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,450
What's going on,Jack?

192
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,600
Sir,time is critical. Is there a helicopter above you or not?

193
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,720
Yeah,there's a chopper above me. Who are they?

194
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,740
Henderson's men.He claims he's given them orders to kill you if I don't let him go.

195
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,240
Is he bluffing?

196
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,010
He doesn't do that,sir.

197
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,980
Jack,I've got Heller's car. I'm patching it through to your pda.

198
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,680
Copy that.

199
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,100
Jack...

200
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,220
they have a laser sight trained on me.

201
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,590
Get up.

202
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,760
You give me the recording, I let you go: That's the deal.

203
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,920
No.

204
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,380
Come on,Jack,you're wasting time.

205
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,710
We both know you're not going to let Heller die.

206
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,730
I can hear him,Jack; don't let him do this.

207
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,060
I'm going to walkout of here,Jack,

208
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,800
and you're not gonna stop me,so uncuff me.

209
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,960
Jack,don't let him go.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
I don't have a choice,sir.

211
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,810
Yes,you do.

212
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,730
If I had listened to you in the first place, none of this would be happening.

213
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,050
This is my responsibility,

214
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,250
I will not allow Logan and Henderson to use me as a pawn.

215
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,310
Sir?

216
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,850
Do not let them get away with this.

217
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,210
Make sure that the recording gets to the right people.

218
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,070
Tell Audrey I love her.

219
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,630
Mr. Secretary,what are you doing?!

220
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,640
Chloe,are you still on the line?!

221
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,590
Can you confirm that Heller just drove his car into the lake?

222
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,290
Yes.

223
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,940
Damn you!

224
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,150
Oh,my god,no.

225
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,450
How could you do this?

226
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,950
This isn't about what you think is best for the country.

227
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,950
This is about your greed for power.

228
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,790
Today,you have been responsible

229
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,630
for killing an ex-president,David Palmer,

230
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,100
and the secretary of defense, two real patriots.

231
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,480
Damn you!

232
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,140
What happened to you?

233
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,240
Give me the recording.

234
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,180
I don't have it.

235
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,180
Where is it?!

236
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,390
I'm not going to tell you,Jack.

237
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,920
And you know that--no matter what you do to me.

238
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,350
Do it.

239
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,360
Kill him,Jack. Do it!

240
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,480
Yeah.

241
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,260
-Graham?  -Yes.

242
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,030
You need to cancel the action against Henderson immediately.

243
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,830
Why?

244
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,170
He has the recording, but he's made arrangements

245
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,870
to have it released if anything happens to him.

246
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,100
You should have exercised more control over him.

247
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,580
There's a limit to how much I can do.

248
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,610
-Apparently.  -Don't.

249
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,590
Don't you use that tone with me. We've both made mistakes today.

250
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,150
You're right, Mr. President,my apologies,

251
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,580
but the fact is, I think we have a bigger problem than Henderson.

252
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,900
What? What are you talking about?

253
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,010
At least he can be trusted to act rationally,in his own interest.

254
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,790
Unfortunately, the same is not true of your wife.

255
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,260
My wife.

256
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,440
Apparently,there's a secret service agent named aaron Pierce

257
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,190
who knows a little more than he should. He intends to share that with Martha.

258
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,910
I'm well aware of that,and I've taken steps to deal with agent Pierce.

259
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,100
But the real problem is mrs. Logan.

260
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
She continues to talk,to ask questions, talk about her suspicions.

261
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,100
People don't take her seriously. They think she's unstable.

262
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,470
There are too many loose ends lying around.

263
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,470
We cannot afford to have her pull on one and unravel everything.

264
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,850
You think I don't realize that?

265
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,780
I think

266
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,890
you're in a very difficult position and that you have been hoping

267
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,560
the situation with Martha would resolve itself, but it hasn't.You must silence her.

268
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,950
I know.

269
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,070
But I'll handle this myself.

270
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,840
Mrs. Logan,

271
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,780
agent Pierce was transferred.

272
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,440
That's what you keep saying,

273
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,910
but it doesn't make any sense, not at 1:00 in the morning.

274
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,010
We work around the clock, ma'am.

275
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,700
It's quite common for agents to get pulled off details at odd hours.

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,230
Right when they're supposed to have a meeting with the first lady of the united states?

277
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,030
-I don't know anything about a meeting.  -Well, I do!

278
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,060
I found aaron's phone laying on the ground, right where we were supposed to meet.

279
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,150
Now, I want you to find agent Pierce, and I want you to get him back here, right now!

280
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,260
There's a glitch in the scheduling software, I can not pull that record up right now.

281
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,600
And are these glitches quite common, as well?

282
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,110
Actually, no, but...mrs. Logan.

283
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm agent adaMs. I think I can explain everything.

284
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,560
Well?

285
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,010
This is a sensitive issue, ma'am. President Logan would like you to come with me.

286
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,510
What is this "sensitive" information?

287
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,020
Is it about agent Pierce?

288
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,990
I'm sorry--you need to talk to the president about that.

289
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm asking you.

290
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,770
Do you know where aaron Pierce is?

291
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,550
No, ma'am, I don't.

292
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,220
Is this where my husband is?

293
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,390
I want to talk to him.

294
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,620
Charles?

295
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,890
Hello?

296
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,580
Yeah.

297
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,640
Henderson wasn't lying. He doesn't have the recording on him.

298
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Could it be in his car?

299
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,230
No, he wouldn't have left it behind. There must have been some kind of a hand-off.

300
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,060
What do you mean?

301
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,940
Well, that would explain why he wasn't any farther ahead of me.

302
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,790
When I left van nuys airfield.

303
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,170
He must have stopped and given it to someone.

304
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,300
Okay, I'll back trace the route with the satellite,see if I can spot anything.

305
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,700
Jack, we're getting that recording and exposing Logan.

306
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,360
I don't care how far I have to go or what I have to do,do you understand, Jack?

307
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,260
Yes.

308
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,140
Go ahead.

309
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,100
Jack, you were right,I found the hand-off.

310
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,980
Henderson stopped and rendezvoused with another car.

311
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,290
I'm sorry I didn't see it before.

312
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,570
Can you track the other car?

313
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,460
We're tracking it now, Jack. It headed back to van nuys.

314
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,000
Looks like the civilian side of the airfield.

315
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,890
Pulled onto the tarmac.

316
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,190
Whoever was in it got out and got directly onto the plane.

317
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,770
Isn't air traffic still grounded?

318
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,550
Yeah, this is not a commercial flight. I'll find out what I can about it.

319
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,800
Jack, the plane is servicing. It's about to take off.

320
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,470
Has Curtis been relieved of his duty, or is he still attached to CTU?

321
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,330
He's at CTU, taking orders from homeland security, but I think we can trust him, Jack.

322
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,670
Where is he?

323
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,060
According to the deployment grid,he's 25 miles

324
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,330
Bill, I want you to call him.

325
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,120
Get him to this location as soon as possible.

326
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,030
I want him to transfer Henderson and Audrey back to CTU.

327
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,630
Are you sure that's a good idea? Logan's in control at CTU.

328
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,890
Curtis will be able to protect them.

329
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,220
Right now, it's our best chance to secure

330
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,440
Henderson and get Audrey the medical attention she needs.

331
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,900
Calling Curtis now, Jack.

332
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,210
Thanks.

333
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,440
What's happening?

334
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,360
The peppmh hehderson gave the recordhng to

335
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,760
just boarded a plane at van nuys airfield.

336
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,310
Why aren't you going now?

337
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,690
I'll go as soon as Curtis gets here--he's not far.

338
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,900
Jack, I'll be fine until then.

339
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,360
I'm not leaving you here alone.

340
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,000
Jack, if you don't get that recording, my father will have died for nothing.

341
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,900
Jack...

342
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,090
for me.

343
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,070
Henderson is secure.

344
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,510
When he regains consciousness,

345
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,680
I don't want you going anywhere near him. You don't even talk to him.You understand me?

346
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,610
I understand.

347
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,480
We have to assume his people are still looking for him.

348
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,150
They're gonna be monitoring all non-vpn cell traffic,

349
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,260
which means, you can't make or receive any calls unless they come from me.

350
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,830
Here's wexler's cell.

351
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,940
I've got the number.

352
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
All right.

353
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,070
Audrey, I don't feel right about this.

354
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,610
I'm going to be all right.

355
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,010
I'm so sorry.

356
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,810
Jack, you have to go now.

357
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,980
Jack?

358
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,270
Make sure you get that recording.

359
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,220
I will.

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,800
Let me know as soon as you're done.

361
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,200
Vladimir bierko has regained consciousness.

362
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
But we're still waiting for the medical assessment

363
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,400
to be finished before we can begin the interrogation.

364
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,200
Let me know when they give us the go ahead.

365
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,600
Final protocol shifts.

366
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,550
You can tell Washington the transfer of authority

367
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,500
from CTU to homeland is officially complete.

368
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Okay.

369
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,900
Two hours ahead of schedule, Karen.

370
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,700
That is remarkable.

371
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm sorry,my head is somewhere else.

372
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,000
Where?

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,500
We gave the president Bauer's location over an hour ago.

374
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,400
We should have heard something by now.

375
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,700
The military authority is handling Bauer.

376
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,300
Yes, I know,

377
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
but this doesn't make any sense.

378
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,700
The president insisted  we redirect our focus from Henderson to Bauer.

379
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,600
We find Bauer,

380
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,500
and then he hands the mission over to the military.

381
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,900
Karen, we're out of that loop.

382
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,400
Karen Hayes.

383
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,100
Ma'am, we have a problem.

384
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,600
Chloe O'brian got out of holding,

385
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,500
and as far as I can tell,

386
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,000
she's not in the building.

387
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,500
Not in the building?

388
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,600
How's that possible?

389
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm still gathering the details.

390
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
But I reviewed the surveillance tape,

391
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,600
and it looks like Shari had a conversation with her,

392
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,900
and Shari let her go.

393
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,700
Shari didn't try to stop her? Why?

394
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,500
I don't know.

395
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,700
She won't tell me. I had security take her into custody.

396
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,500
Good. Bring her up here right now.

397
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,700
We need to focus on how we find Chloe now.

398
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,300
My guess is she'll try to contact Bauer.

399
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,700
I agree, but how?

400
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,500
She was using CTU resources before to help Bauer.

401
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,900
Maybe she'll try that again.

402
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,200
Which means she could try to access our system remotely.

403
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,700
All she needs is a laptop.

404
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
That's right.

405
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,200
She'll disguise her traffic.

406
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
Can you get through that?

407
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,900
I can trace her physical location by looking at the binaries.

408
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Do it.

409
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Wait outside.

410
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Why did you let Chloe escape?

411
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,900
She intimidated me.

412
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,500
She intimidated you?

413
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,900
Sit down.

414
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,300
You are in a great deal trouble,miss Rothenberg.

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,100
You had better start talking to me now.

416
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,300
She said she'd recommend me for psychiatric evaluation.

417
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,400
I'd lose my job.

418
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,300
I'm sorry, Ms. Hayes.

419
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
There's something wrong with me,I know that.

420
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,200
-Shari...  -and I should probably see someone...

421
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
Shari!

422
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,500
Did Chloe tell you why she was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

423
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,400
She thinks Jack is innocent.

424
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
Based on what?

425
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:49,000
Based on some absurd idea that president Logan framed Bauer.

426
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,100
She even said something about president Logan

427
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,200
being involved inthe assassination of David Palmer.

428
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
I mean, can you believe her?

429
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,200
And people think I'm crazy.

430
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,300
Damn it, open this door!

431
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
I don't know what you think you're doing,

432
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,400
but you'd better think again!

433
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,100
Unlock it.

434
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,300
Open it!

435
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,900
Charles.

436
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,000
I want that man arrested!

437
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,300
And I want know where aaron Pierce is.

438
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,900
Martha, calm down.

439
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,900
All right?

440
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,300
Aaron's fine.

441
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,500
I just transferred him back to Washington,that's all.

442
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,100
In the middle of the night?

443
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,700
Doesn't make any sense.

444
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,100
And why am i locked in this room?

445
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,000
'Cause we need to talk.

446
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,300
About what?

447
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,500
Martha, I've been wanting to tell you this,

448
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,300
but I told myself that you were too fragile to handle it.

449
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,300
But that's not the truth.

450
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,600
The truth is,

451
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,900
I've kept this from you because it's horrible and because it's ugly.

452
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,200
What are you talking about?

453
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,100
What happened to David Palmer wasn't supposed to happen.

454
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,600
He put himself in harm's way,

455
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,200
and he got involved with something that he shouldn't have.

456
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,300
What are you saying?

457
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,100
That I never authorized his death.

458
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
You... mean...

459
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
you know who killed David?

460
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Yes.

461
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,900
How do you know that?

462
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,200
He works for me.

463
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,000
What?

464
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,400
Martha,it's very complicated.

465
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,800
-What?!  -There's an explanation.

466
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,400
What?! An explanation?!

467
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,300
Oh, my god!

468
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:42,800
Stop!

469
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,300
Go to hell!

470
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,600
Stop! You don't understand!

471
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,200
Oh, my god!

472
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,700
You're involved in David's murder.

473
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,100
Martha...

474
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,600
oh, my god,

475
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,300
oh, my god.

476
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,800
Why are you telling me this?

477
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,900
Because you're on your way to finding out the truth on your own.

478
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,200
and because you need to stop.

479
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,700
Stop what?

480
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,000
You have to stop asking questions,

481
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
you have to stop talking about this to everyone.

482
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,700
Never again.

483
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,550
Martha, do you realize how traumatic this would be

484
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,800
be for the country if people were to find out?

485
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Yes, we're worried about the country.

486
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,500
Damn it, Martha!

487
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,300
That's the most important part of this!

488
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,800
This scandal would destroy the american people's faith in their government.

489
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,000
It would destroy our credibility

490
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
all over the world.

491
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,100
You lied to me.

492
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,300
Everything.

493
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,900
This whole day has been one giant lie.

494
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
What you've done makes me sick!

495
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,300
Martha, enough!

496
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,500
I know that what I did,

497
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,200
what I allowed to happen,

498
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,000
was a mistake.

499
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,100
It was a terrible mistake.

500
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
But it's done.

501
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,800
Right now,

502
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,300
I need you to swear to me that you will do as I ask...

503
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,200
for the country, Martha.

504
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I've forgiven you many things, Charles,

505
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,300
but not this.

506
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
You've broken my heart.

507
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,200
I'm looking at you...

508
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,300
I hate you.

509
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,300
But I will keep my mouth shut.

510
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,100
Because the people of this country don't deserve to suffer.

511
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,500
You do, Charles.

512
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,700
You do.

513
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,900
Are you sure we're going to get through this the way we planned?

514
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
What does that mean?

515
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,100
There's too many loose ends.

516
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,100
What operation doesn't have loose ends?

517
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,700
Of course we're not going to get through this the way we planned.

518
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,800
No one ever does.

519
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,900
I have never made a deal in my life

520
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,900
that didn't feel like it was going to fall apart in the 11th hour.

521
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,100
Now, if you don't have the stomach to deal with a few bumps,

522
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,000
then this is not the room where you belong.

523
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,000
And that goes for all of you.

524
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,500
You're starting to have doubts.

525
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
I can smell it,

526
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,700
and I don't like it.

527
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,500
You need to remember the strength we had 18 months ago when we started this thing.

528
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,700
We okay, Ron?

529
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,100
Think about your kids.

530
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,100
That's what I do when I need to get focused.

531
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,100
The situation with Martha is taken care of.

532
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I spoke to her.

533
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,200
And?

534
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,000
And I made it very clear that if she continues with this behavior,

535
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I will send her back to the hospital in vermont.

536
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,200
you were going to have her committed earlier today.

537
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,100
But you changed your mind?

538
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,200
It's because she found out the truth.

539
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,100
And I decided I should keep her close.

540
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,800
What if she finds out the truth again?

541
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,000
She won't.

542
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And if she does,

543
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,300
I will handle it,

544
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,600
just like i have all day.

545
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,800
Okay.

546
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,300
Fair enough.

547
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,300
You have done a remarkable job today, Mr. President.

548
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,000
I will admit that.

549
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,100
Thank you.

550
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,500
It's about time I heard some words of appreciation.

551
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,000
Listen to me,

552
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,100
we were just talking about how you've had to be on the front line through this,

553
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,800
how you've had to get your hands dirty,

554
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,600
while we could just sit back

555
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,900
and watch from a safe distance.

556
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,800
You've earned our trust.

557
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,100
And I am sure...

558
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,100
that you will do whatever it takes to keep your wife in line.

559
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,700
Audrey.

560
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,100
Where's Jack?

561
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,100
Audrey.

562
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,900
I'm sorry about your father.

563
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,100
I never intended your father to get in the middle of this.

564
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,300
I've known secretary Heller a very long time.

565
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,100
He's an honorable man.

566
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
What time is it?

567
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,000
It's ten to 12 minutes since...

568
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,700
if those windows didn't collapse when that car hit the water,

569
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,100
it could have created an air pocket or something.

570
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,500
20, 30 minutes in a submerged car, even at 100 feet,

571
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,700
if there was an air pocket.

572
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,500
Stop it.

573
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,100
Your father could be alive.

574
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,900
secretary...

575
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,400
secretary Heller could be alive inside that car.

576
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,500
If he's alive, you got to do something about it.

577
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,400
I mean, if there's a possibility that he's living,

578
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,100
you got to call military authority or the emergency services or something.

579
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,600
I mean, for god's sake, he's your father.

580
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,300
Stop it! Stop it!

581
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Stop! Stop! Stop!

582
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,000
Stop talking!

583
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,000
What, do you think I'm stupid?

584
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,200
You want me to make that phone call so that your people can find me.

585
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,000
Audrey, my people are going to find us anyway.

586
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
And Jack's not going to stop all this.

587
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,900
I'm trying to help your father.

588
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,600
Your father's drowning in a car,

589
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,900
and you're not doing anything about it.

590
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
You're gonna live with that the rest of your life.

591
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,600
Shut up.

592
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,800
He is dying,

593
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,700
and you are doing nothing, Audrey.

594
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,000
You are doing nothing.

595
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,900
I swear to god,

596
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,100
not another word.

597
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,600
Jack.

598
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,300
I've got a visual on the plane.

599
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,800
It must be some kind of diplomatic flight.

600
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,900
There's a lot of security on the ground.

601
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,000
We have a problem.

602
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,700
What?

603
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,600
I've been tracking the helicopter that Henderson's men used to shadow secretary Heller.

604
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,100
And?

605
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,000
It changed course,

606
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
it's heading towards where Audrey's holding Henderson.

607
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,900
How could they find them?

608
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,400
I don't know--

609
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,300
maybe they're using satellite imagery, too.

610
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,200
The point is, they're going to be there any second.

611
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,100
Where's Curtis?

612
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,300
Based on the speed of the chopper,

613
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,200
he might not make it there before Henderson's men, Jack.

614
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,000
Upload your visual to my pda.

615
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,100
Advise Curtis of the situation,

616
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll get back to you.

617
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,300
Jack?

618
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,500
Audrey,listen to me.

619
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,300
Henderson's men have zeroed in on your location,

620
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,800
they're heading back towards you.

621
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,500
You've got to get out of there now.

622
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,700
And just leave him?

623
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,500
We don't have a choice.

624
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Yes, we do, Jack.

625
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,400
I have the gun and I can kill him.

626
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,800
Audrey, we need him alive.

627
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,000
Curtis's team is almost there,

628
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
they'll track him down and they will secure him.

629
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,100
You've got to get out of there.

630
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,200
Jack, he's responsible for the death of my father's death.

631
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,300
I can't just leave him here!

632
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,800
Audrey, please,

633
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,200
listen to what I'm telling you.

634
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
You've got to start moving now.

635
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,500
Audrey!

636
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Stipes, get over and get these handcuffs off me.

637
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,100
Heller's daughter's somewhere in this building--

638
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,800
kill her.

639
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,400
Then get back here,

640
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
we'll deal with Bauer.

641
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,500
Audrey, it's me.

642
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,800
Stay down.

643
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,900
Secure him for transport back to CTU.

644
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,000
-You okay?  -Yeah.

645
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,400
Hostiles are down and we have Henderson in custody.

646
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,500
Yeah?

647
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,300
It's me.

648
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,000
What's happening?

649
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,800
Curtis's team killed Henderson's men

650
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,400
and they're taking Henderson into custody.

651
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,900
Jack, I tried to shoot him,

652
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,800
but I couldn't.

653
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,300
The only thing that matters is that you're safe.

654
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,200
I'm fine.

655
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,400
You sure?

656
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,900
Yeah.

657
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,900
Okay, good.

658
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
Let me speak to Curtis.

659
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,600
Curtis?

660
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,300
It's Jack.

661
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,100
Go ahead.

662
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,500
Yeah, Jack?

663
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,100
Curtis, I want you to transport Audrey  back to CTU as quickly as possible.

664
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
And get her over to medical.

665
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,900
And I want you to tell Karen Hayes

666
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
that no one is have access to Christopher Henderson.

667
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
She'll be taken care of.

668
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
But as far as Henderson goes,

669
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,800
CTU is more interested in apprehending  you than taking your advice.

670
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Just do what you can.

671
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,300
I'll get back to you.

672
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,300
Jack, is Audrey all right?

673
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,200
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

674
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,000
Curtis is in control of the situation.

675
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,700
Chloe, what have you got on the plane?

676
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,100
The details just came in.

677
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,400
You were right, it is a chartered diplomatic flight,

678
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,500
security-level eight,

679
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
scheduled to leave at 2:00 A.M. or sooner.

680
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,700
Okay, we need to find out who's onboard so we can try

681
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,900
and figure out who Henderson passed off the recording to.

682
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,500
I'll try--

683
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,100
it's not going to be easy getting past  the state department's firewall.

684
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,100
I understand.

685
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,100
Bill, see if you could slow down  the departure of this flight

686
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
so I can figure out a way to get on it.

687
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,600
All right, Jack.

688
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,400
There's a maintenance gate on  the northwest side of the airfield.

689
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,300
You should be able to get close to the plane there.

690
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,400
I know, I'm there.

691
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,000
Just get back to me as soon as  you've got the passenger list.

692
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,900
Yeah?

693
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,900
Jack, we've tried everything we can

694
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,600
there's no way to delay the plane.

695
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,400
It's taking off in less than ten minutes.

696
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,100
Okay.

697
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,700
Has Chloe got the passenger list yet?

698
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,300
I still can't get past the firewall.

699
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,900
Chloe, I need that list.

700
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,200
Jack, I'm trying.

701
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,400
There you are.

702
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,800
-Yeah?  -I got O'brian.

703
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,200
Did you find her on our system?

704
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,600
Yes, she's using one of our nodes to try  to log-in to the state department network.

705
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,500
Do we know why?

706
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,200
No, but she was using a work  around I'd never seen before.

707
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,300
So I machine-coded a matrix to get through...

708
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,800
miles, we just need to find her.

709
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,500
Where she is?

710
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,300
I'm running a physical trace.

711
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
It's a private house.

712
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,000
Cross-referencing with property records.

713
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,300
Karen...

714
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,900
she's working out of Bill Buchanan's house.

715
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,200
Are you sure?

716
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,800
Positive.

717
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,600
We have a tac team not far away.

718
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,000
I'll dispatch them now.

719
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,100
What's their eta?

720
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,300
I'm showing less then seven minutes.

721
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,500
Good, keep me posted.

722
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,100
Novick.

723
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,700
Mike, it's Karen Hayes.

724
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,700
Karen.

725
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,400
How are things going over there?

726
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,100
It's a rough transition from CTU to homeland,

727
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,100
but we're getting through it.

728
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,600
That's good to hear.What do you need?

729
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,600
I need some clarification.

730
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,200
We were sent over here on  a directive from the white house,

731
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,000
but we've been dealing exclusively  with vice president gardner

732
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,600
until about two hours ago.

733
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,200
What happened two hours ago?

734
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,900
The president called me himself

735
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and ordered me to arrest Jack Bauer on  evidence he was unwilling to share with me.

736
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,500
Yes.

737
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,700
I know about that.

738
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,900
Have you seen the evidence?

739
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,100
No, actually, I-I haven't.

740
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,700
Mike...

741
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,400
who has seen it?

742
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,000
I don't have a good answer for that.

743
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,500
Are you telling me you're not in the loop?

744
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,100
Actually...

745
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,900
I don't even think there is a loop.

746
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,300
The president is keeping his own counsel at the moment.

747
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's a first.

748
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,800
Yes. It is.

749
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,000
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

750
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,500
Uh, nothing that I can say with any authority.

751
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
All I know is that...

752
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,600
it's been a strange night.

753
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,100
I see.

754
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,800
I wish I could be more helpful.

755
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,200
No, mike, actually,

756
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,800
you've been very helpful.

757
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,500
Thank you.

758
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,900
Hello?

759
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,600
This is Karen Hayes.

760
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,500
You have less than seven minutes to get Chloe out of there.

761
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,100
Karen, I don't know what you're talking about,

762
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,900
Chloe's not here.

763
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,800
Bill, stop.

764
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,200
Miles traced Chloe through  a remote node she's accessing.

765
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,300
And if you don't believe me,

766
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,400
tell her he used a machine-coded matrix to find her.

767
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,300
Karen, why are you warning us?

768
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,300
Because I may have made a mistake earlier.

769
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,500
A lot of things have not made sense today,

770
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,700
until Shari told me what Chloe said.

771
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,900
About president Logan being... involved.

772
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,000
I've got to go.

773
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,600
Just get out of there, now.

774
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,000
Chloe, we have to go.

775
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,000
I can't leave yet.

776
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
Jack needs the passenger list.

777
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,900
Chloe, if they find you here,

778
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,600
you'll be arrested.

779
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,700
You have to go now!

780
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,800
Not yet.

781
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,000
It's the last one!

782
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,800
Let's get this thing out of here.
