1
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,630
I'm on the phone with a man who claims to James Nathanson.

2
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,030
He was Walt Cummings' contact.

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,730
He says he has information about the terrorists,

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,230
but he will only talk to you.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,230
What do you want with me?

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,430
Protection.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,430
The terrorists you're after are trying to kill me.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,790
What makes you think I'm not gonna kill you myself?

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,130
Because you want to stop

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,760
the Sentox gas from being released on American soil.

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,660
So do I.

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,460
Nathanson, stay down!

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,030
Stay down!

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,430
What's on the chip? Please, what's on the chip!

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,330
O'Brian.

16
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,230
I have a thumb drive that's gonna help us find the Sentox.

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,560
The decryption element kicked out a company

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,260
called Omicron International.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,000
Pull up their senior executive roster,

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,800
See if a man named Christopher Henderson's on the list.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,830
Okay, here it is.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
Senior Vice President of Research and Development.

23
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,960
Send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.

24
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,730
That's gonna be a little bit hard to do right now, Jack.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,230
The two of you are up to something, and I'm not gonna stand for it.

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,360
This is a deliberate attempt to circumvent my authority.

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,860
- Lynn, we're all on the same side. - If you're father wasn't the Secretary of

28
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,590
Defense, I'd have you thrown out of here.

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,130
I don't have that problem with you.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,630
I spent a year securing a weapon

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,330
that would bring Moscow to its knees.

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
And you waste it.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,360
We were betrayed, Bierko.

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,430
- Someone must pay. - I agree.

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,700
This is President Logan. What is it you want?

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,460
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.

37
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,530
If you refuse to cooperate,

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,760
I will have no choice but to release

39
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,300
all the Sentox nerve gas.

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,060
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

41
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,530
Don't negotiate with them!

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,830
Isn't that the point of the treaty you just signed?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,600
Mr. President, I'm glad that we have this opportunity

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,700
to thank you

45
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,200
and Mrs. Logan

46
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,330
for your hospitality.

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,860
The motorcade will take

48
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,500
service roads to the 118...

49
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,100
- Mrs. Logan... - Aaron,

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,630
I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovs.

51
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,800
I'll ride up front.

52
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,360
No, that's not necessary.

53
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,530
Yes, it is.

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,770
The following takes place between 4Pm and 5Pm

55
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,430
Yes?

56
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,030
- Where is the motorcade now? - Just getting on the 118.

57
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,130
How long before they reach the ambush point?

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
About 40 minutes.

59
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,430
Good. We'll be waiting.

60
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,430
Get everything ready.

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,930
Mr. President, I asked Secret Service

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,730
to sent a threat assessment

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,730
for President Suvarov's route.

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,200
The most vulnerable point

65
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,400
is here, the downtown corridor.

66
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,600
This is the most likely point of attack.

67
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,800
If an ambush were to occur.

68
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,430
It's going to happen, Mike.

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,000
We gave the terrorists Suvarov's route.

70
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,930
I need to come up with a public response.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,430
I need to convince the world that

72
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,360
Suvarov's death only underscores the importance

73
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,900
of this antiterrorism treaty

74
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,760
that we just signed.

75
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,260
I'll, uh, begin working on a statement, sir.

76
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,960
Yes?

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,130
Thank you. I'll... let the president know.

78
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,560
What? What is it, Mike?

79
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,100
What's going on?

80
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Who was that?

81
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,500
Agent Pierce. Um,

82
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,330
- I don't know how to tell you this. - Just tell me.

83
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,800
Mrs. Logan is riding with the Suvarovs.

84
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,200
- What are you talking about? - Sir, she got into that limousine.

85
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,300
Oh, my God.

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,460
Didn't-didn't the Secret Service

87
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,430
try to stop her?!

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,430
There was no reason to stop her.

89
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,830
The motorcade is under Secret Service escort.

90
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,560
As far as they're concerned, she's not in any danger.

91
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,430
She wants me to call back

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,600
the motorcade-- she's trying to save the Suvarovs.

93
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,130
Should I alert them?

94
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,760
Yes!

95
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,460
No, stop, wait.

96
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,700
If we warn them, the terrorists are going to set off the gas.

97
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,580
Where are they now?

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,130
They're still on the 118.

99
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,700
Get my wife on the phone.

100
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,000
My aunt visited Los Angeles

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,200
in the 1950s.

102
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,760
She told me this area was filled with orange groves,

103
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,830
but I haven't seen any.

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,300
I suppose it's all been built over, no?

105
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,590
Martha?

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,260
Yes. I-I... I was just trying to remember.

107
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,460
Um, I think your aunt's memory is better than mine.

108
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,930
I visited here when I was a child,

109
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,360
but I don't recall the orange groves.

110
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,430
Yeah, this is Pierce.

111
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,730
Let me speak to my wife.

112
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,630
Mrs. Logan,

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,700
- It's the president for you on line one. - Thank you, Aaron.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,960
Hello, Charles.

115
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,960
Listen to me carefully.

116
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,160
I want you...

117
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Yes, I think they had a wonderful visit.

118
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,690
And they would very much like for us to come to Moscow.

119
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,690
Wouldn't that be lovely?

120
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,860
I want you to tell the Suvarovs that I need you back here.

121
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,760
I'm gonna have one of the follow cars bring you back.

122
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,260
- I don't think so, Charles. - Tell them now, while I'm on the phone.

123
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,330
Martha,

124
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,300
I know that you want me to call the motorcade back, but...

125
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,590
the terrorists were very specific:

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,330
if-if I don't allow them to attack the motorcade,

127
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,630
they're gonna release

128
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,660
canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations.

129
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,560
Well, I... guess we'll just have to figure something out

130
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,630
before that happens. We're trying! We're trying,

131
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,000
but we haven't found them yet.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,730
You need to get out of the car.

133
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,860
- Okay, I should go now, but you'll call me. - Martha...

134
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,890
- If there's any change of plans? - Damn it, Martha!

135
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,300
Okay, bye-bye. I'll-I'll talk to you soon.

136
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,300
She won't get out of the limousine.

137
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,130
My God.

138
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,830
We got to do something, Mike; we got to get her out of the car.

139
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,000
I could have, uh, one of the trail cars

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,690
stop them and force her out, say that I need her back here.

141
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,890
You could, but... if Martha

142
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,000
is desperate to save the Suvarovs,

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,030
she might feel that the only remaining option

144
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,960
is to tell them the truth.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,930
And Suvarov will know that I gave him up for assassination.

146
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,960
Sir,

147
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,560
do you want me to recall the motorcade or not?

148
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,790
Edgar, meet me in the server room

149
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
in a few minutes.

150
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
- Am I in trouble? - No, but there's something

151
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,400
very important that we need to discuss.

152
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,630
- Okay. - And, Edgar,

153
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,400
don't tell anyone where you're going.

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,700
This needs to stay between us. Sure.

155
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,230
What did Audrey Raines want?

156
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,930
She was just going over some DOD protocols.

157
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,160
I thought you were supposed to be monitoring chatter.

158
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,230
- We are. - Why isn't it on my screen, Carrie?

159
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,460
I didn't think you wanted us to mirror

160
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,900
everything to your system.

161
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,830
- I thought you wanted to save time. - I do want to save time.

162
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,340
It saves me time by not having to clean up more mistakes.

163
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,000
Mirror everything until we've secured this nerve gas.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,830
Is that clear?

165
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,260
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,000
The thumb drive data Jack sent us checks out as authentic.

167
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,790
It's time-stamped by DOD and CIA.

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,000
So Omicron International did make Sentox gas for the military.

169
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,130
Yeah, and some terrorists found out about it.

170
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,660
Or worse-- they were in contact with Omicron.

171
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,960
Who is this Henderson?

172
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,230
Christopher Henderson, Senior Vice President, R&D.

173
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,970
Jack said he knew him, but he wouldn't talk about it.

174
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,600
Is he connected with the Sentox?

175
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,500
- Doesn't say; it just said he was a senior VP. - All right.

176
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,260
Yeah?

177
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,100
Jack, we've authenticated the thumb drive data.

178
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,700
Omicron definitely made the Sentox for the military.

179
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,400
Okay, I'm almost there-- look, I need you

180
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,830
to work something up that gets me through

181
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,360
the front door without them knowing I'm CTU.

182
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,000
Do you think it's necessary to go in covertly?

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,460
Yeah. There's someone I need to talk to.

184
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,510
I don't want him to see me coming.

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,630
Christopher Henderson?

186
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,750
Yeah.

187
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,560
Who is he?

188
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,730
Someone I used to work for.

189
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,360
Where?

190
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,960
CTU. He was the man who recruited me.

191
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,900
You've never mentioned him.

192
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,730
I know.

193
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,260
Things ended badly between us.

194
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,630
What happened?

195
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I was part of an investigation that uncovered evidence

196
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,500
that implicated him in the sale

197
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,330
of classified intelligence to defense contractors.

198
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,860
We never had enough evidence to indict him,

199
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,330
but he lost his job, his command.

200
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,500
Even as he was walking out the door,

201
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,560
he maintained his innocence.

202
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,430
He never forgave me for being part of the investigation.

203
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,430
Are you convinced he did it?

204
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,430
I was at the time.

205
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Jack, Chloe can't find a direct connection

206
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,030
between the Sentox and Henderson.

207
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,330
Trust me,

208
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,800
if Omicron was making Sentox, legally or illegally,

209
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,900
Henderson knew about it.

210
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,100
Get back to me as soon as you got my cover.

211
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,000
All right,I'm on it.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,330
What are you doing here, Chloe?

213
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,460
Same thing you're doing here.

214
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,260
Edgar, thank you for coming.

215
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,530
Look, whatever this is about, I don't have a lot of time.

216
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,730
We don't have a single active lead on this nerve gas.

217
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,130
That's not exactly true.

218
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,260
Jack is following a lead out in the field.

219
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,430
- How do you know? - I just spoke with him.

220
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,860
Everyone's looking for him. Lynn issued an arrest warrant.

221
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,000
That's why we wanted to talk to you, Edgar.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,130
Lynn is losing it-- first he went after Jack,

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
and then he took Bill Buchanan out of play.

224
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,700
Lynn is incapable of leading us through this crisis.

225
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,730
- So you're both working behind his back? - We're afraid that if

226
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,800
we bring him into this, he might derail the only good lead that we have.

227
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,800
We have to help Jack locate the nerve gas

228
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,830
before it's too late.

229
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,600
What do you want from me?

230
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,060
Cover for Chloe until Jack reports back.

231
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,460
Please.

232
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,860
- Okay. - Thank you.

233
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,200
Okay, fine. Yeah.

234
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,630
That was Secret Service.

235
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,400
As you can see, the motorcade continues

236
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,360
to make its way to the airport without incident.

237
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,160
There won't be any warning, Mike.

238
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,830
When these people attack,

239
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,530
they will be fast and they will be merciless.

240
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,260
You can count on that.

241
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,630
I have to talk to this man.

242
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,060
M-Maybe I can convince him to hold off.

243
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,660
Hold off?

244
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,200
Just until Martha gets out of the car.

245
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,030
She wasn't supposed to be a part of this in the first place.

246
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,430
Sir, I don't think that would change his plan.

247
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,360
He has to know that my wife's in the car!

248
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,330
I can't lose her, Mike.

249
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,360
The only way to keep Martha safe

250
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,900
is for me to call Secret Service

251
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
and tell them to turn

252
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,800
the motorcade around.

253
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,160
What about... what about CTU?

254
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,700
Do they have any active leads

255
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,900
on the nerve gas?

256
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,160
As of five minutes ago, they don't...

257
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,660
nothing that would help our situation.

258
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,730
What am I missing, Mike?!

259
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,900
There's got to be some way out,

260
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,230
something that I'm not seeing.

261
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,860
You're not missing anything.

262
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,760
Any action we take to save Martha

263
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,500
would also save the Suvarovs,

264
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,160
and if that happens,

265
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,430
the terrorists will release the gas.

266
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,860
Unfortunately,

267
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,830
it's that simple.

268
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,260
Then there's nothing more we can do, Mike.

269
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,060
Unless I warn them.

270
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,300
Martha's going to die with the Suvarovs.

271
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,960
Aaron... have there been any changes?

272
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,200
Excuse me?

273
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,230
Changes to what, Mrs. Logan?

274
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,460
I-I was just wondering

275
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,960
if there had been any changes to our route.

276
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,400
We haven't gotten

277
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,830
any revised instructions, ma'am.

278
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,960
Thank you.

279
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,360
You sure you're all right, Martha?

280
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,700
Yes, yes. I just wanted to make sure

281
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,900
we don't run into any heavy traffic.

282
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,860
Understood.

283
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,310
Those protocols should be coming over shortly.

284
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,860
Who were you on the phone with?

285
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,720
Homeland Security.

286
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,180
I gave you specific orders

287
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,870
to have everyone's systems mirrored to mine.

288
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,600
I've been doing that.

289
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,120
But you're not finished, yet somehow you have time

290
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,390
to chat with Homeland Security.

291
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,570
They needed us to give them updated code sets.

292
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,430
- It'll just take another minute. - No, it won't.

293
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,660
Stiles, finish her task.

294
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,780
Carrie, you're done.

295
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,210
What do you... mean, done?

296
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,760
Fired. You don't work here anymore.

297
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,350
Mr. McGill,

298
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,680
it's not her fault. She just...

299
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,600
Edgar, one more word out of you, you walk out with her.

300
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,660
What's it gonna be?

301
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,500
Where's Agent O'Brian?

302
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,230
She had to step away for a minute. Where?

303
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,410
I don't know.

304
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,600
Ok,I'm through the gate. I'm following lead to the parking place now.

305
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,400
How is my cover?

306
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,030
Jack, I'm still trying to get your credentials into Omicron's system.

307
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,730
You can't get into the building without them.

308
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,300
What's the problem?

309
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,600
Omicron's systems don't refresh often enough.

310
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,170
We need to push this page in manually.

311
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,540
Okay, I'm in.

312
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,170
You're going in under the name of John Barrie.

313
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,880
B-A-R-R-I-E.

314
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,070
You're with a company called

315
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,070
Eclipse LLC.

316
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,140
John Barrie, Eclipse LLC.

317
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,570
I got it.

318
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,030
Hold on a second.

319
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,110
she hasn't planted it yet.

320
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,380
Chloe. What are you doing in here?

321
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,940
I asked her to help me.

322
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,880
She doesn't work for you, Ms. Raines; she works for me.

323
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,140
But I don't,

324
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,440
and DOD has assignment priority

325
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,710
over CTU.

326
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,110
We're in the middle of a real-time investigation,

327
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,680
and we're understaffed.

328
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,080
Chloe's a department head-- you can't just take her

329
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,080
- away from me. - I'm not taking her from you.

330
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,510
We needed a system patch on a server,

331
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,820
and Chloe's the only one who could fix it.

332
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,080
Well, then you come to me and you ask me.

333
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,120
Everything in this office runs through me!

334
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,520
Lynn, we are all trying to do the same thing.

335
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,650
Can we please just get past this?

336
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,690
Yeah, I'm past it. I want Chloe back.

337
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,420
Okay, I'm finished here.

338
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,760
Sorry, Mr. McGill, it won't happen again.

339
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,700
Good afternoon.

340
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,090
John Barrie with Eclipse.

341
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,530
I've got a 4:30 with R&D.

342
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,970
Thumb print, please.

343
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,140
Go on in.

344
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,840
Thank you.

345
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,980
Well, I'll tell you what you do.

346
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,880
You kick the McAvoy meeting to next week on Thursday,

347
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,010
but you keep everything else.

348
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,650
What about your trip to Washington?

349
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,350
That's right. Okay.

350
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,580
Well, I got to talk to Kagan tomorrow morning.

351
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,050
I'll get back to you then.

352
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,450
- Can I help you, sir? - Yeah, I'm sorry.

353
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,120
I'm a little lost. I was looking for the men's room.

354
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,410
Over there, second door.

355
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,950
Thank you.

356
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,450
Audrey Raines.

357
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,460
It's Jack. I need you to lose the secretary.

358
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,860
Her name is Joanna Tandy.

359
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,920
All right, I'll take care of it.

360
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,020
Thanks.

361
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,380
Christopher Henderson's office.

362
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,870
- Ms. Tandy? - Yes?

363
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,650
Jane Espenson from accounting.

364
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,080
We need you to come down now

365
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,180
and double-check some of these invoices.

366
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,730
What invoices?

367
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,770
It's a little difficult to explain over the phone.

368
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,600
Would you mind popping down just for a minute?

369
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,930
Fine.

370
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,260
Thank you.

371
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,940
Mr. Henderson, there's a problem down in accounting.

372
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,070
I'll be right back.

373
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,870
Yeah. OK.

374
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,790
Jack? Jack?

375
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,760
Just for the record, I never believed you were dead.

376
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,940
What are you doing here?

377
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,240
Earlier this morning,

378
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,890
terrorists gained control of a large quantity

379
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,610
of Sentox VX nerve gas.

380
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,940
Omicron manufactured it.

381
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,200
When I pulled up the executive list,

382
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,340
your name was on it.

383
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,020
Sure my name's on it-- I work here.

384
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,120
Omicron had the contract.

385
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,390
We manufacture this stuff.

386
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,650
But every single gram of it

387
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,690
went to the Department of Defense.

388
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,850
It's all been accounted for.

389
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,540
Well, that can't be true, now, can it?

390
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,290
We have confirmation that terrorists

391
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,360
are in control of 19 canisters of Sentox!

392
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,660
What are you accusing me now of, Jack?

393
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,340
Being in bed with terrorists?

394
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm following the leads!

395
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,610
Well, the leads are wrong.

396
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,040
DOD destroyed the entire stockpile.

397
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,820
Sentox was responsible for the death of the people

398
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,090
in the Sunrise Hills Mall less than two hours ago.

399
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,880
The news said it was chlorine gas.

400
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,450
That was a cover story

401
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,400
to stop a widespread panic!

402
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,990
Come on, Christopher, you know how this works!

403
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,330
The terrorists have threatened to release the rest of the gas.

404
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,550
Good God.

405
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,860
Well, whoever's implicating me in this

406
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,310
knows my history with CTU.

407
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,990
I mean, I'm an easy target.

408
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,340
This is not a coincidence.

409
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,080
Look, Jack, I know there's dirt between us,

410
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,830
but I swear to you,

411
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,220
I got nothing to do with this.

412
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,240
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. I can't afford to take your word on this.

413
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,350
Well, you're gonna have to take my word.

414
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,780
11 people died in that mall!

415
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,370
Hundreds of thousands of others will if they release

416
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,280
the rest of the Sentox.

417
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,730
You're not hearing me, Jack!

418
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,450
I had nothing to do with this!

419
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,400
Then prove it to me.

420
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,120
I need complete access to Omicron's Sentox program.

421
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,810
I'm doing it now.

422
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,270
The entire operation was run from a bunker across the campus.

423
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,690
Let me see the bunker.

424
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,760
NSA chatter analysis just came in.

425
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,020
I decoded some words and phrases.

426
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,200
What were they saying?

427
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,600
It's too scrambled to make any complete sentences,

428
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,000
but number strings keep coming up.

429
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,330
5, 110, 10.

430
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,860
Freeways?

431
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,860
Those are the routes President Suvarov's taking to the airport.

432
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,530
The only other phrase I could decode

433
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,260
refers to the downtown corridor.

434
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,930
How long ago did this chatter start?

435
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,630
About 30 minutes ago.

436
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,800
Come on.

437
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,500
Can we expand the search area?

438
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,760
I've got CTU air surveillance on everything east of Glendale.

439
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,530
- What about the north? - Edwards Air Force Base

440
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,460
is giving us support there.

441
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,630
We're still at a dead end

442
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,130
on finding new leads with the nerve gas.

443
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,160
Excuse me, Mr. McGill, we think there might be an attack

444
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,600
on President Suvarov's motorcade.

445
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:40,810
What?

446
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,360
Edgar just monitored

447
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,960
some chatter from NSA and ran a threat assessment.

448
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,570
What are you doing analyzing chatter that isn't related to finding the nerve gas?

449
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,160
It came through on one of my filters.

450
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,130
The point is, sir, we found something.

451
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,600
Don't you want to alert Secret Service

452
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,660
considering that Suvarov is on his way to the airport?

453
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,260
Based on an unsubstantiated theory

454
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,730
from a couple of analysts?

455
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,330
I think I've been embarrassed enough for one day.

456
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,330
Can we at least devote some limited resources

457
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,930
to try to confirm this threat?

458
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,930
I'm sorry.

459
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,200
Maybe I wasn't clear. No.

460
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,460
Now go downstairs

461
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,460
and focus on what you're supposed to be doing.

462
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,850
I don't think it would be a bad idea

463
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,130
to pass along the intel.

464
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,560
Well, I do.

465
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,530
I don't want to hear another word about it.

466
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,330
Yes?

467
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,660
Our men are in place.

468
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,530
How far out are they?

469
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
The motorcade will be there in less than 20 minutes.

470
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,730
Are you sure no one is going to interfere with us?

471
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,230
I don't think so.

472
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,060
Logan knows the consequences if that happens.

473
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,560
But be alert.

474
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,230
Make sure they haven't placed any of their people near you.

475
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,820
If police show up,

476
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,600
- we'll deal with them. - Good.

477
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,260
I'll call you when it's over.

478
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,230
Let's go, let's go.

479
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,460
Keep them out.

480
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,260
If things don't go as planned, I'll use them here.

481
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,080
I'm busy, Ms. Raines.

482
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,900
Lynn, I just looked at this chatter report

483
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,300
and I definitely think that we need

484
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,930
to let Secret Service know of the threat.

485
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,300
I'm not going to repeat my orders

486
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,630
to every person in this office individually.

487
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,600
My people are not going to chase that white elephant.

488
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,000
They're busy trying to locate 19 canisters

489
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,300
of Sentox nerve gas.

490
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,700
Has it occurred to you that if this threat is real,

491
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,330
then it's likely

492
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,300
that the terrorists who have the Sentox nerve gas

493
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,330
are the same ones that are planning this attack?

494
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
This is an unverified threat!

495
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,460
If you want to hand it off to NSA, be my guest.

496
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,400
NSA can't recall the motorcade without going through

497
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,160
a time-consuming approval process.

498
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,530
Good.

499
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,830
That process helps eliminate false threats.

500
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,960
Look, we don't have that time.

501
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,130
- According... - Ms. Raines

502
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,690
Ms. Raines

503
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,160
this office has made enough mistakes

504
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,000
for one day, and I intend to stop the bleeding.

505
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,360
Now let my people

506
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,630
focus on their work

507
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,630
or I will have you escorted out of here.

508
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,060
Thank you.

509
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,490
I need to call this in to Secret Service,

510
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,370
but they won't act on it

511
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,230
unless Lynn verifies it.

512
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,860
- He's never going to back you up on that. - Yes, he is.

513
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,860
I need you to hack into Lynn's account for me.

514
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,200
I'll forge a message to Secret Service

515
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,030
and make it look like it came from him.

516
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,430
- That's illegal. - Fine.

517
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,330
Edgar, I need you to put a blanket on my sub-net

518
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,900
to make it look like I'm doing something else.

519
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,030
We could all end up in jail.

520
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,200
Think about it for a second.

521
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,700
The Russian president, his wife,

522
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,660
about 35 Secret Service, all dead in a few minutes.

523
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,190
All right, but for the record, this is not a good idea.

524
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
All right, I'll compose a message.

525
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,730
As soon as you have the forged verification file, call me.

526
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,600
Curtis.

527
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,790
Excuse me. We need to talk.

528
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,030
What is it?

529
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,340
We've got a problem with Lynn.

530
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,530
Yeah, I know.

531
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,460
He's not listening to anybody.

532
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,160
Well, it's going to start costing lives.

533
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,760
Just give him some time. He'll come around.

534
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,060
Curtis, we don't have time.

535
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,590
We've got to get Bill back out here.

536
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,490
That's not going to happen, Audrey.

537
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,060
We need to make it happen.

538
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,830
What are you suggesting?

539
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,560
Section 112.

540
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,600
On what grounds?

541
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,690
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.

542
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,290
I may not agree with all his choices,

543
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,560
but going from there

544
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,960
to mentally unfit?

545
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,260
That's a stretch.

546
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,660
No, it's not and you know it.

547
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,130
You've seen him.

548
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,100
With Bill in custody, you are the ranking agent.

549
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,230
You are the only one

550
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,160
that can invoke it.

551
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,030
- I don't know, Audrey... - Yes, you do.

552
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,760
Curtis, CTU is barely functional.

553
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,590
You are the one that can turn it around.

554
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,530
Even if I agreed, Section 112 requires documentation,

555
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,960
testimony, a lot of groundwork.

556
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,200
The record of what is going on right now

557
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,960
is documentation enough.

558
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,260
Curtis...

559
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,660
please.

560
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,360
Think about it.

561
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,650
I will.

562
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,460
Good. Thank you.

563
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,730
Mr. President.

564
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,430
Come in, Mike.

565
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,830
The motorcade is only 15 minutes away from the airport.

566
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,930
Yeah.

567
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,000
My father always told me that life was about problem solving.

568
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,660
That every problem had a solution.

569
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,190
You tell me where the solution is

570
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,630
on this one.

571
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,530
I don't have an answer, Mr. President.

572
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,860
But if you want the Suvarov motorcade to turn back,

573
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,460
I need to do it now.

574
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,560
We know the terrorists are willing to kill civilians.

575
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,790
And the low... the low end of the casualty range

576
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,360
on this one is...

577
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,860
100,000 lives.

578
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,990
Yes, sir.

579
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,290
I decided before that I couldn't risk all those lives

580
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,230
to save one man-- the Russian president.

581
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:06,100
I can't risk those lives now...

582
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,460
even to save my own wife.

583
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,560
Damn you, Martha,

584
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,090
for putting me in this position.

585
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,460
You brought it on yourself.

586
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,400
Mike...

587
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,830
Pray with me, Mike.

588
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,630
Uh, Mr. President, with all due respect,

589
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,660
this is a personal matter.

590
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,390
I don't...

591
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,700
Please, Mike.

592
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,290
How much longer until we can send this out?

593
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,860
A couple of minutes. I've almost hacked in.

594
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,660
We don't have a couple of minutes.

595
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,730
I'm almost there.

596
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,700
Oh, no.

597
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,390
Lynn cut us off.

598
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,560
What do I do?

599
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,100
I think it's too late to do anything.

600
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,130
Mr. Stiles,

601
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,160
did you really think I wouldn't notice

602
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,330
that you were trying to access my com?

603
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,330
- Lynn, listen, we need to talk... - Shut up!

604
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,860
These people are working against CTU protocols.

605
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,160
That means they're working against me.

606
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,850
Lynn, what is this?

607
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,570
We were trying to warn Secret Service

608
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,880
on an attack on Suvarov's motorcade.

609
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,830
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles and Ms. O'Brian

610
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,750
put them in holding.

611
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,060
And then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.

612
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,960
I can't do that.

613
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,250
Yes, you can, Curtis.

614
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,430
It's a direct order.

615
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,100
Now do it.

616
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,030
You forced them to work covertly.

617
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,230
They had no choice.

618
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,390
You're not behaving rationally, Lynn.

619
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,030
You and you,

620
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,030
take them all into custody including Mr. Manning.

621
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,960
If you try to carry out that command,

622
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,290
I will draw my weapon.

623
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,090
If he draws his weapon, shoot him.

624
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,460
This situation is already getting out of control.

625
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,500
Don't make it worse.

626
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,530
Why are you hesitating?!

627
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,630
I gave you an order. Now do it!

628
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,090
What would you like me to do, Mr. Manning?

629
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,460
What?!

630
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,290
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you of your command

631
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,030
under the incapacity clause of Section 112.

632
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,590
You'll do no such thing.

633
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,030
Take him away.

634
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,030
You can't do that.

635
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,800
He can't do this. Don't touch me.

636
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,030
This is an unjustified usurpation of my authority.

637
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,060
Do you hear me?

638
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,360
We're in the middle of a crisis.

639
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,860
There are going to be repercussions.

640
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,530
Everyone involved in this is going to face prosecution.

641
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,890
This is Curtis Manning.

642
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,190
Release Bill Buchanan from holding

643
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,960
and inform Division that he's been reinstated

644
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,630
as director of CTU

645
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,830
under Section 112 provisions.

646
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,740
Everyone, get back to your stations.

647
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,660
- Fill me in. - Chloe and Edgar detected chatter

648
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,990
indicating a possible attack on President Suvarov's motorcade

649
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,530
- en route to the airport. - How'd they get Suvarov's route?

650
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,060
We don't know, but the most likely

651
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
point of intercept is the downtown corridor.

652
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,530
- Has Secret Service been notified? - Lynn refused to do so.

653
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,130
Notify Secret Service now. I need your

654
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,430
level one access code to override the firewall Lynn put up.

655
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,790
- Here. - I need Carrie back.

656
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,600
- He fired her for no reason. - Have security reinstate her.

657
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,730
Edgar, pull up satellite and all possible intercept points,

658
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,530
and call the president.

659
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,500
Yes, sir.

660
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,350
Where are we on the location of the nerve gas canisters?

661
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,090
No substantial progress.

662
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,660
What about the lead Jack was following? He traced the Sentox

663
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,260
back to Omicron International where it was manufactured.

664
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,400
Is that where Jack is now?

665
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
- Yes. - Mr. Buchanan,

666
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,310
president's on the line.

667
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,530
Mr. President, we have intelligence

668
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,630
that indicates President Suvarov's motorcade

669
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,630
may be attacked in the next few minutes.

670
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,580
Is that so?

671
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,330
Yes, sir.

672
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,760
We are in the process of notifying Secret Service.

673
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,460
What we can tell you is that if the attack happens

674
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,830
it will occur in or around the downtown area.

675
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,630
The motorcade is approaching that area now, sir.

676
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,060
Mr. President?

677
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,390
Bill. Mike Novick.

678
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,260
The president is at a loss for words.

679
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,700
His wife is in the Suvarov's limousine.

680
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,700
Thank you. You've done a good job.

681
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,930
What do we do?

682
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,990
There's nothing we can do, sir.

683
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,490
CTU is informing the Secret Service.

684
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,660
They'll no doubt take defensive measures,

685
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,890
which makes the attack

686
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,160
substantially less likely to succeed.

687
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,330
Protocol red.

688
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,990
Protocol red. Hold on tight.

689
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,860
We're turning around-- we just received intelligence

690
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,600
about a threat to the motorcade.

691
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,230
They're turning around!

692
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,830
We're under attack!

693
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,830
We need backup now!

694
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,500
It's a missile fire. The motorcade's been hit.

695
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,490
A-Aaron?

696
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,930
Aaron?

697
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,560
Oh, my God...

698
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,630
Are you okay?

699
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,290
Novick.

700
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,260
Yeah, Frank.

701
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,090
How badly?

702
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,600
And what about Mrs. Logan?

703
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,860
I will. Thank you.

704
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,130
Your wife survived the attack.

705
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,960
CTU intervened in time.

706
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,530
Thank God.

707
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,330
What about the Suvarovs?

708
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:58,460
They were shaken up, but, uh, they'll be okay.

709
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,460
He's going to think I tipped off CTU.

710
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,960
It won't matter to him that I tried to keep

711
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
my end of the bargain.

712
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,930
I agree.

713
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,230
All the work on the Sentox project was run out of here.

714
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,230
How restricted was the access?

715
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,760
Extremely. For security reasons, each defense contract

716
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,800
was run out of its own separate dedicated bunker,

717
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,930
each bunker's a completely sealed environment.

718
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,600
Nothing gets in and nothing gets out.

719
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,580
This is gonna take some time.

720
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,750
I've got to merge some files,

721
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,460
find out who's working on this project.

722
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,160
You're Senior Vice President and you don't know?

723
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,860
Give me a break, Jack-- there's 8,000 people

724
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,950
that work for this company.

725
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,830
I got to run a sort-- it's gonna take me a minute.

726
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,860
So who's the honcho over at CTU now?

727
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,370
Bill Buchanan.

728
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,930
Buchanan. What a stiff.

729
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,930
No wonder everything's going to hell over there.

730
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,560
You guys keep getting rid

731
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,680
of everybody who can do their job.

732
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,600
You made your own bed.

733
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,300
You accused the wrong man, Jack.

734
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,660
I wasn't the lead investigator; I showed them what I found.

735
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,960
- I was framed. - By who?

736
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,660
Nina Myers, George Mason... Who knows?

737
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,930
But I'll tell you, the one thing that just hangs on me,

738
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,760
I'll tell you, the one thing that just...

739
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,500
hurts me is that you didn't believe me.

740
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,390
You made it impossible to believe you.

741
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,660
How could I possibly defend you?

742
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,760
You wouldn't even defend yourself.

743
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,030
No one gave me the chance.

744
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,830
Okay, we got something here.

745
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,250
Lead scientist, head of Project Sentox--

746
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,330
Alan Burkett, PhD.

747
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,260
I'm gonna need to speak to him.

748
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,930
Well, you're gonna have a problem.

749
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,430
Died in a helicopter crash in Geneva two years ago.

750
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,020
Let's see what else we got.

751
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,560
This is bizarre.

752
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,790
Two other senior scientists on the Sentox project

753
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,560
one drowned on a diving trip in the Bahamas,

754
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,030
the other burned to death

755
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,060
in a car accident two weeks later.

756
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,330
What the hell is going on?

757
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,100
CTU's gonna have to break it down.

758
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,630
How do I upload the files and get them ready to transfer?

759
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,630
We need I.T.

760
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,660
They're next-door.

761
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,630
I'll get somebody to help us.

762
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,960
I'll CTU know that

763
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,330
we're sending the files over.

764
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,900
Hello?

765
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,900
Damn it.

766
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,330
Oh, my God.

767
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,500
How could I be so stupid?

768
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,260
- Yes? - Yeah, it's me.

769
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,430
I listened to everything Bauer had to say

770
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,810
about the thumb drive-- CTU does not have

771
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,290
enough information to hurt us.

772
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,760
What about Bauer?

773
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,330
Well, in about one minute, he'll be dead.

774
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,100
Tell the media we don't know how

775
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,330
the terrorists found out about the Suvarovs' route.

776
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,900
We're looking into it now.

777
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,300
Mike, I've been thinking that...

778
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,960
diplomatically, we should play up the fact that

779
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,160
- Martha was in the vehicle. - Why is that, sir?

780
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,500
It will get rid of any suspicion that we might

781
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,100
have been shortchanging Suvarov's security.

782
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,560
There he is.

783
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,330
Hello.

784
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,130
I thought we had an understanding.

785
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,830
I had nothing to do with this.

786
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,100
- You have to believe me. - It was your job

787
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,400
to make sure no one interfered

788
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,900
with the attack on the Suvarovs.

789
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,830
It happened outside of my authority.

790
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,430
I told no one.

791
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,530
If Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president,

792
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,360
then its new ally, the United States,

793
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:08,060
will pay with the lives of its citizens.

794
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,260
Mr. President, this is our final conversation.

795
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,000
- Good-bye. - No. Wait!
