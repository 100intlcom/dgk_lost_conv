1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,930
You helped terrorists acquire weaponized nerve gas!

2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,340
I told you we were going to trigger the canisters

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,580
once the separatists reached their base in Central Asia.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,990
Damn it, Walt, you got into bed

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,010
with these people and now

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,030
they're threatening to use the gas on American citizens!

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,350
What do we do about Walt?

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,100
We keep him out of sight long enough

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,850
for us to construct a credible narrative.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,170
Are you talking about a cover-up?

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,690
Walt Cummings was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,680
If we go public with Cummings,

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,970
the credibility of this office will be destroyed.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,880
- Mr. President... - What is it, Mike?

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,150
I think you should come here.

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,150
What's going on?

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,730
Just come here, sir.

18
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,120
- Lynn? - What is it?

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,540
I know you're busy, but I need to see you, please.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,650
Hurry up!

21
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,280
I need you to do some work for us and I need it done fast.

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,650
Get the canisters!

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,100
You have to cut precisely ten centimeters

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,980
from the bottom of the casing.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,100
You and I need a place where we can meet.

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,560
Call you back in five minutes.

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,530
Logan has asked Jack to be reinstated on a provisional basis.

28
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,420
He's been given full autonomy and access.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,810
We got a possible intercept on Erwich.

30
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,320
A man named Jacob Rossler

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,550
a software programmer indicted for high-security code infiltration.

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,610
Never convicted.

33
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,760
Copy that.

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,860
Federal agent!

35
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,660
Rossler is in custody! I repeat, Rossler is in custody!

36
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,750
Answer.

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,340
Yes?

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,480
We have the identification.

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,130
No!

40
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,190
No!

41
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,690
Is he gonna make it?

42
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,060
No. He's dead.

43
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,780
Rossler's our only link to those canisters.

44
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,140
Erwich's gonna call here any minute.

45
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,330
He's gonna expect to talk to him.

46
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,470
The following takes places between 2Pm and 3Pm

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,340
What's the situation?

48
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,500
Rossler's dead, shot by his female companion.

49
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,020
What does that do to our plan?

50
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,760
We intended to use Rossler to lead us to Erwich and the Sentox.

51
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,780
How?

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,190
Rossler was going to sell Erwich a chip

53
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,260
that would enable him to activate the canisters and release the Sentox.

54
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,340
And we put a tracker on the chip?

55
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,160
Yes, to follow Erwich back to the canisters.

56
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,080
Obviously that plan has to change.

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,850
Has Erwich set a time and place for the meeting yet?

58
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,730
No.

59
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,460
We've also picked-up increased chatter related to the canisters.

60
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,890
Related how?

61
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,340
Erwich's been putting out feelers to terrorist organizations

62
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,120
with sleeper cells established here.

63
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,110
He's asking for help launching nerve gas

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,100
attacks on larger targets, across the country.

65
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,130
There's a call coming in on Rossler's phone.

66
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,050
We assume it's Erwich.What do you want to do?

67
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,370
Put it on the speaker.

68
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,440
Jack, this has to be Erwich.

69
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,330
CTU is on line.

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,390
You ready?

71
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,150
Yeah.

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,770
Five minutes.

73
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,340
Roof of the parking garage,

74
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,210
corner of White Oak and Mattison.

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,660
One of my men will meet you.

76
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,440
Look for a blue van.

77
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,840
What do you think?

78
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,840
I think we caught a break.

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,530
Give me the chip.

80
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,790
This is Jack Bauer. Let me speak to Bill Buchanan.

81
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,890
Jack Bauer on the line.

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,190
Buchanan.

83
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,440
Bill, did you get that?

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
Yes. Erwich is sending someone else to the meeting.That's a problem.

85
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,620
No, I don't think so.It means I can pass myself off as Rossler.

86
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,260
We can keep the meeting.We can control this thing.

87
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,030
Rossler and the man Erwich is sending may know each other.

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,420
No, he said, look for a blue van.

89
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,120
He wouldn't have said that if they knew each other.

90
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,770
It's a big risk, Jack.

91
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,930
Jack, they will probably kill you,

92
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,330
even if they do think you're Rossler.

93
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,240
It ties up a loose end.

94
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,280
Well, right now, we don't have a choice. If we're lucky,

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,550
this guy will take the chip back to Erwich.

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,460
That will lead us to the nerve gas.

97
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,880
All right, Jack.

98
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,800
Do it.

99
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,320
Thank you.

100
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,270
Chloe, Edgar, Jack is gonna need you

101
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,190
to tech support him through the installation of that chip.

102
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,730
We'll pull up the schematics.

103
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,880
Already on it.

104
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,630
All right, the chip you'll be giving them is genuine,

105
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,440
but it's useless without the correct unlock code.

106
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,400
The tracker's built into the chip itself.

107
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,670
Okay. Thanks.

108
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,440
How do you want to play this?

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Passive, nonthreatening.I want these people to think I'm scared of them.

110
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,190
All right, get TAC teams ready. We're on the move.

111
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,750
You'll need a new com unit with fresh battery.

112
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,730
You'll be patched into CTU at all times.

113
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,790
With this, we'll be able to hear everything within a 20 foot radius of you.

114
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
I'll be watching your back.

115
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,470
Thanks.

116
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,990
Testing, one, two, three. Testing, one, two, three.

117
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,490
He'll be waiting for you there.

118
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,240
Let me know if there's a problem.

119
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,190
Do we have the new chip yet?

120
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,700
No.

121
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,160
I sent Polakov and Komar to meet Rossler.

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,070
They should have it in a few minutes.

123
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,860
Anything?

124
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,780
Remote will always be the most effective way of triggering the canisters.

125
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,540
I understand, but what if the new chip doesn't work?

126
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,220
I need options in case Rossler fails us.

127
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,990
There may be a workaround,

128
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,100
but someone will have to be on site with the canister.

129
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,130
Get it done.

130
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,670
Excuse me, Mr. President, I thought you should know,

131
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,330
Walt's body has been moved to the Secret Service.

132
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,000
Out building for the time being.

133
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,360
You realize, sir, we still need to

134
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,660
issue a public statement about his death.

135
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,400
No statement till his wife's been notified.

136
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,610
Of course.

137
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,460
Sir, if you don't mind me saying,

138
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,860
I think perhaps we have an opportunity here.

139
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,270
This statement you and Mrs. Logan plan to release

140
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,050
disclosing the fact that Walt was part of a conspiracy

141
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,500
to supply the terrorists with nerve gas,

142
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,600
and that he was involved in David Palmer's assassination...

143
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,820
What's your point, Mike?

144
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,990
I'm sorry, sir.

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,030
I wonder if his death might render all that moot.

146
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,530
Go on.

147
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,150
Very little will come from dragging Walt's name through the mud

148
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,330
when he's not here to answer for what he's done.

149
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,420
And it would be devastating for this country,

150
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,960
particularly, if, God forbid,

151
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,460
that nerve gas is used against us.

152
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,360
What are you suggesting?

153
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,650
We could attribute Walt's suicide to a despondency

154
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,410
over the day's events.

155
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,000
Overwork.

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,060
Personal issues.

157
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,190
Let him go out with some dignity, you mean,

158
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,720
and not as a traitor.

159
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,970
Yes, sir.

160
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,560
My wife will have a considerable problem with that.

161
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,730
Well... I respect the First Lady's moral conviction

162
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,360
but this is your decision

163
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,060
not hers.

164
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,630
Is there anything else I can get you, Mrs. Logan?

165
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,610
No, thank you, Evelyn. I'm fine.

166
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,190
Can I ask your advice on something?

167
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,610
Of course.

168
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,690
Some of the staff are asking questions.

169
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,400
About?

170
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,950
Walt Cummings' death.

171
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,560
Evelyn, I'm helping prepare a statement right now

172
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,910
that the President's gonna give later.

173
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,390
It'll explain everything.

174
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,330
Is there something else, Evelyn?

175
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,960
Yes.

176
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,720
What? What is it?

177
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,690
Why did he do it?

178
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,260
Why did Walt kill himself?

179
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,760
I deserve to know.

180
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,370
A violent thing happened to someone that I work with every day

181
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,960
someone who had no visible signs of depression.

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,770
What if it wasn't suicide?

183
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,600
What if we're in danger?

184
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,940
I don't know what to think.

185
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,510
It was suicide.

186
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,870
How can you be so sure?

187
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,470
Evelyn, listen to me.

188
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,500
What I'm going to say to you has to stay in this room

189
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,360
until its made public, do you understand?

190
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,440
You do understand?

191
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,170
Even his family doesn't know the truth yet.

192
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,300
Okay.

193
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,760
Walt Cummings was a traitor.

194
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
What?

195
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,200
I'm not going to go into any details,

196
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,340
but suffice it to say that Walt was responsible for

197
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,490
some of the awful things that have happened today.

198
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,190
I can't believe that.

199
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,070
The President just found out.

200
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,310
I suppose that Walt didn't want to face the humiliation

201
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,310
of a long public trial and...

202
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,460
and he decided to kill himself.

203
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,460
Was he working with the terrorists?

204
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Our enforcement agencies are trying to figure that out.

205
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,230
Jack's arrived at the rendezvous point.

206
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,650
Maintain your distance.

207
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,310
All right, head's up.We have a blue van entering the parking garage,

208
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,370
license plate six-Quebec-four nine-nine-five-one.

209
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,140
Repeat, six-Quebec-four, nine-nine-five-one.

210
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,010
Running the plates.

211
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,870
He's heading up the ramp towards you, Jack.

212
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,680
Couldn't get a visual on who's inside.

213
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,990
I have a hit from DMV.

214
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,200
The plates don't match the vehicle.

215
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,910
They probably stole the van and put clean plates on it.

216
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,660
Two men are getting out.

217
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,790
Show time.

218
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,160
Rossler?

219
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,550
I was told there'd only be one of you.

220
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,780
Is that a problem?

221
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,640
Yeah.I don't like surprises.

222
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,540
Relax... we've got your money.

223
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,040
Let me see it.

224
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,490
When I see the chip.

225
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,000
Erwich says you have to install it.

226
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,830
Where's the remote trigger?

227
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,580
Let's go.

228
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,910
Let's go.

229
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,730
Okay, Jack,

230
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,440
you need to remove the backing.

231
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,120
Inside, there are five jumpers.

232
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,240
Toggle the one in the middle to the left.

233
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,020
Pry out the old chip, but do it gently.

234
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,090
When it's out, clear your throat or something.

235
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,680
Okay, insert the new chip in the slot,

236
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,720
press the reset button under the slot.

237
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,530
Screw the back on, and you're done.

238
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,160
The trigger's been reconfigured you can activate the canisters now.

239
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,780
You'd better hope it works.

240
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,310
You're coming with us,

241
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,880
just to make sure.

242
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,920
What are they doing?

243
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,890
We are on the move.

244
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,780
This isn't the deal I made with Erwich.

245
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,360
I reconfigured the trigger

246
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,960
you're supposed to just give me the money!

247
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,410
Standing by to move in.

248
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,560
Hold on, Curtis.

249
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,670
Erwich knows who Jack is

250
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,520
he saw him at the airport. They'll kill him.

251
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,320
By the time Jack gets close enough to be recognized the TAC teams will move in.

252
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,450
No, we need to move in now,

253
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,260
take the two terrorists and make them tell us where Erwich is.

254
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,090
We don't have time.

255
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,530
Erwich will know something's wrong and we'll lose him.This is our only shot.

256
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,840
Bill?!

257
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,610
Are we letting them take Jack? I'm awaiting orders.

258
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,860
Stand down,Curtis.Take no action.

259
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,680
Reassemble the TAC teams and mount a follow operation.

260
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,530
All teams stand by.

261
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,290
Lynn's right.

262
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,060
Whatever happens, Jack can handle it.

263
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,040
He has to.

264
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,790
Come in.

265
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,030
Excuse me, Mrs. Logan.

266
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,470
What is it?

267
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,780
Laura Campbell gave me the press release to give to you.

268
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,590
I'm confused. About what?

269
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,720
It's not what you said.

270
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,860
They're calling Walt Cummings a hero,not a traitor.

271
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,810
I don't believe this!

272
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,770
Well? Is CTU any closer?

273
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,620
They're mounting an undercover operation,

274
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,510
which they hope will lead them to the canisters.

275
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,750
Hope is not good enough.

276
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,140
We want results.You need to make that abundantly clear to them, Mike!

277
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,460
I believe they're doing everything that can be done, sir.

278
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,830
I just read the statement you issued about Walt's death.

279
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,530
"Stress due to overwork robbed"

280
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,950
"this country of one of its most dedicated public servants."

281
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,260
"His work with this administration has..."

282
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,160
You're covering everything up.

283
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,290
I'll wait outside.

284
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,630
Don't go anywhere, Mike.

285
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,490
Your fingerprints are all over this.

286
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Charles, we worked on this together.

287
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,860
I thought we'd both agreed

288
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,680
that you needed to go public about Walt's involvement

289
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,490
with everything that is going on today.

290
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,960
I know. I know you're disappointed,

291
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,740
but I think it's obvious that Walt

292
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,510
taking his own life changes things.

293
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,100
What's obvious is that this is a pack of lies!

294
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,530
Mrs. Logan...

295
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,890
full disclosure would have been necessary

296
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,870
to ensure Walt faced justice for what he'd done.

297
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,100
With his death making that a non-issue,

298
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,380
it was decided this course was best for his family.

299
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,530
Oh... don't.

300
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,790
You don't care about his family.

301
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,890
You decided that this was best for you.

302
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,790
- But, Charles, you are dead wrong... - Martha, that's enough!

303
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,040
I made my decision...

304
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,900
and I am the president.

305
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,660
Which means it's your job to tell the truth...

306
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,800
even when it's ugly.

307
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,090
And if you don't, I will.

308
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,690
If you feel so strongly about telling the truth,

309
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,820
you can start with Walt's wife when she arrives.

310
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,980
Suzanne's coming here?

311
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,770
To collect her husband's body.

312
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,520
So you can be the one to tell her

313
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,690
that the real reason that Walt took the coward's way out

314
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,580
was because he disgraced himself

315
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,240
and he betrayed his country.

316
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,050
All right.

317
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,240
It'll be very painful...

318
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,370
but it's the right thing to do.

319
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,350
We're one mile behind Jack, heading west

320
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,760
on Nordhoff, just passing Sepulveda.

321
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,190
Maintain your distance.

322
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,400
We've got them on satellite.We're not going to lose them.

323
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,650
Where are we going?

324
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
What does it matter?

325
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,470
I have another appointment,I just want to know if I'm going to make it.

326
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,910
We're almost there.

327
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,930
How long it takes once we get there is up to you.

328
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,010
What do you mean?

329
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,160
I told you.

330
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,630
We need to make sure the remote trigger works on the canisters.

331
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,930
Oh, my God, you've got one of the canisters with you.

332
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,030
Erwich wants a field test.

333
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,390
I'm not going to be within 50 miles of that thing when it goes off.

334
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,440
We have masks.

335
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,640
What's the target?

336
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,740
Curtis, are you reading this?

337
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,460
Yeah. You want me to reposition the TAC team for an intercept?

338
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,960
No! Not till we have a visual on the canister.

339
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,360
If they stay on Nordhoff,

340
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,760
up ahead there's an industrial park and two retail complexes.

341
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,020
They just turned north.That's not good.

342
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,260
What is it, Chloe, what's the potential target?

343
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,780
The Sunrise Hills Mall.

344
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,560
Curtis, the intended target is the Sunrise Hills Mall.

345
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,430
Repeat the intended target is the Sunrise Hills Mall.

346
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,120
Uploading schematics of the mall,surrounding streets,to TAC teams now.

347
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,700
All right, all teams stand by for positioning.

348
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,700
We're setting up at the second level of the parking structure.

349
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,660
This is it.

350
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,700
Curtis?

351
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,180
Do you have Jack on visual?

352
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,760
Yeah. He and the two hostiles are in the south parking lot.

353
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,330
Alpha Team, take the position on the perimeter of the lot.

354
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,560
Bravo Team, I want your plainclothes agents in position at the mall doors.

355
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,390
How are you going to get the canister inside?

356
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,540
Through the front door.

357
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,340
Anyone asks,

358
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,320
we're working on the air-conditioning.

359
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,260
I didn't agree to this.I'm not going in.

360
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,790
Yes, you are.

361
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,160
Jack is trying to stall for time.

362
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,450
What are we waiting for?

363
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,520
There are hundreds of video cameras in there.

364
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,410
This entire country will know what we look like in the next few hours.

365
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,820
We want your leaders to know who did this to them.

366
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,920
This is your fight.

367
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,940
The deal I made with Erwich was to sell him the chip,

368
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,910
not to get my face all over the news.

369
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,070
Erwich prefers to keep you alive,but only if you cooperate.

370
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,150
Now, hand me the jackets.

371
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,340
Jack, we're moving the TAC teams in

372
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,940
to recover the canister before you go inside the mall.

373
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,160
Fine, let's get this over with.

374
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,960
I'll let you know as soon as we're in position.

375
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,110
Sending redeployment orders now.

376
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,250
Hold off on that.

377
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,730
What? Lynn?!

378
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,080
We have got to stop them before they get inside.

379
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,430
If we move in now Erwich will know that we're onto him,

380
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,430
and we won't be led to the other canisters.

381
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,570
Are you talking about letting them go through with this?

382
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,100
Sacrificing the lives of all those people?

383
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,790
We're talking about accepting the damage

384
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,950
that one canister can do,

385
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,880
versus what the other 19 can do.

386
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,770
This is insane.Bill?!

387
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,190
Bill's not in charge here, I am!

388
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,980
We need to call the president.

389
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,360
I just got into the mall's internal video surveillance server.

390
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,890
We should be able to see Jack.

391
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,700
Jack, we're still waiting for the president to call.

392
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,460
I'll let you know as soon as we have him.

393
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,130
Get the security guard.Knock on the glass.

394
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,960
What are you guys doing here?

395
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,620
Servicing the HVAC units.

396
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,990
We didn't get a call about that.

397
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,290
I don't know what to tell you. We did.

398
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,590
You got paperwork?

399
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,840
Just a minute.

400
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,370
Will this work?

401
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,290
Yeah.

402
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,550
Do it.

403
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,760
Throw me the bag.

404
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,800
And your jacket.

405
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,600
Mr. Buchanan, the president is on line one.

406
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,120
- Put him through. - Yes sir.

407
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,300
Jack, we have the president on the line.I'm gonna patch you in.

408
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,530
Go ahead.

409
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,040
Mr. President, this is Lynn McGill.

410
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,430
You also have Bill Buchanan Audrey Raines

411
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,830
Chloe O'Brian and Edgar Stiles in the room.

412
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,040
Go ahead.

413
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,990
Sir, we're calling you for a decision on a critical operational matter.

414
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,990
What is it?

415
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,500
Jack Bauer is currently undercover with some of the terrorists.

416
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,810
They're expecting Jack to help them release a single canister of

417
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,060
Sentox nerve gas in the Sunrise Hills Shopping Mall.

418
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,450
where they are right now.

419
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,360
Well, then arrest them. What's the problem?

420
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,470
Sir, the problem is, if we don't maintain Jack's cover,

421
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,430
there's no guarantee that they'll lead us back to the other 19 canisters.

422
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,930
Do you mean actually let them release the Sentox?

423
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,960
Are you out of your mind?!

424
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,850
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan.

425
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,660
I had the same initial reaction.

426
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,680
Then I looked at our updated scenarios.

427
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,360
With the help of other terrorist organizations,

428
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,930
the remaining 19 canisters

429
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,720
could be deployed at other, more crowded public areas, such as

430
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,870
subway stations, hospitals and sports arenas, sir.

431
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,360
The loss of life could exceed hundreds of thousands of people.

432
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,240
My God.

433
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,440
Bring it over here.

434
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,300
What kind of casualties are you predicting at the mall?

435
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,120
We don't have exact numbers, but based on our video surveillance,

436
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,630
our best guess is between eight and nine hundred.

437
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,760
Sir, many of them are children.

438
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,510
Can't you evacuate the mall?

439
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,440
Not without the terrorists knowing.

440
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,400
The public will not tolerate the government's complicity in this.

441
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,930
They wouldn't know, sir.

442
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,390
This would be a covert decision.

443
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,370
We are monitoring the terrorists.

444
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,230
We know the 100 percent cerkenty

445
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,500
we will be able to track them back to the remaining canisters.

446
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,700
What's your recommendation?

447
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,860
Bill Buchanan and I agree

448
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,580
that the greatest good would be served by allowing them

449
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,530
to release this single canister of Sentox nerve gas.

450
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,700
And I believe, sir, that we have no right

451
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,060
to sanction the deaths of innocent people.

452
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,370
We should take our chances, interrogate these men,

453
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,150
and find the location of the other canisters.

454
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,870
Are we ready?

455
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,170
Almost.

456
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,160
Mr. President, we're running out of time.

457
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,660
We need your decision, sir.

458
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,870
This is a field operation.It's up to you.

459
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,320
With all due respect, Mr. President, it's not.

460
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,230
We don't have the legal authority

461
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,600
to make this decision, only you do.

462
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,220
You're putting me in a terrible position.

463
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,460
Hold on.

464
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,060
Mike?

465
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,200
CTU has laid out the facts well.

466
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,000
But you have to make the call.

467
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,830
All right.

468
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,520
The terrorists are forcing us to make a tragic choice.

469
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,060
I'll go along with your assessment.

470
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,670
Let them release the Sentox.

471
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,640
But you better find those other canisters

472
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,810
or those people will have died in vain.

473
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,030
Pull our TAC teams out of the mall.

474
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,670
Jack, you heard the president's decision.

475
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,140
Let's go.

476
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,440
Put your masks on.

477
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,870
Go and arm the valve.

478
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,320
What's the unlock code?

479
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,240
Jack, the unlock code is alpha-kilo-charlie.

480
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,490
I repeat, alpha-kilo-charlie.

481
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,060
Come on! What's the unlock code?!

482
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,660
Alpha-kilo-charlie.

483
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,310
Echo-bravo-charlie.

484
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,490
Enter the correct code, Jack. That's an order.

485
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,450
Jack, this is a direct order from the president!

486
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,430
Now enter the correct code, let them release the gas! Now!

487
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,000
It's not arming the canister.

488
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,490
Why isn't it working?

489
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,480
Maybe the remote's been damaged.

490
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,390
Make it work or I'll kill you.

491
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,840
There's nothing I can do.

492
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,570
Make it work!

493
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,790
I told you there's nothing I can do!

494
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,410
Jack, can you hear me?

495
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,640
Yes?

496
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,060
We can't arm the canisters!

497
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,850
What is the problem?

498
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,330
Rossler says he doesn't know.

499
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,660
Do you believe him?

500
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,720
I don't know.

501
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,960
Should I kill him?

502
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,840
Not until we are sure we have another way to release the gas.

503
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,570
Andrei thinks he's discovered an alternative.

504
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,770
I'll put him on.

505
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,470
Get him in the other room.

506
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,730
Polakov.

507
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,410
What's going on?

508
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,910
Andrei thinks he may have another way to release the gas.

509
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,660
Now move the jumper over.

510
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,690
Expose the red and yellow wire.

511
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,300
Hang on, I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

512
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,860
Are you sure the valve can't open without warning?

513
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,670
If you make a mistake, it could,so pay attention.

514
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,610
Five more splices to go.

515
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,660
Get the masks. We're almost ready.

516
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,350
Lynn, there is still time to move in and stop them

517
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,220
before they murder all those people.

518
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,840
Audrey, we have a directive from the president.

519
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,590
The president's not looking at these children

520
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,350
whose death warrant he just signed.

521
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,870
Don't you realize how many more people could die

522
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,940
if these men don't lead us to the other 19 canisters?

523
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,910
They could.

524
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,040
That's theoretical right now.

525
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,120
Those children will die within minutes! Look at them.

526
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,680
- Look at the monitors! - Audrey, that's enough.

527
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,790
No, it's not. Lynn, you tell me, if you were in Jack's shoes

528
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
could you follow through with that order,

529
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,750
stand by and watch as they murder all those people?

530
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,970
This is war. There are going to be casualties.

531
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,440
And if those are orders of the president, yes!

532
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,080
I would have to.

533
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,720
I hope that's not true.

534
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,000
For your sake.

535
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,130
All right, the wires are together.

536
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,430
Put your mask on.

537
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,550
Next pair you splice will open the valve.

538
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,180
Go kill Rossler.

539
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,350
Polakov.

540
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,110
Jack, can you hear me?

541
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,780
What's happening, Jack? What's your status?

542
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,420
I've managed to stop the flow of gas,

543
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,930
but some got into the air system.

544
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,050
We need to evacuate the mall, now.

545
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,320
What about the terrorists?

546
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,270
One's dead, one escaped.

547
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,230
Have Curtis and his men start looking for them.

548
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,400
Curtis, this is Buchanan.Move in, now.

549
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,880
About time. Move in!

550
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,910
Move in! All teams, move in!

551
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,720
You,walk against the wall.

552
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,150
I'm a federal agent.

553
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,860
Terrorists have released a toxic substance into the air system.

554
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,710
You need to evacuate people now.

555
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,750
This is not a joke.This is not a robbery or a drill.

556
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,900
do it now!

557
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,180
Uh, we have a red alert.

558
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,580
Begin evacuation procedures immediately!

559
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,290
Where is the power source for the air system?

560
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,720
It's next to the food court.The control room door's right there.

561
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,300
Curtis, do you copy?

562
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,720
Yeah, Jack, we're closing in on the mall.

563
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,480
I'm going to try and shut down the air system in the mall.

564
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,830
I do not have a visual on the hostile.

565
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,730
Make sure your men take him alive.

566
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
Understood.

567
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,120
Curtis, it's Jack.

568
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,750
The Sentox that escaped has managed to stay in the food court.

569
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,780
We've got at least 11 people down.

570
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,180
I need assistance. I need assistance now!

571
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,580
Got it.

572
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,880
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

573
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,750
I want you to hold the mask.when I take it off, okay?

574
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,460
All right, everyone, masks on.

575
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,580
Inject anyone who's down.Get them outside as soon as possible.

576
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,780
I need a shot of atropine for a child under 12!

577
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,540
Curtis, give me that jacket for her head.

578
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,510
I'm losing her!

579
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,910
Come on.

580
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,720
She's responding.Her pulse is stabilizing.

581
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,610
Jack, we've secured the exits.

582
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,740
We don't have a visual on the other terrorist.

583
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,780
If he got out of the mall before we locked down

584
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,020
he may be lost.

585
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,660
And our only remaining chance of finding Erwich.

586
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,970
Monitor the tracking device in the remote trigger.

587
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,270
The hostile that escaped still had it on him.

588
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,300
Chloe.

589
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,030
Jack's right

590
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,010
the signal's moving away from the mall

591
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,530
looks like he's on foot.

592
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,400
Michaels.

593
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,040
Jack and I are going after the remote trigger.

594
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,080
You're in charge here. Report directly to Bill Buchanan.

595
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,670
Yes sir.

596
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,080
Walsh, gather your team. You're with us.

597
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,490
Don't be scared.

598
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,820
You're gonna be all right.

599
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,710
This man's going to take care of you.

600
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,680
- Yes. - Rossler

601
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,000
or whoever he was

602
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,170
killed Komar and tried to stop us.

603
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,470
What are you talking about? Why?

604
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,670
I don't know!

605
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,230
I managed to activate the valve before I got away.

606
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,230
At least some of the gas was released in the mall.

607
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,700
You sure you're not being followed?

608
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,590
Yes.

609
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,830
What do you want me to do?

610
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,090
Come back here.

611
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,190
I'll be there soon.

612
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,270
He's turning left on Reese.

613
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,880
We're six blocks out.

614
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,800
One moment please Mr. McGill.

615
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,410
I'll connect you with the President.

616
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:28,870
Yes.

617
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,390
Mr. President, I know this is not what your order stipulated.

618
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,480
That's why I thought it was important to let you know what was happening.

619
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,600
What's happening is I sent you over there

620
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,730
to make sure CTU was running smoothly

621
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,910
in a time of crisis,

622
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,030
and you seem to be incapable doing that.

623
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,960
Sir, Bauer refused the order.There was nothing I could do.

624
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,600
No. I don't want excuses.Just do your job.

625
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,990
And if you can't do it, I'll find somebody else who can.

626
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,760
The estimates from the mall are much lower than we originally anticipated.

627
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,160
It appears the fatalities will be limited to between ten and 20 people.

628
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,330
Thank God.

629
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,310
So,

630
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,420
what are we telling the media?

631
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,480
Nothing yet.

632
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,960
CTU is maintaining a blackout on the ground there

633
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,090
until we give them direction on a cover story.

634
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,930
What about the other 19 canisters?

635
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,270
CTU has a terrorist

636
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,190
under surveillance as we speak.

637
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,630
They believe there's a good chance

638
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,420
he'll lead them to Erwich and the rest of the canisters.

639
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,430
All right, good.

640
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,460
There's something else, sir.

641
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,330
Suzanne Cummings has arrived to claim Walt's body.

642
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,220
Martha is on her way to speak with her now.

643
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,860
Thank you, Mike.

644
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,530
Suzanne.

645
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,560
Hi, honey.

646
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,190
I can't believe he's gone.

647
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,120
I'm sorry.

648
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,660
I'm so, so sorry.

649
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,130
I should have been with him today.

650
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,660
I wanted to be.

651
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,610
Honey, don't, don't do that.Don't blame yourself.

652
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,640
He told me to ...

653
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,090
You know how much we love you, honey.

654
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,360
And no matter what you need,we'll always be here for you.

655
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,520
I just don't understand. This doesn't make any sense.

656
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,030
You were with him today.

657
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,730
Why, Martha, why in the world

658
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,120
would... Walt do this?

659
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,400
Suzanne...

660
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,050
Walt...

661
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,360
loved this country.

662
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:25,570
And he loved you.

663
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,930
I'm sorry.

664
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,290
I think I need a moment.

665
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,560
Of course.All right.

666
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,530
He's slowing down.

667
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,730
He's stopping.Cross-referencing with the street grid.

668
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,760
He's in front of 1136 East Muldauer.

669
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,390
Bill, we're going to have to hit him hard and fast,

670
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,660
to try and stop him from releasing any more Sentox from the canisters.

671
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Agreed.

672
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,620
Set up a perimeter

673
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,690
and begin your approach.

674
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,480
All right, teams, we're moving in.

675
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,510
Put your gas masks on.

676
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,320
Team B, take the front entrance off the street.

677
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,760
We're taking the side. Go now. Go.

678
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,070
Yes.

679
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,240
- You were followed. -I don't know how.

680
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,430
It doesn't matter.

681
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,160
You know what to do.

682
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,490
Yes.

683
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,540
No!

684
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,670
Hostile down! I repeat!

685
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,280
Hostile down!

686
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,290
Here is clean!

687
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,690
Curtis, have your men call in now.

688
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,070
Team A, Team B, report.

689
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,280
Come on, guys. What do you got?

690
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,830
Place is empty.

691
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,790
Erwich is gone. The canisters are gone.We've got nothing here!

692
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,660
Damn it!
