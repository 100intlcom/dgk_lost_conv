1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,730
What we're doing here is very simple.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,320
We're going to release a certain substance

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,580
so that it flows into your pipelines.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,510
Take the canisters to the main distribution tank quickly.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,110
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,070
No.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,130
Explain.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,170
We rolled his car, but he survived and got away.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,210
It was sloppy work, we'll make it right.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,120
Well,you damn well better. You know what's at stake.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,240
Get down!

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,290
It's the truth. Audrey Raines was my contact

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,080
at the Department of Defense.

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,220
-You met with her face-to-face? -Yes.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,810
Damn it,Audrey!Tell me the truth!

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,460
I am telling you the truth.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,450
You already lied to me once.

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,760
You tell me what you know

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,910
or I promise you this will become very unpleasant.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,250
Bill,we have a connection

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,830
between Collette Stenger and Henderson.

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,680
She received eight calls from him she didn't tell us about.

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,300
That voids her agreement, it's off.

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,220
You have three seconds to tell me

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,840
where the targets or I will kill you.

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,160
Where is the target?!

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,200
A natural gas distribution center.

28
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,190
Our analysts tell us

29
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,030
once the Sentox hits the main tank,

30
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,050
it goes right into the pipes

31
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,750
where it becomes impossible to stop.

32
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,560
From there,it goes straight into people's homes.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,590
Sentox is already in the system.

34
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,990
Give me the C-4 and a timer, then get these people out of here.

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,370
Jack,what are you doing?

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,960
In order to deliver the Sentox,

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,570
it had to mix with natural gas.

38
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,440
If we can ignite that gas before it leaves the plant,

39
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,270
the Sentox will be incinerated.

40
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,770
Bierko!

41
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,280
Jack,that's it, the main tanks are going.

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,110
Get out!

43
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,400
Jack,are you here?

44
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,780
Jack,respond.

45
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,560
The follwing takes place between 10Pm and 11Pm

46
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,290
Curtis,Curtis,this is Audrey.

47
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,750
Any sign of Jack?

48
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,980
Nothing so far.

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,960
I've got men searching the main tank area.

50
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,700
Fire and rescue units just arrived.

51
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,130
They're assessing the situation now.

52
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,340
Chloe,what are we getting from the air monitors?

53
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,390
Come on,Jack.

54
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,740
Chloe.

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,560
Just minimal trace readings of the nerve agent.

56
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
Well below danger levels.

57
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,060
It looks like the Sentox was incinerated in the blast.

58
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,820
Jack's plan worked.

59
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm going to briefthe White House. Apprise me of any developments.

60
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,700
Miles.

61
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,940
Curtis,have we done a full search of the area for Jack?

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,400
It's underway.

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,210
We know he hasn't gone out the north exit.

64
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,420
CTU,Jack's okay.

65
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,800
Get a medical team over here now!

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,040
Jack!

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,040
you okay?

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,820
Give me a hand.

69
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,390
I got it.

70
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,260
Bierko!

71
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,940
Bierko!

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,220
Bierko!

73
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,450
I need him conscious.

74
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,330
Yes,sir.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,320
The nerve gas,did it leave the plant?

76
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,160
There's no trace of it. Explosion worked.

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,930
Good.

78
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,650
He's going into severe shock. We need to transport him now.

79
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,490
I want him taken back to CTU Medical.

80
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,270
Yes,sir.

81
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,670
Curtis,organize an escort team.

82
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,170
You get him back to CTU alive.

83
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,680
You got it.

84
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,250
On my count.Three,two,one. Let's go.

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,920
Buchanan.

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,940
Bill,it's Jack.

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,300
Is your line still secure?

88
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:09,990
Yes.

89
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,650
What's your status on Henderson?

90
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,070
Henderson's still an active protocol.

91
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,860
You need to make him a priority.

92
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,230
Bill,listen to me.

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,950
I know Henderson.

94
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,810
He couldn't have planned this.

95
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,750
He's a soldier and a patriot.

96
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,210
However misguided,he believes what he's doing right now

97
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,720
is right for this country.

98
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,460
He was willing to let his wife die in order

99
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,290
to protect someone, someone very powerful.

100
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,520
Who?

101
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,300
I don't know.

102
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,730
Bill,I'm scared.

103
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,970
I think this is bigger than anything

104
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,550
we could ever have imagined.

105
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,480
Karen,you're not hearing me.

106
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,190
They managed to prevent an attack,

107
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,810
but that doesn't negate the fact that CTU's performance

108
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,460
has been comprised of one misstep after another.

109
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,590
I'm not disputing that, Mr. Vice President.

110
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,930
Then why the hesitation to carry out your mandate

111
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,020
and have Homeland absorb CTU?

112
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,690
CTU is still actively

113
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,470
looking for Christopher Henderson.

114
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,560
A shakeup right now could hamper that search.

115
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,990
I'm not going to hold up this takeover

116
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,670
because of a procedural mop up.

117
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,090
Henderson will be caught, you can be sure of that.

118
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,100
-Is that understood? -Clearly.

119
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,390
Whatever bureaucratic hoops you have to jump through,that's your business.

120
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,640
Just get it done.

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,090
-Yes,sir. -And keep me informed.

122
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,010
I guess we should get started.

123
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,830
Buchanan is not going to take this lying down.

124
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,030
Despite what the vice president said,

125
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,090
CTU just saved a lot of lives.

126
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,670
If Buchanan mounts a challenge, it will be seen in that light.

127
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,670
This action could be easily reversed.

128
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,130
If we were to find someone who would go on record

129
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,190
citing Buchanan's mismanagement,

130
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,580
how he superseded Lynn McGill's authority,

131
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,780
how he allowed CTU to be compromised...

132
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,310
go a long way to mitigating his successes,

133
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,200
give us the protection we need.

134
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,860
Buchanan's people are extremely loyal.

135
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm not thinking about a member of CTU.

136
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,540
I'm thinking of Audrey Raines.

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,350
She was here all morning,

138
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,670
she saw what went on.

139
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,750
And her loyalty is split between CTU and DOD.

140
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,710
We could take advantage of that.

141
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,900
Let me draft a statement and present it to her.

142
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,400
We're being rolled up,Audrey.

143
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,350
Homeland's taking over.

144
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,930
That's impossible.

145
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,740
Karen told me herself.

146
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,950
No,they can't do that,not after what you've accomplished today.

147
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,130
I'd like to think we've earned a reprieve,but I doubt it.

148
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,940
CTU is in the middle of an investigation.

149
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,630
Henderson is still at large.

150
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,780
I know,it doesn't make any sense.

151
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,500
Karen's taking orders from Vice President Gardner.

152
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,870
He wants this to happen.

153
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,400
Why?

154
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,900
I've been asking myself the same question.

155
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,540
-Yeah. -We lost him.

156
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,980
Well,how in the hell did you lose him?

157
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,450
Palmer knocked Cobb out and retrieved his weapon.

158
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,420
We tried to pursue,but someone came to Palmer's aid.

159
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,600
Who?

160
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,990
That's unclear.

161
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,770
They got away.

162
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,740
All right.

163
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,690
We're going to a fallback,scrub the scene and get over here.

164
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,810
Yes,sir.

165
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,470
You're all right, Mr. Palmer.

166
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,980
Just take it slow.

167
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,450
Aaron?

168
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,580
We're at the presidential retreat.

169
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,440
Can you try to sit up?

170
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,230
I think we neeto get you looked at,sir.

171
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,970
No,no,Aaron,there's not enough time for that.

172
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,930
I'm all right.

173
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,280
Then maybe you can explain to me what's going on.

174
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,820
Why were those men trying to kill you?

175
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,630
Because David had a source inside the White House

176
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,420
and someone is trying to prevent me from seeing her.

177
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,650
Who is this source?

178
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,050
Mrs. Logan's assistant.

179
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,680
Evelyn Martin?

180
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:14,930
Yeah.

181
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,100
Yeah,she and David were trading e-mails.

182
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,160
Listen,Aaron,

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,990
I need to find out the content of those messages.

184
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,310
I think David was killed because of information Evelyn gave him.

185
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,190
Mrs. Logan,

186
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,900
I drafted a letter to the families of the victims

187
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,190
at the Sunrise Hills Mall. It's here for your review.

188
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,190
Thank you.

189
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,690
And your schedule's there as well.

190
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,240
You have a 9:00 a. m. with the press office

191
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,340
and the president wants you in on his morning briefing.

192
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,610
Evelyn...

193
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,100
you all right?

194
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,190
I'm fine. Just tired.

195
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,100
It's been a long day.

196
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,140
I'm surprised any of us got through it.

197
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,220
Oh,do you have your credentials with you?

198
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,910
There's still a curfew in place.

199
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,680
I have them with me.

200
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,200
Good.Try to get some rest.

201
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,600
-Good night. -Good night.

202
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,100
Evelyn.

203
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,970
Hi.

204
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,580
I really need to talk to you.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,890
I'm sorry,Mr. Palmer, I need to go home.

206
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,790
Ma'am.

207
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,640
Please.

208
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,540
This won't take but a second.

209
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,590
You were sending e-mails to my brother,Evelyn.

210
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,840
Why?

211
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,880
Mr. Palmer,I don't know what you're talking about.

212
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,150
I traced the IP account.

213
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,470
I traced it right to your address,

214
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,340
so,yes,you do know what I'm talking about.

215
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,400
I need to know what you told David.

216
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,680
I didn't tell him anything.

217
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,640
Evelyn,

218
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,150
I have the record of your correspondence.

219
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
David deleted the content on the messages,

220
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,890
but I know,Evelyn,

221
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,670
I know you were in contact with him,

222
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,370
so please don't lie to me again.

223
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
Tell me what I need to know.

224
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,920
Someone killed David

225
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,340
they killed him and they just tried to kill me.

226
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,290
Now,I think they knew I was coming here to see you.

227
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,100
So I think that means we're both in danger,don't you?

228
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,200
Please,I have to go now.

229
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,580
Tell me what I need!

230
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,180
Talk to me!

231
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,230
I can't.

232
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,030
They kidnapped my little girl.

233
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,530
They kidnapped my little girl.

234
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,970
They said they would give Amy back to me

235
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,610
if I gave them the evidence.

236
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,740
What evidence?

237
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
I have proof about who is behind everything

238
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,820
that's happened today.

239
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,490
They're going to kill my baby.

240
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,930
-Evelyn,okay... -They're going to kill...

241
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,390
Listen to me, all right? Listen.

242
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,110
Even if you turn over this evidence,

243
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,250
they're not just going to give you back your daughter

244
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,410
and let you go.That's not what these people do

245
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,160
Now,you've got to trust me,Evelyn.

246
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,750
Please,talk to me.

247
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,540
If I may?

248
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,080
Mr. Palmer's right.

249
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,200
You know too much.

250
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,360
They'll kill you both.

251
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,130
I'll give you the evidence that I have

252
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,860
if you get me back my daughter.

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,590
I pulled up Henderson's work records for the past ten years.

254
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
It's a lot of material.

255
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,480
I'll start data-mining, see if there's anything

256
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,810
we can use to track him down.

257
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
That's Chloe O'Brian.

258
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,110
That's Jim Hill, from Homeland.

259
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,070
I'm Jim Hill, Homeland Security.

260
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,370
Could you show me your station.

261
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,880
Chloe O'Brian?

262
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,020
Yeah?

263
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,320
I'm taking over your station.

264
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,070
I'll need all your relevant access codes.

265
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,040
Who are you? What's going on here?

266
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,200
May I have your attention,please?

267
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,260
These men and women are from Homeland Security.

268
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,570
I've just authorized a unit-wide backslash protocol.

269
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,500
CTU is being absorbed

270
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,810
by the Department of Homeland Security.

271
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,520
Ladies and gentlemen, I realize this is sudden,

272
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,320
and this has been a very difficult day,

273
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,700
but let's all cooperate

274
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,300
to make this transition as smooth as possible.

275
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,170
There is still work to be done.

276
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,590
Vladimir Bierko is en route to CTU,

277
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,510
and Christopher Henderson remains anpen protocol.

278
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,450
Thank you.

279
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,330
Ms. Raines,

280
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,760
would you mind joining me in the Situation Room?

281
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,210
Why?

282
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,320
We need to speak in private.

283
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,690
Fine.

284
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,600
-This is Bauer. -Jack,it's Wayne Palmer.

285
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,570
Wayne.

286
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,570
Are you all right?

287
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,450
I just heard about that explosion at the gas plant.

288
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,770
Yeah,I'm fine.

289
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,910
Listen,Wayne, I wish I could tell you

290
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,230
that all the people that were responsible

291
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,780
for your brother's assassination are in custody,but I can't.

292
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,850
Yeah,Well,maybe I can help you with that.

293
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,360
How?

294
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,090
Jack,I'm at President Logan's retreat.

295
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm here with Evelyn Martin, Mrs. Logan's personal assistant.

296
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,500
What does Evelyn Martin have to do with this?

297
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,370
She says she has proof there were other people involved

298
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,880
in the plot to kill my brother.

299
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,110
And I believe her.

300
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,920
Who?

301
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,220
She won't tell me.

302
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,360
Why not?

303
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,990
Her eight-year-old daughter's been kidnapped.

304
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,740
They're going to kill her

305
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,600
unless Evelyn hands over the evidence.

306
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,120
This has to be Henderson.

307
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,990
They're supposed to call any minute with a place to meet.

308
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,200
Okay. I want to be on that call when it comes in.

309
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,190
CTU will provide operational support.

310
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,950
We're going to need a place to meet.

311
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,410
I passed an old barn about a mile west of the retreat off Service Road 19.

312
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,110
Service Road 19.

313
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,620
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

314
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,640
See you then.

315
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,990
Jack's going to meet us. We should go.

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,660
Evelyn,listen. They may be watching you,

317
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,770
so I don't think we should leave together.

318
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,730
What do you want to do?

319
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,340
We'll separate.

320
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,260
Get to your car,and we'll meet up in the parking lot.

321
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,260
I'll see you soon.

322
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,090
"... the acting director's failure

323
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,580
"to enhance security measures, especially in the light

324
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,230
"of the heightened threat,effectively

325
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,600
"invited the subsequent attack

326
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,250
that resulted in loss of personnel. "

327
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,550
You can't possibly expect me to sign this.

328
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,890
It's a complete distortion of today's event

329
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,450
designed to place blame on Bill Buchanan and CTU.

330
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,130
But you would agree that today's attacks

331
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,490
represent a serious intelligence failure

332
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,050
that needs to be addressed.

333
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,290
Thanks to CTU,

334
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,830
hundreds of thousands of people are alive

335
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,340
who would otherwise be dead.

336
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,950
But,if CTU had been operating effectively,

337
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,930
those people would never have been at risk.

338
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,430
I couldn't more strongly disagree with this statement.

339
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,840
Well,I'm disappointed with your decision,

340
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,400
but I appreciate your loyalty.

341
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,910
Of course.

342
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,080
Oh,just to confirm.

343
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,530
As on-site liaison for DOD,

344
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,670
you participated in today's decision-making process.

345
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,840
What's your point?

346
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,800
Serious mistakes were made here today

347
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,660
that resulted in the loss of American lives.

348
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,010
It would be a shame to see the taint

349
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,790
of CTU's mismanagement

350
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,100
spread to your agency...

351
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,790
and your career.

352
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,950
By signing this,

353
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,080
you isolate the fallout for today's mistakes

354
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,790
to Bill Buchanan and CTU...

355
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,530
where it belongs.

356
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I'm proud

357
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,830
of what we did here today.

358
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,890
The people of CTU are heroes,

359
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,240
especially Bill Buchanan.

360
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,410
This takeover is completely unwarranted,

361
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,430
and I won't help you justify it.

362
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,790
Hello.

363
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,390
-Audrey,it's Jack. -Jack,where are you?

364
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,220
I'm on my way to see Wayne Palmer.

365
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,300
Wayne Palmer?

366
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,540
Wayne just told me that Evelyn Martin,

367
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,940
Senior Aide to the First Lady has evidence that would prove

368
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,270
who was really behind David Palmer's assassination,

369
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,040
but she won't give the evidence to Wayne

370
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,380
because her daughter's been kidnapped

371
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,110
in an effort to try and keep her quiet.

372
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,290
I think Henderson's behind this.

373
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,610
They want to make a trade:

374
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,140
the evidence for the girl.

375
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,390
My God,Jack.

376
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,300
Yeah,I'm going to need you to retask a satellite

377
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,150
to those coordinates-I'll have them in a few minutes.

378
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,730
Jack,that could be difficult right now.

379
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,500
Why?

380
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,020
CTU is being rolled up.

381
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,550
Karen Hayes is replacing everyone

382
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,240
with people from Homeland.

383
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,100
What are you talking about? That doesn't make sense.

384
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,880
I know.

385
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,760
Even if she has a reason to,we're in the middle

386
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,220
of tracking down Christopher Henderson.

387
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,170
We'll never be able to bring her team up to speed.

388
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,180
I know she's taking orders from Vice President Gardner himself.

389
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,790
Gardner.

390
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,700
Jack,maybe you should talk to Karen directly.

391
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,600
No.

392
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,110
She's the one in control here.

393
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,670
When I was interrogating Henderson,

394
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,290
it was obvious that he was protecting someone,

395
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,670
someone very powerful.

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,260
He was willing to let his wife die

397
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,610
rather than give him up.

398
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,660
and now,all of a sudden, Vice President Gardner

399
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,430
is shutting down CTU when we're actually

400
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,060
in a position to bring Henderson in?

401
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,990
Do you really think that Gardner's involved with this?

402
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,100
We can't afford to take the chance that he's not.

403
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,110
All right, what do you want me to do?

404
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,730
I want you to get Chloe to retask the satellite.

405
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,290
I'll get the coordinates over to you.

406
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,860
Jack,Chloe has been let go,

407
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,570
along with the rest of her department.

408
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,030
Audrey,I need the satellite.

409
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,120
Just figure out a way to get Chloe back on.

410
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,940
All right,all right, I'll call you back.

411
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,530
I could approach some of the senior CTU staffers.

412
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,090
I told you, that's a waste of time.

413
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,380
They're worried about their jobs.

414
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,100
We could promise them some security.

415
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,640
Excuse me.

416
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,620
I've reconsidered my posion.

417
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,770
I'll sign your statement.

418
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,660
May I ask why the sudden change of heart?

419
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,070
I don't necessarily agree with everything

420
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,410
that is in the statement, but I do see

421
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,310
the need to shield DOD of any possible controversy

422
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,410
that could reflect back on my father.

423
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,260
Miles.

424
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,490
Thank you.

425
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,430
I want one thing in return.

426
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,700
What's that?

427
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,430
That Chloe be kept on and assigned to me.

428
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,890
Why Chloe?

429
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,300
I'm going to need considerable

430
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,670
server access to compile my report for DOD.

431
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,670
Chloe can help me finish it in half the time.

432
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,700
There are other people who can do that job.

433
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,030
I have a working relationship with Chloe.

434
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,480
She's an asset that you cannot afford to lose.

435
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,090
Do we have a deal?

436
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,810
Yes.

437
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,220
Good.

438
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,360
All right.

439
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,020
Evelyn Martin will be leaving the presidential retreat in a couple of minutes.

440
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,740
It's time to get going.

441
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,520
What about the girl?

442
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,420
I'll take care of her.

443
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,420
Wayne Palmer.

444
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,520
I'm at my car.

445
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,520
No one's around.

446
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,420
-We're on our way. -Okay.

447
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,120
I'm extremely uncomfortable sending the two of you off without protection.

448
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,520
Aaron, we've been over this.

449
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
If you leave the compound again,

450
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,320
we're going to risk raising suspicion.

451
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,520
I know it, sir,

452
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
but I don't like it.

453
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,720
Wayne.

454
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,220
Well, this is a surprise.

455
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,320
We didn't know you were coming.

456
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,620
Are you here to see the president?

457
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,120
No.

458
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,520
Mr. Palmer came here to give me a memento from his brother.

459
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,920
It's a service medal.

460
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,420
Sorry, I just...

461
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,920
I knew you and the president were going to be dealing with this crisis today,

462
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,620
and I just...

463
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,320
I don't want you people to feel obliged to see me.

464
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,320
There would never, ever be any obligation on our part, Wayne,

465
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,720
especially under the circumstances.

466
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,820
I just want you to know how sorry I am.

467
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,820
Your brother was one of the greatest men to ever occupy the office.

468
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
And his loss,

469
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,420
to all of us,

470
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,820
can't be expressed in words.

471
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,920
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

472
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,520
And I know that

473
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,820
the president would also like to express his condolences to you personally.

474
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,620
That means a lot, sir,

475
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,620
but unfortunately I have a plane to catch.

476
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm, uh...

477
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,420
flying David's body back to Washington, so...

478
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,920
Oh, I understand.

479
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Safe trip.

480
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,420
Thank you, sir.

481
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,320
I'll walk you out, sir.

482
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,120
Excuse me.

483
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,020
Mr. Buchan.

484
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,220
Miss O'Brian,we're not done here.

485
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,920
How can they get away with this?

486
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,620
Chloe, this is not over.

487
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,320
Just follow your instructions.

488
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,320
Oh, it sure seems over.

489
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,320
Everyone's getting fired.

490
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,920
I'm going to do everything I can to get that order rescinded.

491
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,620
Once the details of what we accomplished here today are made public,

492
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm confident we'll be back at our posts.

493
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
The best thing you can do is stay focused

494
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,620
and follow your orders,

495
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,420
do you understand me?

496
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,120
Yes, sir.

497
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,220
It's going to be all right.

498
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,720
O'Brian, don't transfer your station to Valerie.

499
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,020
You got a pass.

500
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,720
I did?

501
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,620
Yeah. So get back to work.

502
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,420
I don't understand.

503
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,220
Why am I staying and everybody else is being let go?

504
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,620
Because Miss Raines requested that you keep your position.

505
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,120
What has Audrey Raines have to do with this?

506
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,470
Miss Raines signed a detailed statement

507
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,020
documenting the numerous missteps made today by CTU.

508
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,620
And by you in particular.

509
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,520
So, for the moment,

510
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
she gets what she wants,

511
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
and she wants O'Brian.

512
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,120
Audrey would never sign anything like that.

513
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,920
I did sign it, Bill.

514
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,020
Why?

515
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Because it's the truth.

516
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,420
You realize this effectively kills any chance we have of rescinding that order.

517
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,620
Yes, I know.

518
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm sorry.

519
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,220
O' Brian.

520
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,420
I got a call from a man about an hour ago

521
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,920
who told me that he had my daughter.

522
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,520
That if I wanted to see her alive again,

523
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,620
that I would have to follow his exact instructions.

524
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,020
Did he give you proof he had her?

525
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,720
I talked to her.

526
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,220
She sounded so scared.

527
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,520
You told anybody else about this?

528
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,020
I couldn't.

529
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,720
He said that if I did, he would know.

530
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,620
Evelyn, listen,

531
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
I know we have a deal.

532
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,920
And I'm going to do everything I can to get your daughter back.

533
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,520
No, I told you before.

534
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,320
I can't tell you anything until I have Amy back.

535
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,620
You called David with this information.

536
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,320
Why him?

537
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,620
I knew him.

538
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
He and the First Lady were friends.

539
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,620
He was truly a wonderful man.

540
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,420
Yes.

541
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,220
Yes, he was.

542
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,820
I still can't accept talking about him in the past tense.

543
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,520
I just...

544
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,220
I just can't believe he's gone.

545
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,820
I told him this information because I trusted him.

546
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,320
I never thought for a moment that it would endanger him.

547
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,520
I have your brother's blood on my hands,

548
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,420
and for that,I will never forgive myself.

549
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,720
Evelyn, you did nothing wrong.

550
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,620
It's them.

551
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,120
Bauer.

552
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,420
Jack, the call's coming through.

553
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,120
Patch me in.

554
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,320
You're ready for this?

555
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,320
Hello.

556
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,720
What took you so long to answer, Evelyn?

557
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,520
I was just passing through security.

558
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,720
I just left the retreat.

559
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,820
Are you alone?

560
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,120
Yes.

561
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,420
Why was Wayne Palmer at the retreat?

562
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,920
Wayne Palmer?

563
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,320
Please don't waste my time.

564
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,620
He was there for a reason,

565
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,120
and it wasn't to drop off his resume.

566
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,620
I think he was there to speak with you.

567
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,120
I didn't even know he was there.

568
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,320
I don't believe you.

569
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,020
I didn't see him.

570
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,620
Evelyn, if you're lying to me,

571
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,420
it's your daughter who will suffer.

572
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,920
I'm telling you the truth.

573
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,520
Please, you have to believe me.

574
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,820
Did you bring what we discussed?

575
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,720
Yes.

576
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,220
Please, let me talk to Amy.

577
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,520
Very well.

578
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,720
All rit, sweetheart,

579
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,620
this is your mommy.

580
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,520
Say hello.

581
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,520
-Mommy? -It's me, honey.

582
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,420
Are you okay?

583
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,520
Uh-huh. Are you coming to get me now?

584
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,420
Mommy's going to be there real soon.

585
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,820
I want you to keep being brave.

586
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,620
Okay?

587
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,920
Promise me?

588
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I promise.

589
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,520
I love you, my baby.

590
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
I love you, too.

591
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,020
Okay, that's enough, sweetheart.

592
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,120
Very good.

593
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,620
Now take down this address.

594
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,820
4615 Tarpin Street.

595
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,120
Got it?

596
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,320
Yes, I've got it.

597
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,520
-Hello? -Audrey, it's Jack.

598
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,820
I just got off the call.

599
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,120
It was Henderson.

600
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,420
Have you got Chloe back on line?

601
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,920
-Audrey? -Sorry, Jack.

602
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,120
Yes, Chloe's still here.

603
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,920
Okay, I'm going to give the address for the satellite sweep.

604
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,920
All right, go ahead.

605
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,020
4615 Tarpin.

606
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,220
All right.

607
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,320
Give me a few minutes.

608
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,520
Chloe, I need you to come with me.

609
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,720
Don't talk to me.

610
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,520
It's for Jack.

611
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,520
Jack?

612
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Chloe, Jack needs your help.

613
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,620
Please.

614
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,220
Fine.

615
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,020
What the hell's going on?

616
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,220
I had to keep Karen from replacing you.

617
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,520
That's why I signed the document.

618
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,620
I didn't have a choice.

619
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
I don't understand.

620
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,320
Chloe, you're the only one that Jack and I trust here.

621
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,920
Jack needs one of the satellites retasked.

622
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,120
Why?

623
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,220
Here's the address.

624
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
We need a full infrared sweep.

625
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm going to need an explanation.

626
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,420
Chloe, I promise you,

627
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,020
I will give you one,

628
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,320
but right now we need to hurry.

629
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,600
Something's wrong.

630
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
-Wayne. -Jack.

631
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,700
-You all right? -Yeah.

632
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,000
It's good to see you.

633
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,200
Good to see you, too.

634
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,300
Evelyn,

635
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,500
my name is Jack Bauer.

636
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:49,900
I promise you,

637
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,400
we're going to get your daughter back.

638
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,400
Right now I need to know what you know.

639
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,000
I already told them

640
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,700
I wouldn't give up any information

641
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,000
until I have my daughter.

642
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,580
Fine.

643
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,550
Excuse me for one second.

644
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,650
-Audrey Rains. -It's Jack. Let me speak to Chloe.

645
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,940
Okay,Jack,hold on.

646
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,470
Jack,you're on speaker.

647
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,190
Jack,Audrey told me what's happening.

648
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,330
I can't believe the vice president's involved in this.

649
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,510
Yeah,I know.

650
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,290
Where are we with the satellite?

651
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,900
It's coming up now.

652
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,550
I'm sending the image to your PDA.

653
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,170
There are men all over the place.

654
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,550
How many?

655
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,340
I'm counting ten.

656
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,220
Okay. I want you to keep the satellite on target.

657
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,900
I want you to download real-time images to my PDA.

658
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,480
Okay.

659
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,900
Jack.

660
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,040
I'm going to go with Evelyn in her car to make the exchange.

661
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,460
I want you to find somewhere safe,and I want you to stay there

662
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,010
-until this is over. -No,I'm going with you.

663
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,240
I can't allow that.This is going to be extremely dangerous.

664
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,320
I was a Marine,Jack.

665
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,760
I know that,Wayne.

666
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,360
And you never saw a combat.

667
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,280
There's a big difference between training to kill someone

668
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,780
and actually having to do it.

669
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,780
I can't put you in harm's way out of respect to your brother.

670
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,160
Your family needs you now.

671
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,440
These are the people who killed my brother,Jack.

672
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,600
They shot a bullet right through his neck,

673
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,230
and then he died in my arms.

674
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,460
Put yourself in my position.

675
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,860
Could you just walk away?

676
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,350
No.

677
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,980
Neither can I.

678
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,640
I'm coming with you,Jack.

679
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,380
Thank you for your support, Mr. Prime Minister.

680
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,350
Give my regards to your lovely wife.

681
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,210
We'll talk soon.

682
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,070
It's going to take me better part of the day to return all these phone calls.

683
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,740
That's wonderful, Mr. President.

684
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,620
World leaders, prominent Americans.

685
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,130
They're all lining up to offer their congratulations.

686
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,830
Uh,sir,were you aware that Wayne Palmer was on the premises?

687
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,180
He was?

688
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,250
Yes,I just spoke with him,

689
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,300
not a half hour ago, he just left.

690
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,600
You didn't speak with him?

691
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,060
No.

692
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,270
What was he doing here?

693
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,200
Well,he said he had a memento from President Palmer

694
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,020
he wanted to give to Aaron Pierce.It was Na service medal.

695
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,430
That explains it.

696
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,520
David and Aaron were very close.

697
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,190
I'm just surprised he didn't want to speak with you.

698
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,270
Well,it's no secret that his brother and I

699
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,470
had our share of disagreements over the years.

700
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,930
It's possible Wayne harbors ill feelings towards me.

701
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,140
That must be the reason.

702
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,620
You clear on the plan?

703
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,520
I don't think I can do this.

704
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,410
Evelyn,do you want to see your little girl again?

705
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,790
Because these men didn't hesitate

706
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,710
to kill President Palmer and they're gonna hesitate

707
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,760
to kill you and your daughter once they get what they want.

708
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,540
Right now,I am your last chance.

709
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,940
We have to stick to the plan, do you understand me?

710
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,960
Okay,once you have your daughter in your arms...

711
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,410
I know what to do.

712
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,400
We are going to get her back.

713
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,250
Let's go.

714
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,050
Call out testing-one,two,three.

715
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,350
Testing, one,two,three.

716
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,140
Chloe,did you get that?

717
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,840
You're coming through now. I'm refreshing your screen.

718
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,990
Okay,we're at the southeast corner entrance.

719
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,530
Jack,there's a tunnel through that door

720
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,400
that leads to a conveyor belt that lets out into the middle Nof the plant.

721
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,990
Be careful,there's a hostile at the exit.

722
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,890
Copy that.

723
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,050
Draw your weapon.

724
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,480
Let's go.

725
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,110
Bravo,check.Have you got a visual on the mark?

726
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,700
Negative,sir.

727
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,570
All units holding.

728
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,180
Copy.

729
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,340
This way.

730
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,640
Let's go.

731
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,350
Damn it, there's too many of them.

732
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,920
We're running out of time.

733
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,630
I'm gonna need you to take out one of their guards

734
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,830
so I can climb to the top of this structure and take out the sniper.

735
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,080
He's about a hundred yards north of here,

736
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,750
just on the other side of the conveyor belt.

737
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,670
Can you do that?

738
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,560
Yeah. I can do it.

739
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,110
Wait. One of them's moving.

740
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,660
Go.

741
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,150
Mr. Palmer, can you hear me?

742
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,880
Copy. I'm on the south side of the lower belt moving west.

743
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,610
Continue to the end,your target's to the north.

744
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,400
Jack,it's all clear.

745
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,270
This is Bravo.

746
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,930
I think I hear a car.

747
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,210
Vehicle headed north.

748
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,110
Single occupant,female,over.

749
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,740
Bravo,what have you got?

750
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,230
I repeat,Bravo, what have you got?

751
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,780
Come in,Bravo.

752
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,200
Say again. I didn't get that.

753
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,700
I repeat,woman is alone...in the car

754
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,550
Copy.

755
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,050
Chloe,we've taken out four men.

756
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,340
Evelyn has moved into position.Wayne,I want you to wait for my signal.

757
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,170
Copy.

758
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,240
We need Henderson alive.Do not shoot to kildl.do not shoot to kill.

759
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,960
Yes?

760
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,230
Evelyn,open all the doors and the trunk of the car.

761
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:19,730
Very good,Evelyn.Now go to the front of the car and drop the keys on the ground.

762
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,250
I have the evidence with me.

763
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,520
I want my daughter.

764
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,190
Bravo,hold your position.I'm coming out.

765
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,170
I have a visual on Henderson and the girl.

766
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay,Evelyn, give me the evidence.

767
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,170
I'll give you the evidence once you give me Amy.

768
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,030
Come on,let her go.

769
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,810
Okay,honey,go see Mommy.

770
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,950
Mommy!

771
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,990
She's moving.

772
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,940
Give me the evidence,Evelyn.

773
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,180
Get down. Get down.

774
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,910
Bravo,check. Come in.

775
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,230
Bravo. Come in,Bravo.

776
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,080
Wayne,I didn't get him. If you got a shot,take it.

777
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,260
Chloe,it's Jack.Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car.

778
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,480
Do you have him on satellite?

779
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,600
We saw it,Jack,but he's leaving the search grid.

780
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,980
We're thermal-scanning the plant,not the entire neighborhood.

781
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,950
Well then reprogram it! We can't lose him!

782
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,840
Is she all right?

783
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,340
Evelyn's been hit.

784
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,830
The bullet passed right through.It hasn't hit an artery.

785
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,480
It's not serious,but it's gonna have to be dressed.

786
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,100
Evelyn,you've got your daughter back,

787
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,660
now tell me what I need to know.

788
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,540
Who is behind this? Is it the vice president?

789
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,860
Evelyn,is it the vice president?

790
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,080
The vice president has nothing to do with this.

791
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,920
You promised me you would control the situation.

792
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,090
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up,sir.

793
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,880
He outmaneuvered me.

794
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,530
Sir,Bauer and Wayne Palmer won't be around long enough

795
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,040
to tell anybody else what they know.

796
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,720
I'm putting together another team.

797
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,820
I will handle this,sir, I promise you.

798
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,390
I will not let you down.

799
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,680
See that you don't.
