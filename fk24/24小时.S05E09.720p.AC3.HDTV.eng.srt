1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,300
Jack Bauer is currently undercover

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,800
with some of the terrorists.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,360
They're expecting Jack to help them release a single canister of

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,900
Sentox nerve gas in the Sunrise Hills Shopping Mall.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,460
Do you mean to actually let them release the Sentox?

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,800
Are you out of your mind?

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,700
We have the terrorists under surveillance.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,350
Even if they kill Bauer,

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,560
we will be able to track them back to the remaining canisters.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,230
I'll go along with your assessment.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,770
Let them release the Sentox,

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,020
but you'd better find those other canisters

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,260
or those people will have died in vain.

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,260
There is still time to move in and stop them

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,700
before they murder all those people.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,430
Audrey, we have a directive from the President.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,900
Do you realize how many more people could die if these men

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,470
don't lead us to the other 19 canisters?

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,000
Lynn, you tell me, if you were in Jack's shoes

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,190
could you follow through with that order

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,830
stand by and watch as they murder all those people?

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,500
If those are the orders of the president?

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,260
Yes, I would have to!

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,330
The trigger's been reconfigured.

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,630
You can activate the canisters now.

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,730
Better hope it works.

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,960
What's the unlock code?

28
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,060
Jack, the unlock code is alpha-kilo-charlie.

29
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,330
Ecko-bravo-charlie.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,100
Jack, this is a direct order from the president.

31
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,960
Now enter the correct code and let them release the gas.

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,000
Now!

33
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,230
Make it work!

34
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,860
I told you there's nothing I can do!

35
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,230
They have another way to release the gas.

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,860
I managed to stop the flow of gas,

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,300
but some got into the air system.

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,000
We need to evacuate the mall now.

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,160
What about the terrorists?

40
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,930
One's dead, one escaped.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,700
Monitor the tracking device in the remote trigger.

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,460
The hostile that escaped still had it on him.

43
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,030
I managed to activate the valve before I got away.

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,200
At least some of the gas was released into the mall.

45
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,000
What do you want me to do?

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,400
Come back here.

47
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,600
You were followed.

48
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,560
You know what to do.

49
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,460
No!

50
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,460
Hostile down!

51
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,400
Erwich is gone, the canisters are gone.

52
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,830
We've got nothing here.

53
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,430
Damn it!

54
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,890
The following takes place between 3Pm and 4Pm

55
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,830
Despite an attempt by extremists to derail the process,

56
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,660
the treaty was signed earlier today by President Logan

57
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,030
and Russian President Yuri Suvarov.

58
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,900
Officials from each country are hailing the agreement

59
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,960
as a major milestone in U.S.-Russian relations.

60
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,420
The White House Press Secretary has called

61
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,800
this a critical achievement in diplomacy

62
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,030
and will set the course for President...

63
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,530
Sentox gas is genuine.

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,520
The test was successful.

65
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,960
I spent a year securing a weapon

66
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,200
that would bring Moscow to its knees.

67
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,660
And you waste it killing a handful

68
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,000
of American civilians.

69
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,630
We were betrayed, Bierko.

70
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,930
Someone must pay.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,230
I agree.

72
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,230
You were the one who trusted the Americans.

73
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,100
Nathanson lied to us.

74
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,960
He plotted to turn the gas against us.

75
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,360
Your trust nearly cost us everything.

76
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,730
Since I anticipated this,

77
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,000
I have secured additional men and resources

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,600
at great personal expense.

79
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,800
Have you found a way to reconfigure the canisters

80
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,430
with dispersal mechanisms?

81
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,630
Yes.

82
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,580
Do it.

83
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,830
Nathanson will be eliminated.

84
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,000
Then we will return to our original task

85
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,630
striking at the heart of Russia.

86
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,000
Where's Nathanson?

87
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,160
I don't know where he went.

88
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,260
I swear, I don't.

89
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,500
Yeah.

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,360
I took out Nathanson's men.

91
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,160
But there is no sign of Nathanson.

92
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,000
Find him.

93
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,760
Alpha-seven.

94
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,030
This is Nathanson.

95
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,460
Someone just took out my men.

96
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,530
Who?

97
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,530
I think Bierko's hitting us back.

98
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,960
Destroy all your databases.

99
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,430
I know you're there, Jenny.

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,760
Pick up the phone.

101
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,730
Damn it, Jenny, I need the keycard from my wallet!

102
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,130
Look, I'll leave the police out of this.

103
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,490
You and your loser boyfriend can keep the money you stole,

104
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,460
max out my credit cards, I don't care.

105
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,800
Just give me back my keycard.

106
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,000
It's important.

107
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,560
We can't sell the keycard.

108
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,500
Why can't we just give it to him?

109
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm calling my brother.

110
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,700
No, you're not.

111
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,330
What is going on, Dwayne?

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm handling this.

113
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,430
- Jenny? - Please hold for the President.

114
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,530
Have your people recovered the nerve gas?

115
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,560
McGill?

116
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,230
Yes, sir. I'm here. I'm sorry.

117
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,760
Do you have any leads?

118
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,400
Have you intercepted the terrorists?

119
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,800
No, sir.

120
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,630
The man we followed from the mall took his own life

121
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,520
before he could be apprehended.

122
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,700
Damn it, McGill, I put this on you.

123
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,130
If you'd let the terrorists release the Sentox gas

124
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,260
in the mall as I agreed to let you do,

125
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,530
we wouldn't be where we are right now, which is nowhere.

126
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,760
- Mr. President... - Stop!

127
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,030
Stop making excuses.

128
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,230
Take responsibility and do your job.

129
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,230
Although we were able to limit the casualties

130
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,230
the attack at the mall indicates

131
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,800
that these terrorists intend to make good on their threat

132
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,330
to release the nerve gas on U.S. soil.

133
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,350
Unless we catch a break,

134
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,160
we can expect to suffer multiple attacks,

135
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,760
resulting in mass casualties.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
I assumed you'd want me to start without you.

137
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,200
Just tell me where we are.

138
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,500
LAPD is setting up a perimeter

139
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,100
around the terrorists' last known location.

140
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,460
We've activated all search protocols,

141
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,300
including satellite and Caltrans surveillance.

142
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,230
But we don't have any real leads, do we?

143
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,730
If Jack Bauer would have followed

144
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,240
orders and maintained his cover, we could have intercepted these people.

145
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,020
We don't know that for sure, Lynn.

146
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,700
What we do know is, Jack's field decision

147
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,200
saved over 800 innocent people.

148
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,220
It may well cost us 100 times that many people.

149
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,260
In the meantime

150
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,500
we've contained both the physical threat and the media's awareness,

151
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,130
which would have triggered massive civil unrest.

152
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,660
Well, you tell yourself that if you want to,

153
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,030
Ms. Raines, but the fact remains that these terrorists

154
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,030
are at large with 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas,

155
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,160
and we don't know

156
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,630
where or when they're gonna hit us next.

157
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,850
We're all aware of the threat, Lynn.

158
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,370
Then why does she keep defending Bauer?

159
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,430
I want Bauer placed in custody.

160
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,360
I want him brought in here.

161
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,930
I want him held responsible for what's happened.

162
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,500
Jack can be disciplined later.

163
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
Taking him out of the field right now is a mistake.

164
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,530
Don't tell me how to do my job.

165
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,460
He was authorized by the President, Lynn.

166
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,830
But he works for me, and so do you.

167
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,830
I want him here now.

168
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,860
The rest of you,maintain your search protocols.

169
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,660
Send your progress reports to my screen in ten minutes.

170
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,330
It's all right.

171
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,060
We're all under a lot of pressure.

172
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,960
Let's get back to it.

173
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,160
Manning.

174
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,130
This is Buchanan. We have orders to bring Jack in.

175
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,460
We weren't able to find anything that confirmed this guy's identity.

176
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,650
I want you to take his picture, lift his prints,

177
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,590
get him over to CTU as soon as possible.

178
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,760
We've got nothing on this guy.

179
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,700
We're gonna have to run him through NCIC

180
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,960
and Interpol databases.

181
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,000
I just got off the phone with Bill.

182
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,000
Lynn McGill wants me to bring you back to CTU.

183
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,630
He's on some kind of warpath.

184
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,930
Why? Because I didn't think

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,900
letting terrorists release Sentox nerve gas

186
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,300
in a crowded mall was an acceptable loss?

187
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,630
And because we lost our only real lead,

188
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,630
and Lynn's looking for someone to blame.

189
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,730
I was appointed by the President of the United States.

190
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,510
It was a field call.

191
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,530
I know. And between you and me,

192
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,630
I think you made the right call back at the mall.

193
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm calling the President.

194
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,960
Look, Jack, the trail's gone cold.

195
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,200
There's no point in fighting it.

196
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,230
Let's just go back to CTU and square it.

197
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,430
Fine.

198
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,090
Look, I'm sorry,

199
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,950
but I also have to take your gun.

200
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,500
Jack, don't make this any more difficult than it already is.

201
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,260
Fine.

202
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,030
We can't afford to decommission Jack, especially now.

203
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,300
I agree.

204
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,630
What can we do about it?

205
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,800
Nothing... while Lynn's in charge.

206
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,100
He may be in charge, Bill, but he is not in control.

207
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,060
Ms. Raines, you have a call on line one.

208
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,850
Thank you.

209
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,350
I'll be filtering intel at Station Three.

210
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,900
Audrey Raines.

211
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,600
Ms. Raines, if you try to trace this call

212
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,890
or put anyone else on the line, I will hang up.

213
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,680
Who is this?

214
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,700
My name is James Nathanson.

215
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,700
I'm sure Walt Cummings has already told you all about me.

216
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,600
You're the one who sold the nerve gas to the terrorists.

217
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,800
That's close enough to the truth.

218
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,360
What do you want?

219
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,530
Transfer me to Jack Bauer on a clean line.

220
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Why Jack?

221
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,830
That's not your concern.

222
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,200
You're getting to Jack through me.

223
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,130
That makes it my concern.

224
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm going through you

225
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,800
because I know you have a special relationship with Bauer.

226
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,960
I know all about you, Ms. Raines.

227
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,130
Which is why I'm counting on you to recognize

228
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,230
an opportunity when it presents itself.

229
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,030
What opportunity?

230
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,360
I can help you find this nerve gas.

231
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,330
How do I know you're telling the truth?

232
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,560
You don't.

233
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,130
Now put me through to Bauer.

234
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,730
This is Bauer.

235
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,660
Jack, I know you're with Curtis, so I'm assuming

236
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,100
that you can't speak freely.

237
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,800
It's Audrey.

238
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,030
It's personal.

239
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,430
Go ahead.

240
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,860
Thanks.

241
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,100
I'm on the phone with a man who claims to be James Nathanson.

242
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,730
He was Walt Cummings' contact.

243
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,700
He says he has information about the terrorists,

244
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,900
but he will only talk to you.

245
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,060
Why me?

246
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,400
You can hang up now, Ms. Raines.

247
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,600
My phone has a node monitor.

248
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,220
I'll know if anyone else comes on this line.

249
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,330
- Jack? - That's all right, Audrey. Hang up the phone.

250
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,830
All right.

251
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,630
- What do you want with me? - Protection.

252
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,060
The terrorists you're after are trying to kill me.

253
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,270
If the terrorists figured out that you were the one who rigged

254
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,360
the canisters of Sentox to blow up in their faces,

255
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,500
what do you need me for?

256
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,860
Just turn yourself in to the authorities.

257
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,530
They'll protect you. Walt Cummings isn't

258
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,630
the only one behind this operation who works inside the government.

259
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,760
I need your help.

260
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,560
You conspired to have me take the fall

261
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,500
for President Palmer's assassination.

262
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,760
What makes you think I'm not

263
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,480
going to kill you myself?

264
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,610
Because you want to stop the Sentox gas

265
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,730
from being released on American soil.

266
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,730
So do I.

267
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,520
Where are you?

268
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,530
There's a phone booth on the south side of Moorpark,

269
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,860
just east of Densmore.

270
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,630
Be there in ten minutes, or I'll be gone.

271
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,900
Moorpark and Densmore. Got it.

272
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,930
Jack?

273
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,560
Audrey, I'll explain everything as soon as I get back to CTU.

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,030
Thanks.

275
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,800
It's going to be strange for her.

276
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,200
Audrey. Just yesterday, she thought you were dead.

277
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,760
Yeah.

278
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,790
I know it's none of my business,

279
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,760
but she's a good person, Jack.

280
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,110
I hope you two get half a chance.

281
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,860
Thanks.

282
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,730
Jack!

283
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,060
Don't fight, Curtis.

284
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,660
Don't fight it.

285
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,550
Lynn McGill.

286
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,370
It's Curtis. Jack escaped.

287
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,840
What?

288
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,320
He got a call from someone. The next thing I know,

289
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,880
he blindsided me, took my car.

290
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,300
Who called him?

291
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,930
He said it was Audrey, but he may have been lying.

292
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,790
Lynn?

293
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,550
We can try to track him using your vehicle's onboard transceiver.

294
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,720
I just tried bringing it up on my PDA.

295
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,030
He's either disabled or shut down the transceiver.

296
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,110
Curtis, how could you let this happen?

297
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,240
I'll get dispatch on it.

298
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,880
One of my team's en route to pick me up.

299
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,350
We'll find him.

300
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,640
You don't even know where to look.

301
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,700
Get back to CTU. We'll deploy from here.

302
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,240
Damn it.

303
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,370
Chloe, run a triangulation on Jack Bauer's cell phone.

304
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,100
- Find out where he is.- Yes, sir.

305
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,350
Have you talked to Jack since he's been in custody?

306
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,650
- No. - Well, he's not in custody anymore.

307
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,440
He assaulted Curtis and stole his car.

308
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,890
Why would he do that?

309
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,690
Maybe you can tell me.

310
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,870
I don't know where Jack is, if that's what you're asking me.

311
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,020
You have no idea what he's doing?

312
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,550
No, but I'm sure there's an explanation.

313
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,230
Mr. McGill, we're not getting a signal from Jack's cell.

314
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,240
The sim card must be out of his phone.

315
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,910
Well, if you think of anything you'll let me know, right?

316
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,130
Of course.

317
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,780
Thanks.

318
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,110
O'Brian.

319
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,350
Chloe, what I'm about to tell you needs to stay between us.

320
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,680
It involves Jack.

321
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,460
What is going on? It just came on my screen that Jack's gone missing.

322
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,360
He's following a lead on the Sentox gas.

323
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,420
He needed to go alone.

324
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,270
I just transferred a call from my station to him.

325
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,870
I need you to delete the record.

326
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,680
If Lynn finds out we're working behind his back...

327
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,700
Chloe, I know. Believe me, I know.

328
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,050
But this is the only way.

329
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,830
There isn't a lot of time.

330
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,530
When did you make the call?

331
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,510

332
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,670
This is Lynn McGill.

333
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,200
Bring up the phone logs at the station Audrey Raines is using

334
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,450
Yes, sir.

335
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,680
I found the transfer. I can't dump just the one call.

336
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,020
They're all cross-indexed.

337
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,060
Can't you unlink it?

338
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,450
No. It would take like two hours.

339
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,170
Okay, Mr. McGill,

340
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,220
the call logs should be on your screen.

341
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,260
Scroll through to station five.

342
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,050
That's the one we dedicated to the DOD.

343
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,140
The only way to get rid of the entry

344
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,470
is to dump the entire log...

345
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,810
all the calls you've made and received today.

346
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,350
Do it.

347
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,330
It's done.

348
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,910
Thank you, Chloe.

349
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,050
...a day that will long be remembered as a step forward

350
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,270
for both the United States and Russia.

351
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,940
President Logan and President Suvarov

352
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,170
are expected shortly to deliver their closing remarks.

353
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,960
Following this, the Russian head of...

354
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,920
What is it now, Mike?

355
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,090
I'm sorry, sir,

356
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,000
but there's a call you need to take. It just came in on this.

357
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,090
And what is that?

358
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,200
Walt Cummings' phone, sir.

359
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,760
It's been in Secret Service custody.

360
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,350
They just brought it to me.

361
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,460
The caller's claiming he has the Sentox gas.

362
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,420
Is someone tracing the call?

363
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,430
They can't.

364
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,860
It's being sent through multiple relays.

365
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,190
I'm not talking to a terrorist.

366
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,170
You talk to them. You find out what he wants.

367
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,900
Mr. President, he's demanding to speak with you.

368
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,010
All right.

369
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,330
But put him on speaker.

370
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,770
This is President Logan.

371
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,930
Is this Erwich?

372
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,500
Ivan Erwich is no longer with us, Mr. President.

373
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,280
His attack on your shopping mall

374
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,060
was unsanctioned and unwarranted.

375
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,330
It didn't serve our interests.

376
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,290
What is it you want?

377
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:57,040
What I want is to release the Sentox nerve gas on Moscow.

378
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,990
Since that is now impossible,

379
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm forced to strike at Russia on foreign soil...

380
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,900
with your help.

381
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,430
My help?

382
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,180
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.

383
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,290
His entire route to the airport,

384
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,090
along with a full profile of his security detail.

385
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,240
I...I don't personally have that information.

386
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,620
Then get it.

387
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,530
Make no mistake, Mr. President,

388
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,050
it's our Russian oppressors

389
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,640
I mean to hurt, not your people.

390
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,000
However, if you refuse to cooperate,

391
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,400
I will have no choice but to release all of the Sentox gas in areas

392
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,320
far more populated than your shopping mall.

393
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,800
You just said that killing Americans didn't serve your interests.

394
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,600
This...

395
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,040
this would be senseless murder.

396
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,850
Yes, it would.

397
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,090
So give me Suvarov's route.

398
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,180
I'll need some time.

399
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,870
You have 15 minutes.

400
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,380
I'm... I'm not sure...

401
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,780
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

402
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,540
We can't let that happen.

403
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,910
If the Russian president is killed on U.S. soil,

404
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,750
it wouldn't just nullify the treaty...

405
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,290
it would destroy our relationship with Moscow.

406
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,440
Get me Suvarov's route from Secret Service.

407
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,320
Mr. President...

408
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,460
No, I haven't made any decision yet, Mike,

409
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,270
but whatever I decide, I'd better have the route in hand

410
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,840
when he calls back, don't you think?

411
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,730
Yes, sir.

412
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,780
Somebody's screwing with me, Bill.

413
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,170
I won't tolerate it.

414
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,100
Screwing with you how?

415
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,190
Audrey Raines' phone log has been erased.

416
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,200
What?

417
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,590
Take a look.

418
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,090
Probably a system glitch.

419
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,760
It wasn't a glitch. She did it on purpose.

420
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,540
Audrey? You think Audrey did this?

421
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,530
- I know she did. - That's ridiculous.

422
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,650
She's one of the most by-the-book people I know.

423
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,040
when you're trying to hide something.

424
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,460
Did you know that she was on the phone

425
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,760
with Jack right beforehe attacked Curtis?

426
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,480
No, I didn't know that. What... what does that prove?

427
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,910
There's something going on with these two.

428
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,100
What's their history?

429
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,780
You know their history, Lynn. They worked together at DOD.

430
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,440
There's more than that, right?

431
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,450
- It got personal later on, Lynn. - Personal?

432
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,800
And you didn't think it was important to tell me that?

433
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,950
No, I didn't.

434
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,000
What difference does that make?

435
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,460
When did she find out Jack was still alive?

436
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,220
This morning, with the rest of us.

437
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,450
You sure about that?

438
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,080
I was there, Lynn. I saw her reaction.

439
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
Could have been an act.

440
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,960
You're starting to sound paranoid.

441
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,230
I don't care how I sound.

442
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,160
From this point on, I want all our people on a tight leash.

443
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,860
If someone has a hidden agenda, I want to know about it.

444
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,790
CTU's become way too porous, and that's your fault, Bill.

445
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,860
I don't need to hear this from you.

446
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,970
You don't want to hear this from me?

447
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,340
Then tell me why Audrey erased her phone logs.

448
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,570
I'm here. Where are you?

449
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,690
In a minute. First, I want to make sure that you weren't followed.

450
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,060
Otherwise, there's no deal.

451
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,750
Take the alley between the two buildings across the street from you.

452
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,360
I left the gate open.

453
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,600
Listen to me.

454
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,890
I don't know what you think I can do for you

455
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,570
but you committed treason.

456
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,120
I don't see it that way.

457
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,960
I love this country.

458
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,660
You're never going to be able to justify killing David Palmer.

459
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,410
That was an unfortunate necessity.

460
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,310
We admired Palmer, but we had other priorities.

461
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,160
This country needs a reason to secure its oil interests in Asia

462
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,330
a reason that Russia and the rest of the world can get behind.

463
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,180
I've heard your reasoning from Walt Cummings.

464
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,490
It's still treason.

465
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,930
No. It's realpolitik.

466
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,850
- Do you see the open door ahead? - Yeah.

467
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,340
Enter it, make two right turns,

468
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,680
and walk back the direction you came from.

469
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,460
Hold on.

470
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,470
You have hostiles coming in after you.

471
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,750
- Do you have a weapon? - Yes.

472
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,100
- Where are you? - Second floor.

473
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,770
Try and make your way to the roof. I'll meet you there.Stay on the line.

474
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,830
All right.

475
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,800
All right. I understand.

476
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,330
Audrey.

477
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,200
DOD wants a fuller explanation about what happened at the mall.

478
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,440
I told them we're still trying to find a thread on the nerve gas.

479
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,600
I just spent the last five minutes getting grilled by Lynn.

480
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,790
- About what? - You and Jack.

481
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,950
Your relationship.

482
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,430
What'd you tell him?

483
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,070
The truth.

484
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,820
That you and he were once romantically involved and now I'm not sure.

485
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,530
I don't see how that's any of his business.

486
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,700
He thinks it is.

487
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,920
He thinks you had something to do with Jack breaking from custody.

488
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,010
Did you?

489
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,440
Not exactly.

490
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,850
What the hell does that mean?

491
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,480
A man claiming to be James Nathanson

492
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,110
called here about 20 minutes ago.

493
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,090
He said that he had information on terrorists.

494
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,710
That he would only give it to Jack.

495
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,750
Why didn't you tell me about this?

496
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,090
I was afraid of losing this lead. I didn't know what to do, Bill.

497
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,350
So Jack's meeting this man Nathanson alone, without backup.

498
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,510
- Where is he? - I don't know.

499
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,280
Nathanson dropped me from the call.

500
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,460
- Who else knows about this? - Just Chloe.

501
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,430
- She helped me cover the call from Lynn. - Audrey.

502
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,530
If you could just, uh, sign right here.

503
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,970
District elevated the threat level.

504
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,440
I'm briefing first responders on the high probability of multiple attacks,

505
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,540
so I need to review DOD protocols.

506
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,840
All right, I'll send them to your screen.

507
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,920
We can do it here.

508
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,450
Unless you have a problem working with me on this.

509
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,540
No. No, no, it's fine.

510
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,410
Excuse me.

511
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,680
Bauer?

512
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,870
Yeah, where are you?

513
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,390
I'm in the freight elevator.

514
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,300
You need to get out of there now. You're cornered.

515
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,430
Bauer, where are you?

516
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,420
I'm almost there. Just keep moving.

517
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,840
Nathanson, stay down!

518
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,790
Stay down!

519
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,160
Nathanson!

520
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,610
Look at me. Look at me.

521
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,840
How do I find the canisters of Sentox?

522
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,820
How do I find the canisters?

523
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,420
In my pocket.

524
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,420
What's on the chip?

525
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,950
Please. What's on the chip?!

526
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,910
Nathanson's dead, but there was someone else there.

527
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,850
Who?

528
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,900
I don't know yet.

529
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,580
But he took out three of my men and disabled the helicopter.

530
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,770
Nathanson may have given him information that compromises us.

531
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,480
Keep looking until you find him.


533
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,330
Some critics have already said that by signing this treaty,

534
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,080
we as the United States are taking on our ally's enemies

535
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,170
as well as having to deal with our own.

536
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,710
Diagram Seven lays out the hierarchy for first responders.

537
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,080
Civil Defense protocols for each agency are pretty well defined.

538
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,540
Shouldn't you get that?

539
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,640
Audrey Raines.

540
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,280
It's me. Nathanson's just been killed, but he gave me intel.

541
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,250
I need you to uplink the data.

542
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,800
Sorry, Steve, you have the wrong extension.

543
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,460
I'll transfer you to I.T.

544
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,030
Overlapping responsibilities default to federal, then to state.

545
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,470
O'Brian.

546
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,400
Chloe, it's Jack. Audrey just rolled my call over to you.

547
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,070
What the hell's going on over there?

548
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,670
It's Lynn. He's been shadowing her.

549
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,460
He thinks that she's been talking to you behind his back,

550
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,250
which I guess she has.

551
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,510
Chloe, listen to me.

552
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,940
I have a thumb drive that's gonna help us find the Sentox.

553
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,720
I need you to data mine the files.

554
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,350
Upload the drive to my socket.

555
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,520
Access code 5J55J.

556
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,780
Hold on.

557
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,610
You should be getting it now.

558
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,830
Chloe, I need you to keep this under the radar.

559
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,080
You mean keep it from Lynn.

560
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,340
At least until we know what we've got.

561
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,280
- My number come up on your screen? - Yeah.

562
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,840
Okay, I had to switch out phones. If you need to get ahold of me,

563
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,300
call me back on that number.

564
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,580
Okay, I will.

565
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,050
Suvarov's motorcade, with his security detail.

566
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,240
Sir...

567
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,480
If President Suvarov is killed,

568
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,640
and the Russians find out we

569
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,660
supplied his killers with this information,

570
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,030
it would be considered an act of war.

571
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,480
The Russian motorcade has a significant security force.

572
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,490
I see no reason to believe that

573
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,360
the terrorists would even be successful.

574
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,160
Maybe we should have an analysis done,

575
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,940
determine, uh, uh, the vulnerable points along the route.

576
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,000
Sir, we can't do that without giving away the fact

577
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,240
that we had advance knowledge of an attack.

578
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,360
What attack?

579
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,290
It's-It's nothing that you need to be concerned about.

580
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,510
Charles, you invited me into this circle.

581
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,940
What attack?

582
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,270
The terrorists want the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

583
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,220
They've threatened to deploy more Sentox gas

584
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,270
if I don't give it to them.

585
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,600
You're not...

586
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,460
seriously considering it, are you?

587
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,730
Martha... Charles believes

588
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,070
an assault on the Suvarovs has a good chance...

589
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,130
Mike, will you please let the president speak for himself?

590
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,090
May we have a moment?

591
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,180
- Charles. - Martha, please.

592
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,200
If I don't give them the information they want,

593
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,410
tens of thousands of Americans will die on our own soil...

594
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,840
maybe hundreds of thousands... and I will be responsible.

595
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,810
All right, all right, all right, Charles, Charles,

596
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,130
there has got to be another way.

597
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,540
You change their itinerary, delay Suvarov from leaving.

598
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,260
It's all over the news that the

599
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,830
Russians are leaving after we make the joint statement.

600
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,740
If there's any deviation from that,

601
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,650
the terrorists will know that I've alerted them.

602
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,940
Charles,what are you telling me? What are you saying?

603
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,560
That we are going to stand in front of the entire world

604
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,920
with the Suvarovs, you're going to look him in the eye,

605
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,180
shake his hand, knowing you're sending them to their deaths?

606
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,270
If we were in Russia and Suvarov got this ultimatum

607
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,370
do you think that he would spare us?

608
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,530
I am not talking about Russia.

609
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,650
I am not talking about Suvarov.I am talking about you.

610
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,910
You are the president of the United States of America.

611
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,910
My God! Charles!

612
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,290
You're talking about murder!

613
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,750
Martha, my back is up against the wall.

614
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,640
You... Give me another solution.

615
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,050
You stand up to them.

616
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,750
Refuse to negotiate with them.

617
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,030
Isn't that the policy of this country?

618
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,600
Isn't that the point of the treaty you've just signed?

619
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,560
It's not that simple, Martha.

620
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,020
It never is.

621
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,290
Oh, damn it.

622
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,820
Buchanan.

623
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,030
This is Chloe.

624
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,270
What is it, Chloe?

625
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,000
Jack just sent me the data he got off Nathanson.

626
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,940
My decryption filters weren't working and I just realized why.

627
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,800
The drive's DOD formatted.

628
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,480
- DOD? - Yeah.

629
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,290
I don't know how Nathanson got his hands on

630
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,980
a highly classified government t-drive.

631
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,760
Audrey's the only one with clearance.

632
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,020
Lynn's got her tied up.

633
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,460
Exactly.

634
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,170
How much time do you need?

635
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,340
To decrypt all the vectors?

636
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Two, three minutes.

637
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,540
Hang on.

638
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,490
Lynn, do you have a minute?

639
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,620
What is it?

640
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,710
You were inquiring about a security breach with the phone logs.

641
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,360
That's right.


643
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,190
We can key in the user I.D.from your office and find who we're looking for.

644
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,300
We just have to use your key card.

645
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,910
Why are you so interested in this?

646
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,320
I'm serious about all breaches of security.

647
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,180
What was that?

648
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,940
- What? - That last window you closed... what was it?

649
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,000
It was just the DOD protocols.

650
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,680
What is going on here?

651
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,470
Lynn, will you please just calm down?

652
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,770
Don't tell me to calm down!

653
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,050
The two of you are up to something

654
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,360
and I'm not gonna stand for it.

655
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,220
I think you're protecting Audrey and she's protecting Bauer.

656
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,420
Look, I can explain, Lynn.

657
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,360
So can I.

658
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,370
This was a deliberate attempt to circumvent my authority.

659
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,830
Lynn, we are all on the same side.

660
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,250
If your father wasn't the secretary of defense,

661
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,580
I'd have you thrown out of here.

662
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,020
I don't have that problem with you.

663
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,170
Can I have Security to Station Five, please, right away.

664
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,730
What are you doing, Lynn?

665
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,370
Place Mr. Buchanan in custody and take him to holding.

666
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,860
- You are making a mistake. - Audrey.

667
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,340
I want everyone's attention.

668
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,660
I'm putting a section two-three redundancy into effect as of this moment.

669
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,660
All of your stations will be mirrored and monitored through my office.

670
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,410
Now get back to work.

671
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,780
We need Bill to get through this crisis.

672
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,530
You are jeopardizing our chances of finding that nerve gas.

673
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,770
I will make sure that DOD and the Secretary of Defense are aware of that.

674
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,240
Don't threaten me, Miss. Raines.

675
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,740
I promise you, you do not want to threaten me.

676
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,870
What do you got?

677
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,450
The decryption element kicked out a company called Terra-Dyne.

678
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,650
Over the past three years, they've acquired

679
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,720
more than 100 pounds of raw strontium isotope,

680
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,080
used to create Sentox nerve gas.

681
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,240
Where do I find Terra-Dyne?

682
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,160
La Ca~ada.

683
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,140
It's a subsidiary of a larger corporation

684
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,000
called Omicron International.

685
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,220
Hold on, did you say Omicron?

686
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,600
- Yeah. - Are you sure?

687
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,830
What's wrong?

688
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,310
Pull up their senior executive roster.

689
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,350
See if a man named Christopher Henderson's on the list.

690
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,200
Why?

691
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,290
Just do it, please.

692
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,030
Okay, here it is.

693
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,760
Christopher Henderson,

694
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,330
Senior Vice President of Research and Development.

695
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,260
Do you know him?

696
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,870
Yeah, I did once.

697
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Listen, send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.

698
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,430
It's gonna be a little bit hard to do right now, Jack.

699
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,550
Lynn is watching everyone like a hawk.

700
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,150
Well, can Buchanan help you?

701
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,330
He could if he weren't in holding.

702
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,510
What are you talking about?

703
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,580
Lynn detained him for insubordination.

704
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,710
How could he do that?

705
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,000
Because he's losing it.

706
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,450
I think the President's putting too much

707
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,770
pressure on him to get those canisters.

708
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,250
He can't handle it.

709
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,410
Chloe, I still need the decrypted files.

710
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,060
You're gonna have to find a way to get them to me.

711
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,550
I'll try.

712
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,110
- They haven't called yet? - Not yet, sir.

713
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,380
President Suvarov's waiting.

714
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,770
We'll be out in a minute.

715
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,280
Excuse me.

716
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,620
Martha...

717
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,870
please.

718
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,320
This is a difficult decision for me...

719
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,220
both politically and personally.

720
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,400
And maybe I won't have to make it.

721
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,520
Maybe CTU will find the canisters before the Suvarovs have to leave.

722
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,730
That's what I'm praying for.

723
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,470
But whatever happens, I need you to understand.

724
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,220
I do.

725
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,440
I understand, Charles, I do.

726
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,380
Mr. President.

727
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,020
It has been a challenging day

728
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,640
so I especially appreciate how professional you have all been.

729
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,980
Your president is fortunate to have

730
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,140
such talented people working for him.

731
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,220
Thank you.

732
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,760
Yuri.

733
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,030
Anya.

734
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,230
Mr. President, I'm glad we have this opportunity

735
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,320
to thank you and Mrs. Logan personally for your hospitality.

736
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,600
Mr. President it's been our pleasure.

737
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,090
- Anya and I hope that you will visit us soon... - Yeah

738
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,190
Hold on.

739
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,810
We would love that.

740
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,060
Wouldn't we, Martha?

741
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,520
Yes.

742
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,900
It would be lovely.

743
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,460
Martha... thank you again for being so kind.

744
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,380
I read the text of your statement.It was excellent.

745
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,480
And congratulations again on your brilliant

746
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,570
handling of the crisis at the airport.

747
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,430
Thank you, Yuri.

748
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,380
And-And thank you for your steadfast support.

749
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,710
Have there been further developments?

750
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,330
No, no, not at all.

751
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,430
There's always pressure, huh?

752
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,120
- But everything's under control.  - yes

753
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,920
Ladies, the photographers are waiting.

754
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,410
Thank you, Mr. President.

755
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,910
The motorcade will take service roads to the 118,

756
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,960
then to the 5 Freeway...

757
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,090
- Charles... Martha, please, just... just smile and wave.

758
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,530
The motorcade will take Suvarov through this downtown corridor.

759
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,120
That will give us our best shot at destroying all the vehicles.

760
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,200
Tell our people this is where I want them to strike.

761
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,040
All right, that's it, folks. We need to move.

762
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,830
Come on.

763
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,790
Charles, you can't let them get in that car.

764
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,820
It's not too late.

765
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,200
Mr. President, Lynn McGill is calling from CTU.

766
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,500
What about?

767
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,760
He didn't say. He just asked to speak with you directly.

768
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,610
Excuse me.

769
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,530
Mr. President, I'm afraid I have to say my good-byes here.

770
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,990
Affairs of state, you know, the pressure's continuous.

771
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,040
Yes, I understand, of course.

772
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,300
Thank you, President Logan, for everything.

773
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,420
Thank you.

774
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,860
Anya.

775
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,620
Charles.

776
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,810
Mrs. Logan.

777
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,920
Aaron, I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovs.

778
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,780
You could have a car follow us.

779
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,290
We're not detailed for that.

780
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,130
I'll ride up front.

781
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,880
No, Aaron, no, that's not necessary.

782
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,600
Yes, it is.

783
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,310
Would you...

784
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,190
tell my husband where I am?

785
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,850
I hope you don't mind if I accompany you.

786
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,890
You sure your husband won't mind?

787
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,490
No, of course not.

788
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,690
This way, we'll have more time to talk.

789
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,180
I like this.

790
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,500
Ma'am, the President is being briefed by CTU right now.

791
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,950
But I left word for you.

792
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,210
Thank you.
