1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,490
Evelyn I need youto stay focused.

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,120
The recording of the phone call that you made between President Logan

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,020
and Henderson is in a safety deposit box. Which bank?

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,560
City trust and savings in agoura hills.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,620
Jack knows there's no point in going public

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,690
till he has that evidence in his hand.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,830
None of this should have happened.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,850
This whole thing was planned to make our country safer.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,620
And it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill David Palmer.

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,330
We have to focus on stopping Bauer before he finds that recording.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,490
Karen I'm issuing an executive order for the

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,240
immediateapprehension and arrest of Jack Bauer.

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,870
I want you to run point on this and I want you to make this ctu's top priority.

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,950
Understood sir.

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,780
You know  if we really want to find Bauer

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,930
we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,830
starting with Audrey Raines.

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,630
Don't fill your father in on the particulars.

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,770
Just set up the meeting.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,010
I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording.

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,450
I need to see you in person.

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,280
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles?

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,380
All right yes.

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,730
I'll see you there.

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,120
Jack are you aware President Logan's issued a warrant for your arrest?

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,810
The vice President's not the one who's behind this is he?

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,360
No. It's Logan.

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,660
As soon as we have the evidence in hand

29
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,530
we're going to pass it off to secretary of defense Heller.

30
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,920
It had to be done sir.

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,350
I decide what needs to be done  Mr. Henderson.

32
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,620
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,690
You know what we need.

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,520
The instant that Bauer steps outside that bank building you take him down.

35
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,430
Kill the others and secure the recording.

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,050
We got the evidence.

37
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,070
Have you listened to it?

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,990
Yeah there's no doubt it's Logan.

39
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,360
We're talking about taking down the President of the United States.

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,720
The Follwing Takes Place Between 12Am and 1Am.

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,770
This checkpoint is just one of many that have been in place for several hours now.

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,120
Despite his announcement that Los Angeles is no longer under threat of attack

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,010
President Logan has ordered that martial law

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,570
remain in effect.

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,310
While the move has drawn criticism from lawmakers and civil rights advocates

46
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,270
the President is defending his decision as a necessary precaution.

47
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,530
he's citing the need...

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,490
-Yes. -It's me.

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,790
Is Bauer dead?

50
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,760
Not yet Mr. President.

51
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,960
You said your men had him.

52
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,510
Bauer triggered the bank alarm.

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,700
The authorities came before our men could get to him.

54
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,320
Bauer used the cover of the firefight to slip away.

55
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,720
He has the recording?

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,960
Yes sir.

57
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,480
That evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death.

58
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,140
Only if he gets it to someone who can do something about it.

59
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,820
We'll have Bauer before that happens.

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,820
How?

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,590
Mr. President you've established direct control over ctu

62
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,550
and ctu is heading up the search effort for Bauer.

63
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,400
You're putting an awful lot of faith in their ability.

64
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,960
This city is locked down.

65
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,490
Ctu will find Bauer  and when they do

66
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,000
make sure you're the first to know so my men can intercept.

67
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,230
Yes Mr. President?

68
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,770
Karen Hayes at ctu. Put it through to my office.

69
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,470
We're sifting satellite and caltrans video for Audrey Raines's vehicle.

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,610
I've distributed her file photo to military checkpoints throughout the city.

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,230
If she used her dod credentials at any of them

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,230
there should be a record.

73
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,210
Well I hope we're not wasting our resources on Raines

74
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,050
when we don't even know she's helping Bauer.

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,660
Karen she dumped the tracker.

76
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,850
There's a reason she doesn't want to be followed.

77
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,000
Miss Hayes  the President's on line one.

78
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,780
Yes Mr. President.

79
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,880
Where are we Ms. Hayes?

80
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,250
Still running active manhunts on both Jack Bauer and Christopher Henderson.

81
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,180
I told you to prioritize Bauer.

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,500
I have sir. I've allocated my resources accordingly.

83
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,420
If David Palmer's killer is still at large when the morning news cycle begins

84
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,730
then all the success we've had handling these terrorists will be undermined.

85
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,720
I will find Bauer sir.

86
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,940
You let me know the moment you do.

87
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,970
Yes Mr. President.

88
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,670
Bauer right?

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,330
Audrey Raines.

90
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,780
She knows where he is

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,150
and those protocols aren't going to be enough to track her.

92
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,300
You still think Chloe helped Audrey break surveillance?

93
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,810
I'm sure of it.

94
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,390
Remember

95
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,270
Audrey insisted Chloe be assigned to her.

96
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,500
Then we need to confront Chloe.

97
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,020
No no no no no. She'll just deny it.

98
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,970
There's a way we can use her to find Bauer.

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,800
It's all right. It's him.

100
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,200
Bill over here.

101
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,260
Jack.

102
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,670
Bill Buchanan

103
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,090
Wayne Palmer.

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,120
Sorry about your brother.

105
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,740
What the hell's going on Jack?

106
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,640
The military authority

107
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,600
every law enforcement agency across this country has a warrant for my arrest.

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,960
What for?

109
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,770
Killing David Palmer.

110
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,820
That's impossible. We cleared you this morning.

111
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,650
I'm being set up again  this time by President Logan.

112
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,580
He was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.

113
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,880
My god you're serious.

114
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,880
Logan's using the military to try and stop me from exposing him.

115
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,440
Mr. Buchanan we have the evidence:

116
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,350
A digital recording of a conversation made between

117
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,120
President Logan and Christopher Henderson.

118
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,970
I need to get the recording to secretary Heller.

119
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,850
He's gonna take it to the attorney general

120
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,130
and they'll file for the warrant.

121
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,890
But until then Wayne's a target.

122
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,410
I need you to take him somewhere safe.

123
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,860
Of course I will.

124
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,410
Where are you gonna meet Heller?

125
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,730
Van nuys airport.

126
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,400
Yeah.

127
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,540
Jack my father landed.Where are you?

128
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,680
I just dropped Wayne Palmer off with Buchanan.

129
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,170
I'm on my way to the airport now.

130
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,530
All right I'm on the north side of the emergency runway at hangar 112.

131
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,580
I'll be there in a few minutes.

132
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,910
All right hurry.

133
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,150
Dad.

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,460
-Hi sweetheart. -Hi.

135
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,540
Thank you so much for doing this.

136
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,170
Well I don't know what it is I'm doing so don't thank me yet.

137
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,580
These men in your security detail  do you trust them?

138
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,050
With my life.

139
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,630
Dad I need to be sure that they are loyal to you.

140
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,770
What's going on?

141
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,030
Dad I will tell you but only you.

142
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,410
Stay here.

143
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,960
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark.

144
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,080
Tell me what this is all about.

145
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,750
I promise I will.

146
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,480
I just need a minute.

147
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,810
Mr. Secretary.

148
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,700
What the hell are you doing here?

149
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,990
He's a fugitive.

150
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,190
Every law enforcement agency in this state is looking for him.

151
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,180
He's innocent.

152
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,930
Then why don't you turn yourself in?

153
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,220
Mr. Secretary I swear to you

154
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,790
I had nothing to do with David Palmer's assassination.

155
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,730
I'd like to believe you Jack

156
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,060
but you're acting like a criminal.

157
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,550
I don't have a choice; they're setting me up.

158
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,820
Mr. Secretary  I only need you for a few minutes.

159
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,490
I need to show you something

160
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,900
but privately

161
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,510
inside the building please.

162
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,580
Thank you sir.

163
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,470
It had to be done sir.

164
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,000
I decide what needs to be done  Mr. Henderson.

165
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,300
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.

166
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,130
-Palmer was nosing around. -President Logan?

167
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,630
And a man named Christopher Henderson.

168
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,160
He'd have found out about your involvement.

169
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,330
For god's sake sir he called your wife.

170
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,410
I can handle my wife.

171
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,560
Right now my concern is keeping

172
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,400
this operation from collapsing like a house of cards.

173
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,430
You're protected sir.

174
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,410
Every thread ends with cummings.

175
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,640
He thinks he's running this  and you need to keep playing it that way.

176
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,600
I know my part Mr. Henderson.

177
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,270
You just do as you're told.

178
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,330
President Logan supplied the terrorists with the sentox nerve gas.

179
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,240
What?

180
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,110
His plan was to deploy the nerve gas en route to moscow.

181
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,010
That way he could expose the terrorists and use them

182
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,460
as an excuse to invoke the military terms

183
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,910
of the agreement that he made earlier with Suvarov.

184
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,900
This was all in an effort to gain control of the oil supply in central asia.

185
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,720
David Palmer found out about it  and that's why they killed him.

186
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,240
How do you know that recording hasn't been fabricated?

187
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,580
I trust the source.

188
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,470
Mr. Secretary I promise you  this will stand up under scrutiny.

189
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,450
I wish I could say I was surprised but I'm not.

190
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,850
I watched Charles Logan

191
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,150
rise on the tide of his own ambition.

192
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,440
I was terrified when he took the oath.

193
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,150
Sir I'm very sorry that I had to involve you

194
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,520
but I needed someone who had access to hand-deliver this to the attorney general.

195
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,400
So you contacted me.

196
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,790
You're the only one I could trust.

197
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,780
All right then.

198
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,160
Thank you sir.

199
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,300
You need to go with your father.

200
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,210
He's going to need someone to corroborate the evidence to the attorney general.

201
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,180
What about you?

202
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,690
I'm going to go dark until the attorney general comes forward.

203
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,620
I'll call Buchanan; I'll let him know what's happening.

204
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,090
All right. Jack  everything's going to be okay now.

205
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
Yeah. Go.

206
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,270
Okay.

207
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,920
Jack one more thing.

208
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,490
What sir?

209
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,530
-dad what are you doing? ! -Secure my daughter.

210
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,010
You're playing a dangerous game here Jack

211
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,900
and you're playing it wrong.

212
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,390
Turning Logan's crime into a public spectacle will not bring back David Palmer.

213
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,350
It'll tear this nation apart.

214
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
You're not only destroying the President

215
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,910
you'll be destroying the presidency.

216
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,370
The collateral damage of the truth

217
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,280
will cripple this nation.

218
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,360
So what are you going to do? Bury the evidence?

219
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,520
No.

220
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,410
You're coming with me Audrey

221
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,840
and we'll use the evidence

222
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,810
to get Logan to step down quietly.

223
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,350
Once he's gone we'll have a chance to set things right again.

224
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,280
Doug I'm trusting you to keep this item safe.

225
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,860
Audrey are you coming with me or not?

226
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,910
Dad I can't.

227
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,650
Then secure them both until you hear from me.

228
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,320
Dad please no!

229
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,150
Mr. Secretary

230
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,200
you can't make a deal with him!

231
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,170
You can't trust him!

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,870
Excuse me.

233
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,340
Do you know what's going on in the situation room?

234
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,650
It's some sort of briefing.

235
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,550
No one told me.

236
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,030
It's a class 3.That's all I know.

237
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm a department head. I should be in all class 3s.

238
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,690
That's all I know.

239
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Shari what was that briefing about?

240
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,530
Just a protocol review.

241
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,990
-I don't believe you. -Why not?

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,220
'Cause you're a bad liar.

243
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,540
Miles just gave me a bunch of busywork

244
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,540
to do in the archives room to keep me out of the briefing.

245
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,260
Do you ever think there might be a reason he kept you out?

246
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,880
He thinks I helped Audrey break her surveillance.

247
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,080
Is that what it was about?

248
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,070
I've already said too much.

249
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,480
Please don't ask me any more questions.

250
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,980
Come on Shari

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,920
you owe me. I stuck my neck out for you with Miles.

252
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,440
Tell me what happened in there.

253
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,450
Miles found Audrey. He activated a transponder on her car.

254
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,870
So they know where she is?

255
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,020
We're running an operational support right now.

256
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,700
That's what the briefing was about.

257
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,780
They sent a tac team ten minutes ago.

258
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,590
Please don't tell anyone I said anything.

259
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,540
Here she comes.

260
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,380
Damn she's good.

261
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,490
She set up a proprietary com channel.

262
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,800
How long will it take to track her call?

263
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,430
Not long.

264
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,940
Pick up.

265
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,390
somewhere in the valley.

266
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,160
Looks like a pay phone.

267
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,940
I've got the receiving end narrowed down to a one-mile radius.

268
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,170
Why isn't Audrey picking up?

269
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,830
Narrowing...

270
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,740
-Got it. -Where?

271
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,100
Van nuys airport the emergency runway

272
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,550
adjacent to the main field.

273
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,450
Move the tac team out now.

274
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,780
Van nuys airport. Miles is forwarding the coordinates.

275
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,430
Get me the President.

276
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,830
You said they sent the tac team ten minutes ago.

277
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,710
Miles set me up and you helped.

278
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,480
You're working against us Chloe.

279
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,860
You have no idea what you've done.

280
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,760
-Miles said that... -Miles is an idiot.

281
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,410
If anyone should know that it should be you.

282
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,640
I can't believe you went along with him.

283
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,140
Please come with us Ms. O'brian.

284
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,510
-Where are we going?  -Let's go.

285
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,880
Mr. President I need to remind you that we still don't have

286
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,770
confirmation that Audrey Raines and Bauer are at the location.

287
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,150
You'll find out soon enough.

288
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,190
I'll have the military authority follow up on it.

289
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,420
The military?  Sir  I just dispatched my tac team.

290
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,590
Call them back.

291
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,900
I don't understand...

292
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,190
Jack Bauer is a very sensitive problem.

293
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,910
There are political ramifications.

294
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,170
I've decided to handle him directly.

295
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,930
And besides  you must have your hands full

296
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,040
transitioning ctu to homeland security.

297
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,860
I'll recall my team sir.

298
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,920
Good.

299
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,990
Now the President wants oversight on the Bauer operation.

300
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,590
He's the President. He can do what he wants.

301
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,730
Yeah.

302
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,480
Ctu thinks they found Bauer.

303
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,760
Where?

304
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,910
Jack what if my father's right?

305
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,040
What if he can get Logan to step down quietly?

306
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,140
Maybe that is the best thing for this country.

307
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,130
These people brokered chemical weapons to terrorists.

308
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,200
They've killed an ex-President of the United States.

309
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,870
Logan's not going to make a deal with your father

310
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,450
and even if he did he wouldn't keep it.

311
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,220
Henderson wouldn't let him.

312
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,760
The only thing your father's doing right now is making himself a target.

313
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,250
You want to help him?

314
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,920
Help me get the recording back before he speaks to Logan.

315
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,690
Look Mike this isn't me being territorial

316
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,280
but if the President wants Jack Bauer

317
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,870
why doesn't he let us take care of it?

318
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,580
Now look I've been on other things.

319
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,420
Let me find out what's going on.

320
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,470
I'll get back to you karen.

321
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,010
Thank you Mike.

322
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,230
...Will be lifted within the next two hours

323
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,650
but the curfew will remain in effect...

324
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,280
Come in.

325
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,790
That's only six hours from now.

326
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,320
Okay.

327
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,770
David Palmer's body's being flown back to dc at 7:00 A.M.

328
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,750
The President and I both want to be there when the coffin's put onto the plane.

329
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,910
-That's a good idea. -Yeah.

330
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,370
What's up Mike?

331
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,340
I just got a call from karen Hayes at ctu.

332
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,660
Do you know about the President's decision

333
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,990
to pull them off the acquisition of Jack Bauer?

334
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,220
No but what's the problem?

335
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,110
The problem is it doesn't really make sense.

336
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,820
Karen's teams are closer. They can do it more efficiently.

337
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,960
Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them

338
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,080
than with a group of military police he doesn't know.

339
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,460
Well karen and her team have barely gotten ctu back on its feet.

340
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,320
I'm sure the President just feels more confident

341
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,840
with the military units already in place because of martial law.

342
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,220
Well the military has its hands full Hal.

343
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,610
What do you want me to say Mike?

344
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,990
It's the President's call.

345
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,740
I can see it both ways.

346
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,590
Yeah?

347
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,170
DOD Operations.

348
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,020
Beth it's Mike Novick. Put me through to general Warren please.

349
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,810
Yes sir.

350
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,020
this is Warren.

351
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,000
Sir I have Mike Novick on the line for you.

352
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Go ahead beth.

353
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,450
You are connected.

354
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,560
What is it Mike?

355
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,950
General can you give me an update on your search for Jack Bauer?

356
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,250
What are you talking about?

357
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,970
The one the President ordered.

358
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,230
We never received such a call from the President.

359
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,500
I see.

360
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,430
I-I'm sorry to disturb you general.

361
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,180
You should try to get some rest  Mr. President.

362
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,030
Yes I know. I should try to get some rest.

363
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,050
What is it you want Mike?

364
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,860
I just got off the phone with general Warren

365
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,370
who's running military operations here in Los Angeles.

366
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,270
Why would you be talking with him?

367
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,730
Karen Hayes over at homeland raised a few good points I thought I'd follow up on.

368
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,590
What good points Mike?

369
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,250
She doesn't understand why she was taken

370
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,610
out of the loop on this Jack Bauer situation.

371
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,450
You know I really don't care what karen Hayes understands.

372
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,680
She should be doing her job and not bothering my advisors

373
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,730
asking questions that diminish my authority.

374
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,850
Be that as it may I did follow up and

375
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,550
now frankly

376
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,630
I'm a little mystified by some things.

377
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,570
What things mystify you Mike?

378
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,010
Well you told homeland that you wanted the military to pick up Jack Bauer

379
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,760
but I just spoke with general Warren

380
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,840
and he's unaware of any such directive.

381
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,520
Because I didn't go through general Warren.

382
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
May I ask who you did go through?

383
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,480
Mike let's get one thing straight:

384
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,390
I don't answer to you.

385
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,930
Of course not sir.

386
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,380
However I will tell you this:

387
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,430
I-I have decided to use a covert task force to bring in Jack Bauer.

388
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,870
The reason I'm doing that is because Bauer presents...

389
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,260
special circumstances.

390
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,830
Special circumstances?

391
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,530
I want this completely off the radar Mike.

392
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,270
The Chinese government may still believe that Jack Bauer is dead.

393
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,630
If they find out that he's alive  they're going to blame us.

394
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,040
They're going to uh accuse us

395
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,230
of fabricating the story of his death.

396
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,210
wouldn't we be keeping the circle smaller if we let karen handle this?

397
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,450
Her people already know about Bauer.

398
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,070
They're working under a secretive mandate.

399
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,530
You know what Mike?  I am tired of being second-guessed.

400
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,580
I've been dealing with-with-with... wall-to-wall crises for the last 18 hours

401
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,510
and I think I've done a pretty damn good job of leading the country.

402
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,690
Of course Mr. President.

403
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,000
You came in here suggesting that I should get some rest.

404
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,370
That's the one recommendation of yours that I intend to take.

405
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,260
Thank you Mike.

406
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,670
We traced your call

407
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,740
to a public phone at van nuys airport.

408
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,960
If Audrey Raines is at that location  you're in a lot of trouble.

409
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,460
Miles this situation is more complicated than you think.

410
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,210
-You have no idea what you're dealing with. -But you do.

411
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,860
-Yes. -Then why didn't you tell me?

412
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,000
Because I can't.

413
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,340
You think the rules don't apply to you because you're smarter than the rest of us

414
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,710
but I have news for you. They do and you're not.

415
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,690
I won't miss you when you're gone.

416
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,130
Miles.

417
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,990
Don't touch me.

418
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,420
What?

419
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,150
Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer.

420
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,160
He's a federal fugitive wanted for the murder of a former President

421
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,010
which means you're going to jail O'brian.

422
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,200
For a long time.

423
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,260
Miles.

424
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,880
I don't think you're as big of a jerk as you pretend to be.

425
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,750
-I need to speak to you. -Yes sir.

426
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,650
What are you doing Chloe?

427
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,000
You're supposed to be in custody.

428
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,960
Miles let me out.

429
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,350
You're a worse liar than I am.

430
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,610
Shari don't do that.

431
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,650
You helped Audrey Raines break surveillance.

432
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,720
Yes I did it for a good reason. I can't get into it right now.

433
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,370
Well I don't really think you have a choice.

434
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,440
Listen to me for a minute.

435
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,040
Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer. He knows who did it.

436
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,930
He may need my help to prove it and I can't help him if I'm in custody.

437
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,970
Then why don't you just tell karen?

438
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,430
Because she won't believe me. Nobody will not without evidence.

439
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,250
It's President Logan.

440
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,450
What are you talking about?

441
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,640
The evidence Jack is trying to get implicates Logan in the assassination of Palmer.

442
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,680
That's ridiculous Chloe.

443
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,960
You know your sexual harassment charges against Miles? I know you were lying.

444
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,800
You're sick and you need help  and if you try to stop me

445
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,390
and it turns out I'm right about Jack  and I am

446
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,230
I will recommend you for a psychiatric evaluation.

447
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,100
And you won't like that trust me.

448
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,580
Charles.You coming to bed soon?

449
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,920
I doubt if I'll get much sleep tonight.

450
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,430
You should try.

451
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,470
-You okay?  -I'm fine.

452
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,620
It's just uh...it's been

453
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,440
a challenging day.

454
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,930
Okay.

455
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,040
Come to bed.

456
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,680
I will. Soon.

457
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,810
yes?

458
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,730
I'm sorry to disturb you Mr. President  but secretary Heller is on the line.

459
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,250
He insists on talking to you.

460
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,140
Tell him I'll call him back tomorrow.

461
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,380
He says it's urgent sir.

462
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,150
Put him through.

463
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,320
Yes James.

464
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,170
Thanks for taking my call Mr. President.

465
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,630
You said it was urgent.

466
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,870
I need to see you sir.

467
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,400
See me about what?

468
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,520
I'd rather speak to you in person.

469
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,860
Fine but I won't be back to washington for a couple of days.

470
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,410
I'm in L.A. Sir.

471
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,290
I need to see you tonight.

472
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,800
Tonight?  What is this about?

473
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,470
I'll be there shortly and we can discuss it then.

474
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,820
I don't like your tone James.

475
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,880
In case you've forgotten you're addressing the President of the United States.

476
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,980
I know who I'm addressing.

477
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,050
And I think you know exactly what this is about.

478
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
When will you be here?

479
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,600
-Five minutes. -Fine.

480
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,760
James Heller?  What does he want?

481
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,550
He's getting flak from the joint chiefs about my decision to maintain martial law.

482
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,050
You would think that these people would show some allegiance.

483
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,400
Can't James handle it himself?

484
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Apparently not.

485
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,220
-Come to bed when you're done. -I will.

486
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,540
Where are you?

487
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
we're leaving now.

488
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,860
-How long will it take you to get there?  -Ten minutes.

489
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,030
We may not have that much time.

490
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,470
James Heller is on his way here. He insisted on seeing me right away.

491
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,040
Jack got to him.

492
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,730
What if Bauer's given him the recording?

493
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,390
Heller's not stupid enough to carry it with him and without it

494
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,510
whatever he knows or whatever he thinks he knows won't matter.

495
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
You think Bauer still has it?

496
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,870
I'm sure of it.

497
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,510
I'll hold Heller off as long as I can

498
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,600
-but you phone me the second you have the evidence in hand. -Right.

499
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,620
Mrs. Logan.

500
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,390
What is secretary Heller doing here?

501
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,300
I don't know ma'am.

502
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,230
But you have an idea.

503
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,570
My husband says it's about his order to maintain martial law

504
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,040
but I think it's something else.

505
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,300
If you know what it is  will you please tell me?

506
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,160
I can't.

507
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,340
You can't? Or you won't?

508
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:54,720
Please don't ask me anything more Mrs. Logan.

509
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,660
Whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us.I promise you.

510
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:12,460
Aaron...you can trust me.You know that.

511
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,500
Not here.

512
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,960
-Meet me in a couple minutes. -Where?

513
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,390
Outside the south stable.

514
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,710
James.

515
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,320
Thank you gentlemen.

516
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,240
I hope this was important.

517
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,080
I know what you did.I know what you're doing.

518
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,440
And I'm here to put an end to it.

519
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,760
You have to be a little more specific.

520
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,990
You are responsible for the murder of David Palmer.

521
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,600
That's outrageous.

522
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,340
I heard a recording

523
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,670
a conversation between you and man named Christopher Henderson.

524
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,110
When Palmer found out about your insane plan Henderson had him killed.

525
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,030
And you let it happen.

526
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,280
Where is this recording?

527
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,390
It's in a safe place.

528
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,260
I would like to hear it.

529
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,110
Why? You know exactly what you said and so do I.

530
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,170
It's burnt into my memory.

531
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,710
How dare you stand there and judge me?

532
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,160
You have no idea.

533
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,810
Until you sit in my chair you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

534
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,730
Your chair is not a throne Charles.

535
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,880
-I'm protecting the interests of our country. -You mean oil.

536
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,920
Yes.Yes!This country needs energy

537
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,620
more than you or anybody in this gridlocked government cares to admit.

538
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,510
We'll see how you judge me when the cost of oil goes up over $100 a barrel

539
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,020
and the people who put me in office can't afford to heat their homes or run their cars.

540
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:11,290
And you think that justifies the blood on your hands?

541
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,190
What do you want?

542
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,480
I want you to drop the trumped-up charges against Jack Bauer.

543
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,710
And leave my daughter alone.

544
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,210
Anything else?

545
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,690
Announce your resignation by tomorrow morning.

546
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,450
Blame it on the crushing stress of today's events or blame it on whatever you want

547
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,380
just as long as you go public by the start of the morning news cycle.

548
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,720
And then what?

549
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,750
The recording will be kept under lock and key

550
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,290
and this will remain between us.

551
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,760
Call in vice President gardner.

552
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,370
I want to be here when you hand him your letter of resignation.

553
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,500
Get in here.

554
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,900
-I haven't been able to contact Jack or Audrey. -I haven't talked to them either.

555
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,180
Ctu might have them in custody.

556
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,820
I need to tap into their current protocols.

557
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,750
-Where's your workstation?  -This way.

558
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,820
Homeland changed my access code.

559
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,020
I can create a workaround.

560
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,880
If ctu has Jack it's all my fault.

561
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,750
I can get us out of here.

562
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,920
Watch the door.

563
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,170
he's got restraints in his pocket. Secure him.

564
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,230
Wexler status report.

565
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,360
Mark come in.

566
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,100
Don't move.

567
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,390
Don't... move.Slowly put the gun on the ground and kick it towards me.

568
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,800
Do it!

569
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,750
Put your hands where I can see them.

570
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,180
Give me the recording.Slowly.

571
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,550
Stand up.

572
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,000
What did you do to my partner?

573
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,980
He's fine.

574
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,400
Son of a bitch!

575
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,250
Take cover behind the wheel! Now! Move!Move!

576
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,360
What the hell's going on? !

577
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,800
They've come for the recording!

578
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,770
If you and I are gonna get through this alive we need to work together.

579
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,220
Give me my gun!

580
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,560
Audrey?

581
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,750
I have her Jack.Now don't make me kill her.

582
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,840
There's been too much killing today already  so just throw out that recording.

583
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,050
Let her go Christopher.

584
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,530
After I have the recording.

585
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,720
Why are you doing this?  Why are you protecting Logan?

586
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm protecting something much more important than Charles Logan.

587
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,730
What?

588
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,540
The integrity of our government.

589
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,760
Our government has no integrity.

590
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,280
Not when someone like Charles Logan occupies the presidency.

591
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,890
Christopher you can make this right. You can help me stop him.

592
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,550
Sorry Jack.Now throw me the recording.

593
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,310
I'll give you the recording if you let Audrey go.

594
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,520
I wish I could believe that.

595
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,890
I give you my word.

596
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,340
I'll tell you what.

597
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,190
I'll meet you Halfway.

598
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,570
What does that mean?

599
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,190
Audrey?

600
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:43,980
Damn you Christopher!

601
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:49,760
Here she comes  Jack.Walk out slow or I'll kill you.

602
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,780
Audrey.

603
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,970
That's far enough Ms. Raines.

604
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,570
What have you done to her?

605
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,350
The left brachial artery.

606
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:14,900
She has about three minutes before she bleeds to death.Now throw me that recording.

607
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,840
Jack don't.

608
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:22,840
She's 15 seconds closer to dying  Jack.Give me the recording.

609
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,180
Jack don't do it.

610
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,760
She's running out of time.

611
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,040
Don't do it Jack.Don't. Don't give it to him.

612
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,020
Here it is!

613
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,920
easy easy easy.Easy. Stay with me.Stay with me.

614
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,900
Jack go get him.Go get him. Go.

615
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,460
Stay with me.

616
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,730
I'll be right back.

617
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,880
Give me your arm.

618
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,670
I need to move you.Come on.

619
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,990
all it needs is your signature  Mr. President.

620
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,050
James we can find another way to handle this.

621
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,110
There must be something I can give you something that you want.

622
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,300
You're giving me exactly what I want.

623
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,410
You asked to see me Mr. President?

624
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,010
Hi jim.

625
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,920
I thought you'd be on a plane back to washington.

626
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,400
What are you doing here?

627
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,490
I'll let President Logan tell you.

628
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,790
Mr. President.

629
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,000
Hal...

630
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,870
Yes.

631
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,350
I have the recording.

632
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,850
Really?

633
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,630
I'll call you back after I've secured a vehicle.

634
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,710
Thank you.

635
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,610
Hal

636
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,830
I'm asking secretary Heller to tender his resignation.I wanted you here as a witness.

637
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,750
What? !

638
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,300
He came here to accuse me of being complicit in today's terrorist attacks.

639
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,190
I don't know how he can make such an accusation without any evidence.

640
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,100
He orchestrated a conspiracy

641
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,750
to let terrorists acquire stolen nerve gas.

642
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,400
That's insane James.

643
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:05,910
He sanctioned the assassination of David Palmer!And I have the evidence.

644
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,440
Where?  Show it to us.

645
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,810
Who was on the phone?  Who made that call?

646
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,720
I want your resignation on my desk by the morning.

647
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,410
-If any harm comes to my daughter... -Gentlemen!

648
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,950
Please escort secretary Heller out of my home.
