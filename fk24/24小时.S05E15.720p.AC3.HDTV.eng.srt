1
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,640
I'm issuing an executive order,

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,390
imposing a curfew on all civilians in the los angeles metropolitan area.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,230
This curfew will be effective immediately and will be enforced by the military.

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,920
They're talking about this like it's an illegal action.

5
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,770
Don't worry,Mr. President.

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,420
I'm in control of the situation.

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,470
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,720
that he proposed this whole thing to set you up for a fall?

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,110
Hal's only motivation is what's best for the country.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,600
There's going to be a fallout.

11
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,920
And you know it.

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,880
You're here to shut this place down, aren't you?

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,070
-I told you before,the white house... -I know what you told me before.

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,260
Now tell me the truth.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,680
CTU is being absorbed by homeland,

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,560
which means from now on,

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,260
every operational decision needs to go through me.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,100
There's something from my brother, I need to give you personally.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,890
I should be there within the hour.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,950
You coming here?

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,010
I know it sounds impulsive,aaron,

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,590
but I'd rather see you sooner than later.

23
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,320
I'm hoping there's somewhere we can meet discreetly.

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,000
does she have the schematics and the access codes?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,100
Yes. Everything we need.

26
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,980
Release the sentox here...

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,500
and 200,000 people die.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,780
The decryption key is charlie-alpha 3-9-alpha.

29
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,120
It worked.

30
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,490
This is what you wanted.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Drop the gun!

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,650
I'm with the german federal intelligence service.

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,570
I've been undercover for the last six months,

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,410
gathering intel on Collette's clientele.

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,630
If we don't find Bierko,

36
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,700
hundreds of thousands of innocent people will die here today.

37
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,960
Let him go!He's given us what we want!

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,120
Put your hands up!

39
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,040
As for the data I sold to Bierko,

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,100
it's something that I received from a contact from the department of defense.

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,060
-What's his name? -Her name?

42
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,280
Audrey Raines.

43
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,680
You were lying to me.

44
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,330
She sold me the information,Mr. Bauer.

45
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,450
Apparently,she had a price.

46
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,820
The following takes place between 9Pm and 10Pm

47
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,510
Chloe,I need you to do something for me right away.

48
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,480
Check out Audrey Raines's activities in the last 18 months.

49
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,370
Audrey? Why?

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,170
I'll explain later.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,640
I'm particularly interested in any unusual connection

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,910
between her and Christopher Henderson or Walt Cummings.

53
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,670
You think she has something to do with their conspiracy?

54
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,630
I don't know what to think.

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,320
Please do it quickly.

56
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,080
Audrey.

57
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,120
Yes?

58
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,860
I'm afraid I have to take you into custody.

59
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,750
What? I don't understand. Am I being arrested?

60
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,660
-Detained. -On what grounds?

61
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,310
Collette Stenger's been passing information to Bierko,

62
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,980
information he apparently intends to use in his next attack.

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,340
She claims she got the information from someone at DOD,

64
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,550
and she named you as the source.

65
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,080
She's lying.That's impossible.

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,860
We already uncovered one mole in the white house today,Audrey.

67
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,180
I have no choice.

68
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,230
What kind of information did Stenger say I gave her?

69
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,380
I've told you as much as I can at this point.

70
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,710
Prep ms. Raines for interrogation.

71
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,140
Does Jack know that I'm being detained?

72
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,290
Yes.He sanctioned it.

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,980
It's the truth.

74
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,320
Audrey Raines was my contact at the department of defense.

75
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,640
You met with her face-to-face?

76
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,320
Yes.

77
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,350
Good,then you'll be able to recognize her when you see her.

78
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,160
Of course.

79
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,730
She identified ms. Raines from photographs on the way here.

80
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,530
If you were lying to me,

81
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,390
I'm gonna make this the worst day of your life.

82
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,450
You understand?

83
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,830
Put her in holding.

84
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,910
Burke's interrogation methods should only be used as a last resort.

85
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,070
The situation warrants a more aggressive approach.

86
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,520
Then do the same thing to Collette Stenger.

87
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,950
Stenger is protected by an immunity agreement.

88
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,890
We can't touch her unless the information she's provided turns out to be false;

89
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,610
then we can nullify the agreement.

90
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,920
So we can torture our own people,

91
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,810
but we can't touch a criminal?

92
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,420
I've known Audrey Raines for years.

93
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,940
I trust her implicitly.

94
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,650
-So does everyone else. -Maybe that's the problem.

95
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,720
Bill,we don't have the luxury of time.

96
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,120
Intel indicates that an attack is imminent

97
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,380
within an hour.

98
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,020
Tens,maybe hundreds of thousands of americans are at risk,

99
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,880
and we just got information that Audrey Raines knows about it.

100
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,890
Karen,the decision is yours.

101
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,510
But any adverse consequences

102
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,100
that result from insufficiently aggressive action taken now

103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,800
will come down hard on you.

104
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,290
What is agent burke doing here?

105
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,760
We're talking about authorizing the medical interrogation.

106
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,080
-On Audrey? -Yes.

107
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,170
That's ridiculous. I'll handle the interrogation.

108
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,950
I can't allow that.

109
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,040
Karen,I brought this to you. I called it in.

110
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,530
You can't pull me off of this now.

111
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,990
Your emotional involvement with ms. Raines is not exactly a secret,Jack.

112
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,430
That has nothing to do with this.

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,650
That's right.

114
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,000
You always put the work first.

115
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,770
You never let your feelings get involved.

116
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,670
Is that what happened with nina myers?

117
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,460
Nina myers was a mistake

118
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,930
I've never denied that

119
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,810
but she was deep cover for years before I even met her.

120
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,500
She fooled a lot of people for a long time,not just me.

121
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,260
Well,maybe Audrey is fooling people,too.

122
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,740
You might be right,karen, but if I were you,

123
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,440
I would think twice about who you're willing to invasively interrogate.

124
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,440
Audrey Raines is the senior advisor to the secretary of defense,james heller,

125
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
who happens to be her father!

126
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,070
And if you were wrong,

127
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,260
he's gonna eat you alive.

128
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,090
At least let Jack talk to her for ten minutes first.

129
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,630
She deserves that much.

130
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,000
If she's guilty...

131
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,850
she doesn't deserve anything.

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,480
That's the point. She hasn't been proven guilty.

133
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,060
After she's been prepped, you can see her for ten minutes.

134
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,580
But at the first sign you're less than objective,you're out.

135
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,540
Understood.

136
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,330
Thanks,Bill.

137
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,100
I don't believe Audrey is guilty of anything,Jack.

138
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,870
Neither do I.

139
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,970
The one thing we do know is,

140
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,340
Bierko is going to release the sentox in the city sometime in the next hour.

141
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,170
If Audrey knows anything that can help us find him,

142
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,160
she needs to tell us now.

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,460
Keep an eye on the traffic patrol.

144
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,170
Bierko's gonna need to move those canisters.

145
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,620
He's gonna need transportation.

146
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,450
With the curfew in place, I might get lucky and pick up a trail.

147
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,680
Yeah.

148
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,510
hey,break it up!

149
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,750
Break it up now!

150
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,680
Gentlemen,I said,break it up!

151
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,240
take their uniforms and weapons.

152
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,570
Now we have a police escort to the target,

153
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,640
the curfew won't be a problem.

154
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,630
Chloe,walk with me.

155
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,460
You were doing background on Audrey?

156
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,300
Yeah.

157
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,670
What have you got?

158
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,680
You're not going to like it.

159
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,090
I found the connection between Walt Cummings and Audrey.

160
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
What kind of a connection?

161
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,430
They dealt with each other a few times

162
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,820
the usual stuff between DOD and the white house.

163
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,610
But there is something else.

164
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,070
What?

165
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,790
Chloe,what?

166
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,350
They both stayed at a place called

167
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,310
the river hotel in Pikesville,maryland,last april.

168
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,130
So?

169
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,770
So,Pikesville isn't exactly a hot spot with top-ranking federal officials.

170
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,730
It wasn't a coincidence that they were there the same night.

171
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,140
Chloe,what are you trying to say?

172
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,130
They didn't just stay in the same hotel,

173
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,790
but they stayed in the same room.

174
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,210
How could you possibly know that?

175
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,680
Because I e-mailed photos of them to the manager.

176
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,070
He recognized them both.

177
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,600
He showed me phone Bills,

178
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,670
room service receipts.

179
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,320
I can show you a few if you want.

180
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,050
No. I'm sorry.

181
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,780
I believe you.

182
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,730
It doesn't mean she was part of their conspiracy,

183
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,560
but it doesn't exactly look that good either.

184
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,950
Make copies of everything you've got and put them in a folder for me.

185
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,580
-I will. -Thanks.

186
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,940
Excuse me.

187
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,840
My name is Shari Rothenberg.

188
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,350
I work in section five downstairs.

189
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,500
I know where section five is.

190
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,860
Right. Uh,Mr. Buchanan told me to report to Chloe O'brian.

191
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,190
-Is that you? -You're gonna have to wait a second.

192
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,070
Um,I'm here to replace edgar.

193
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,720
I understand he died in the attack.

194
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,780
Yes,he did.

195
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,650
Well,if he was a friend of yours,I'm sorry.

196
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,820
Thanks.

197
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,250
He worked at station six.

198
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,890
It's right there.

199
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,760
Are you familiar with the gavilan matrix analyzer?

200
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,540
Yes,I am.

201
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,620
Use it to make sure our databases are current.

202
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,240
Some of them may have fallen behind in the past couple of hours.

203
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,610
No problem.

204
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,640
Jack.

205
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,250
Sit down.

206
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,540
Sit down.

207
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,330
That's the dossier you gave me on Collette Stenger.

208
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,660
No.

209
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,450
She says that you provided her with information from the DOD.

210
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,160
I know. Bill told me.That's ridiculous.

211
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,850
You know it.

212
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,290
Jack,you're wasting time that we don't have.

213
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,690
I had to ask ctu so that I could interrogate you.

214
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,820
I have a job to do.

215
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,520
If I don't do it,burke will, and I promise you,

216
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,690
you do not want to see him walk through that door.

217
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,260
Fine.What kind of information did she say I gave her?

218
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,610
She said you provided her with a structural schematic of Bierko's next target.

219
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,920
What kind of structure?

220
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,780
She didn't know. She just delivered the package.

221
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,840
She claims that I gave her information,

222
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,720
yet she can't tell you what that information is,

223
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,250
and that's enough to make me a suspect?!

224
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,800
Damn it,Audrey! You know what this nerve gas does?

225
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,730
They are planning another attack.

226
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,520
We will not ignore any leads.

227
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,040
I have nothing to do with these terrorists.

228
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,470
How did Collette Stenger get your name?

229
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,990
I don't know.

230
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,490
My father is the secretary of defense. I'm an easy target.

231
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,800
Maybe she's trying to use him or embarrass him.

232
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,760
Is he involved?

233
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,980
Oh,Jack, you know him better than that.

234
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,360
You worked with him.

235
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,510
He would never do anything outside the law,

236
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,620
and neither would I.

237
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,960
The two men that we know are part of the conspiracy

238
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,510
are Walt Cummings and Christopher Henderson.

239
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,430
Have you had any contact with these men?

240
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,330
Christopher Henderson. I have never heard...

241
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,240
I'd never heard of him before today and,um...

242
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,640
Walt Cummings I-I have met a couple of times,yes.

243
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,730
Where?

244
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,310
Um,DOD briefings.

245
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,360
That's it?

246
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,620
Yes.

247
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,560
Are you sure? Yes,I'm sure.

248
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,670
Open it.

249
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,150
The river hotel,Pikesville,last april.

250
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,760
Yeah,I'm sorry.

251
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,460
Um... we happened to be there at the same time.

252
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,920
We may have had a drink or two together.

253
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,800
You weren't having drinks with him. You shared a room with him.

254
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,680
You slept with him.

255
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,940
Yes.

256
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,450
I was still recovering from losing you,Jack.

257
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,170
He,uh...

258
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,450
he had just separated from his wife,

259
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,710
and I slept with him once and then I broke it off.

260
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,690
Why'd you break it off?

261
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,130
Jack,please,it's complicated.

262
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,760
Why did you break it off?!

263
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,630
Because he wasn't you.

264
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,690
Why did you lie to me when I asked you the first time?

265
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,110
'Cause I,I was...

266
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,030
I was afraid that you'd think less of me,

267
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,150
that you wouldn't be able to forgive me.

268
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,280
Because you slept with someone after you thought I was dead?

269
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:51,260
Because I slept with someone who turned out to be a traitor,Jack.

270
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,290
Is that the only time you spent with Cummings?

271
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,010
Yes.

272
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,510
Did he ever talk to you about a terrorist attack,nerve gas?

273
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:04,960
No.

274
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,540
He ever mention Christopher Henderson?

275
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,500
No.

276
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,830
Damn it,Audrey!

277
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,850
Jack,I... Jack! Tell me the truth!

278
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,810
I am telling you the T...

279
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,580
you've already lied to me once.

280
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,100
You tell me what you know,or I promise you this will become very unpleasant.

281
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm telling you everything.

282
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,250
Do what you have to do.

283
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,000
Damn it,Audrey.Tell me the truth!

284
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,520
Jack. I am telling you the truth,I swear.

285
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,230
This is over!

286
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,880
You understand? This is over!

287
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,940
If you ask me, she broke him and not the other way around.

288
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,440
Karen.

289
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,280
He didn't push her hard enough, and you know it.

290
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,420
-He's protecting her. -She's innocent.

291
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,940
-We have to be certain. -I am certain.

292
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,370
Jack is certain.

293
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,930
Well,I'm not.

294
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,810
Karen.

295
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,300
Send burke in.

296
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,270
I have to do this,Bill.

297
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,650
I can't waste any more time, and make sure that Jack doesn't interfere.

298
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,810
Okay,I'll pass that on.

299
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,630
Shari. That was the agent at Bierko's safe house.

300
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,570
The place is empty.

301
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,510
Forensics is still looking, but they don't expect to find much.

302
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,350
Upload that information onto the subnets.

303
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,270
Oh. Right.

304
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,680
I checked your file.

305
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,600
You're not qualified for level three work,

306
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,000
and that is a level three.

307
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,750
I'm provisionally qualified.

308
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,980
It's all in my supplemental file.

309
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,600
Go ahead and check it if you want.

310
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,370
All right,Shari.

311
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,490
First mistake,I yank the provisional and you're out of here.

312
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,780
What's with him?

313
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,120
Two years ago we both worked in the San Francisco office.

314
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,860
There was a sexual harassment thing.

315
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,150
Miles?

316
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,260
It was subtle at first, and then it got really bad.

317
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,170
Finally filed a grievance.

318
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,480
What happened?

319
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,780
He got off with a warning.

320
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,410
These things are really hard to prove.

321
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,500
They said we didn't have enough evidence to go to trial.

322
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,310
I can't get into any details. The file is sealed.

323
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,150
Don't worry. I don't need details.

324
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,660
But I guess I'd better not make any mistakes.

325
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,340
Yeah.

326
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,160
What's going on?

327
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,700
I'm sorry. This is out of my control.

328
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,180
Karen wants to push Audrey a little harder.

329
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,090
No,her interrogation is over.

330
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,370
Jack,I'll try to stall her as long as I can.

331
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,550
Jack,I have orders to take miss Raines to holding for further interrogation.

332
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,660
I don't care about your orders.

333
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,860
That's not gonna happen.

334
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,400
Get out of my way.

335
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,830
Get out of my way.

336
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,480
Jack,don't make this any harder than it is.

337
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,380
Bill,do something!

338
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,770
let go off me

339
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,830
Bill!let them stop

340
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,300
Bill

341
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,930
Bill

342
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,010
Hello.

343
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,830
Mr. Henderson,it's Brennan.

344
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,560
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

345
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,350
No.

346
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,390
Explain.

347
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,210
We rolled his car, but he survived and got away.

348
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,800
It was sloppy work. We'll make it right.

349
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,280
Well,you damn well better.

350
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,860
You know what's at stake.

351
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,080
Yes,sir.

352
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,010
This is Wayne Palmer.

353
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,970
At the tone,leave a message.

354
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,490
Steve,has Wayne Palmer come through a checkpoint within the last half hour?

355
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,570
Yeah,he was cleared through checkpoint 6 30 minutes ago.

356
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,400
What,he's not here yet?

357
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,990
No,he's not, and I can't reach him on his cell.

358
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,410
If you're worried, i can send out an alert.

359
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,640
No.

360
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,050
Actually,he kind of wanted to keep his visit under the radar.

361
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,740
I think I'm going to go out there and take a look myself,

362
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,860
in case he had car trouble or something.

363
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,230
Do me a favor.

364
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,950
Keep this between us,would you?

365
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,200
Yes,sir.

366
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,340
Thanks.

367
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,310
Thanks.

368
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,310
You need to calm down,Jack,

369
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,490
and remember who's in charge.

370
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,810
Audrey Raines is innocent.

371
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,830
She slept with a known conspirator and lied about it.

372
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,980
That doesn't concern you?

373
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,000
She slept with him once and lied about it because she was embarrassed.

374
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,090
That hardly makes her part of this conspiracy.

375
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,320
Why did Collette Stenger name her as the source?

376
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,870
She must have gotten Audrey's name from Henderson.

377
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,480
Why would Henderson want to implicate Audrey?

378
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,560
Henderson doesn't want to implicate Audrey.

379
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,410
He's coming after me.

380
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,740
He's trying to make me lose focus.

381
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,250
And he's trying to pull you off target.

382
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,350
And he's done it.

383
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,100
These plans must have been made some time ago,

384
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,890
when Henderson had every reason to believe you were gonna be killed.

385
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,980
Karen,listen to me.

386
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,210
This is what I do for a living.

387
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,070
And the first rule of engagement is that you have a contingency plan.

388
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,180
And this is his,and it's working.

389
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,470
You're getting ready to interrogate Audrey Raines

390
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,150
when you should be interrogating Collette Stenger,

391
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,420
because she still has information that we don't have!

392
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,940
Stenger has immunity.

393
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,730
She's being protected by a federal marshal.

394
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,890
That's your doing,Jack. You made that deal!

395
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,210
I know.

396
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,310
But if I can prove that Collette Stenger is withholding information from us,

397
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,830
that act alone negates her deal.

398
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,250
I'll be able to start questioning her again.

399
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,670
She will give me Henderson.

400
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,750
And once I have Henderson, he will lead us to the nerve gas,

401
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,190
and that's what we're supposed to be focused on!

402
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,300
What are you suggesting we do,Jack?

403
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:50,430
Let me and Chloe find proof that Collette Stenger is lying to us.

404
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,150
If we don't,you lose nothing.

405
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,150
But if we do,we can stop this thing from happening,

406
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,340
I promise you.

407
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,030
Karen,please.

408
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,000
Excuse me.

409
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,040
These matrix sweeps are partials only.

410
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,990
Where's the rest of the data?

411
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,600
I thought matrix data could be sent unfiltered.

412
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,190
That's not protocol.

413
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,270
-I thought it was all right in house. -Only if it's authorized.

414
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,720
-Who authorized it? -I did.

415
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,320
She did it under my authority. I take full responsibility.

416
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,140
I don't believe you.

417
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,490
Believe what you want.

418
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,460
That would be sloppy,O'brian.

419
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,330
You don't work like that.

420
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,200
She told you about my alleged sexual harassment,right?

421
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,030
Well,she's lying.Listen...

422
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,130
No,you listen.

423
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,200
There are 17 canisters of nerve gas about to be

424
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,880
deployed somewhere in los angeles, and we're trying to find them.

425
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,550
If you interrupt our work one more time, I'll file a complaint with division.

426
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,660
Then you'll see what protocol's all about.

427
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,470
-Thank you. -You are welcome.

428
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,060
Chloe,we need to help Audrey. We don't have much time.

429
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,050
How?

430
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,590
We need to find the connection between Collette Stenger and Henderson.

431
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,620
We found Collette's name on Henderson's computer.

432
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,690
It's not enough.

433
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,660
We need proof that they had direct contact, preferably more than once.

434
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,280
You think Henderson gave Collette Audrey's name?

435
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,070
I'm sure of it.

436
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,310
I want you to use outside agencies,including foreign.

437
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,970
Put it on a priority channel.

438
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm on it.

439
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,830
We have an important delivery.

440
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,000
There's no delivery scheduled.

441
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm gonna need to call this in.

442
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,340
stay out here and watch the perimeter.

443
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,810
Who's in charge?

444
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,460
I am.

445
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,220
We need access to the control room. Can you take us there?

446
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,120
What are you guys doing here?

447
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,180
Can you take us to the control room?

448
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,690
Yeah. It's that way.

449
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,940
Good.

450
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,670
Keep cooperating and no more of your friends will die.

451
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,120
-Do you understand? -Yes.

452
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,760
Mikhail,take the canisters to the main distribution tank.

453
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,110
-Quickly! -Go

454
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,670
This is it.

455
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,450
Sam,what's going on?

456
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,110
Ah,sam...

457
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,990
I'm not an engineer, but I know enough,

458
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,290
so you'd be wise not to try to deceive me.

459
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,210
What we're doing here is very simple.

460
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,650
We're going to release a certain substance so that it flows into your pipelines.

461
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,080
What kind of substance?

462
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,090
That's not your concern.

463
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,780
But at the pressure which currently prevails in these pipes,

464
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,850
the substance will react chemically with the gas and become inert.

465
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,860
So I need the pressure reduced by about 50%.

466
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,230
Sam,don't do it.

467
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,360
Do you understand what I want?

468
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,940
You want psi cut by half.

469
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,690
Exactly.

470
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,920
And how long will it take?

471
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,710
Could take an hour.

472
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,140
You don't seem to care very much for your friends,do you,sam?

473
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,110
No,no,don't!

474
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,280
I might be able to do it in 30 minutes.

475
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,900
You have 15.

476
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,170
Better get started.

477
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,820
Don't move!

478
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,730
Drop the gun.Now!

479
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,230
Move away from it.

480
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,130
Now get on your knees.

481
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,070
Mr. Palmer.

482
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,650
It's aaron.

483
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,960
Oh,god.

484
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,720
Aaron,what are you doing out here?

485
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,840
I was looking for you,sir.

486
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,730
So are some other people.Let's go.

487
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,990
Ms. Raines, we know you conspired with Mr. Cummings.

488
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,350
I didn't.

489
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,780
Who else in the white house was involved?

490
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,000
I don't know.

491
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,530
You know,ms. Raines.

492
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't have... have any names.

493
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,150
You're gonna give me a name...

494
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,330
I swear I don't know,I...

495
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,460
We don't have the time,ms. Raines.

496
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,970
Give me a name!

497
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,960
I don'T... I swear.I don't know.

498
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,630
Chloe,what have you got?

499
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,690
I found some masked entries in Collette Stenger's cell phone.

500
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,740
-The decryption program... -come on,Chloe.

501
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,650
Henderson placed eight cell phone calls to

502
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,500
Collette Stenger within the past three months.

503
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,720
Where's Collette Stenger now?

504
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,390
Holding room 3.

505
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,300
Bill,we have a connection between Henderson and Collette stinger.

506
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,360
She received eight calls from him that she didn't tell us about.

507
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,890
That voids her agreement.It's off.

508
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,120
That's for the president to decide.

509
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,110
Call the president!

510
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,080
You need a rescinding order to question her,Jack.

511
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,570
Get him to back off of Audrey!

512
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,080
Get me the president.

513
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,820
What's your connection with Christopher Henderson?

514
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,660
I have an immunity agreement signed by your president.

515
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,110
She's right. She can't be questioned.

516
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,700
We have proof that she withheld information.

517
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,630
Her deal's been rescinded. The order's on its way.

518
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,750
When it gets here, she's all yours.

519
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,270
An innocent woman is being interrogated because of her.

520
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,770
Look,I'm sorry,sir, but you have to go.

521
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,850
We know you lied to us.

522
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,850
We know that you did not get the schematics from Audrey Raines.

523
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,250
Henderson told you to use her name in case you got in trouble,right?

524
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,470
You do not want to try me.

525
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,010
Yes.

526
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,880
He tell you why?

527
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,060
No.

528
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
He's using you.

529
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,740
He wanted you to get inside my head.

530
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,330
It worked.

531
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,060
Now I'M...

532
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,740
upset.

533
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,280
You have three seconds to tell me where the target is,or I will kill you.

534
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,250
Where's the target?!

535
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,780
A natural gas distribution center.

536
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,000
There are dozens of those in the city. Which one?

537
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,620
I don't know.

538
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,540
I swear.

539
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,760
I don't know.I don't.

540
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,720
Jack,what's going on?

541
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,020
Bierko's targeting a natural gas distribution center,but we don't know which one.

542
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,030
Natural gas?

543
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,550
He can use it as a delivery system for the sentox. He can get it into people's homes.

544
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,900
I need you to get Chloe on it. We need to find out which one.

545
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,140
Right. The rescinding order will be here in 15 minutes.

546
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,010
Good. Give it to the marshal.

547
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,900
He'll be looking for this,too.

548
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,040
Please,no more. I'm begging you.

549
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,480
Please. Don't dothat. Please...

550
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,820
please. I'm telling you the truth.

551
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,770
You're bringing this on yourself.

552
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,160
No!

553
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,290
Stop it!

554
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,710
-this can end whenever you want it to... -Make him...

555
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,060
-let her go! -Shut it down now!

556
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,180
You are finished in here. She is innocent.

557
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,130
You can confirm it with Buchanan.

558
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,480
I said you're finished. Get out!

559
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,990
-Audrey,are you all right? -I don't know.

560
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,040
It's over.

561
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,020
I promise you,it's over for good.

562
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,620
My god,what's happening to me? What's happening?

563
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,240
Henderson set you up...

564
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,580
to get at me, to throw me off his trail.

565
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,480
Come here.

566
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm so sorry.

567
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,780
Jack,the only thing that got me through this...

568
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,180
was knowing that you would come.

569
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,370
I knew you would come.

570
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm so sorry.

571
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,500
-Bauer. -Jack,it's Bill.

572
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,940
Chloe has got sone information, we need you getting on the floor.

573
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,530
Go.

574
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,420
Jack?

575
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,210
I'll be right there.

576
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,550
Bill,I want you to send someone over from medical to interrogation

577
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,500
to tend to Audrey Raines.

578
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,780
Okay.

579
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,820
Thanks.

580
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,880
Gonna be all right?

581
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,260
Go. It's okay.

582
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,150
Our satellite covers only 60% of the distribution centers.

583
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,790
If our target's not in that grouping, we're out of luck.

584
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,270
Can we redirect any other satellite?

585
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,120
I'm trying.

586
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,120
Did you identify the distribution center that they're gonna hit?

587
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,830
We're pulling in more satellites.

588
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,020
Our analysts tell us once the sentox hits the main tank,

589
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,900
it goes right into the pipes, where it becomes impossible to stop.

590
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,620
From there, it goes straight into people's homes.

591
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,130
How many casualties are we talking about?

592
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,700
The largest centers serve 90,000 people. We could have twice that many casualties.

593
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,600
If our intel is correct, we have 15 minutes.

594
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,420
Okay,I'll prep a team with curtis. We'll go airborne.

595
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,990
We'll be ready as soon as you id a target.

596
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,870
Mr. Buchanan?

597
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,350
There may be a faster way.

598
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,380
I was a chem major at cal tech.

599
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,610
Most toxins become inert under high pressure.

600
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,160
The psi would have to be lowered before the nerve gas was introduced.

601
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,900
Chloe,can you monitor the pressure levels at the distribution centers?

602
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,850
Yeah. I have citywide readings of them all.Hold on.

603
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,590
Wilshire gas company.

604
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,650
The psi has dropped to 75% in the past ten minutes.

605
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,240
We have to assume that's it. I'll tell Jack.

606
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,840
Great work,sherry.

607
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,490
Congratulations.

608
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,300
Thanks.

609
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,730
Did you see the way his hand

610
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,940
brushed across my shoulder as he walked by?

611
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,310
What?

612
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,230
That was wrong.

613
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,170
He shouldn't have done that.

614
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,620
What is it?

615
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,240
Get down!

616
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,670
Get in the car!

617
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,850
Chloe,what's the psi level?

618
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,930
Psi level is down to 57%.

619
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,350
Another seven is all they need to deploy the sentox.

620
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,820
How long will that take?

621
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,670
Four,maybe five minutes.

622
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,040
Jack,the psi level can only be adjusted from the main control room.

623
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,360
It's the large building in the center of the complex two floors down from the roof.

624
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,450
Copy that.

625
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,440
Okay,we'll insert here.

626
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,160
We'll advance to the control room,

627
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,970
locate and secure the canisters.

628
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,370
We're almost there.

629
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,260
The noise from the plant should cover our descent.

630
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,680
We're ready.

631
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,420
Good.

632
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,990
Get back here.

633
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,170
How much longer?

634
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
A few more minutes.

635
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,120
I can't lower the pressure any faster without risking a shutdown.

636
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,320
Chloe,it's Jack. Do you have any heat signatures?

637
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,550
Yes,but I can only scan from the exterior of the site.

638
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,450
There are two guards patrolling the perimeter.

639
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,980
I've given the pilot an approach vector

640
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,550
to keep you from their line of sight.

641
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,000
Maintain this position!

642
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,450
Go!

643
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,410
CTU,

644
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,760
the team's away.

645
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,050
They're on the roof.

646
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,040
The psi level is down to 54%.

647
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,970
CTU,we're inside.

648
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,600
Jack,Bierko will be ready to deploy any minute.

649
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,830
Copy that.

650
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,560
silencers off.

651
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,670
Bierko!

652
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,720
Keep moving! Cover me!

653
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,860
Curtis, the sentox is already in the system.

654
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,150
Who's in charge here?!

655
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:06,730
Listen to me.

656
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,920
You have sentox nerve gas running through your pipeline.

657
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,820
Can you shut down the pumps?

658
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,810
By the time we power down,

659
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,090
gas will be in the main tanks,

660
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:12,950
then it's out into the city.

661
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,920
Where's the closest pipeline that feeds those tanks?

662
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,630
Just out the door to your left.

663
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,480
It'll have a red arrow on it.

664
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,450
Give me the c4 and a timer,

665
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,870
then get these people out of here.

666
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,870
Jack,what are you doing?

667
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,660
In order to deliver the sentox,

668
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,400
it had to mix with natural gas.

669
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,250
If we could ignite that gas before it leaves the plant,

670
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,380
the sentox will be incinerated.

671
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,170
Bill,this is the last chance we've got to stop this threat.

672
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,160
The sentox has been in the system for one minute.

673
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,080
You have 50 seconds before it gets out.

674
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,280
Charge has been set.

675
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,640
Curtis,are you clear?

676
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,930
Just about.

677
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,140
Keep going.

678
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,890
Jack,are you clear?

679
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,520
Jack?

680
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,430
Jack,respond.

681
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,620
Come on,Jack.

682
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,330
Jack,you okay?

683
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,760
Curtis,I got a visual on Bierko.

684
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,670
Jack,you won't have time before the main tank explodes.

685
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,600
Right now he's our only connection to Henderson.

686
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,670
Jack!

687
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,740
Bill,he's going in.

688
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,180
Bierko!

689
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,140
Jack,that's it. The main tanks are going.

690
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,270
Get out!
