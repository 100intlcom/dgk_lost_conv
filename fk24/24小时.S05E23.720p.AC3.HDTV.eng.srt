1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,510
You're a traitor to this country and a disgrace to your office.

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,240
Logan wants me dead because he thinks I know too much.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,780
Logan had more to protect,and you know that.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,320
-Aaron? -Ma'am,please stay where you are.

5
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,850
-Bierko's escaped. -What?

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,230
How long ago?

7
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,700
Davis,Karen Hayes here. What happened?

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,980
Our lead car got taken out by an IED.

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,080
I overheard Bierko talking to his men. He said they're not finished.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,790
I'm sure he said something about a nerve gas canister.

11
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,580
Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas to begin with.

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,740
Trust me. You're wasting your time. He's not going to help us.

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,740
He will if we offer him a deal.

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,570
What do you want?

15
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,140
I'll disappear just like you did so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,510
Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate,

17
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,840
this deal is off.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Bierko's going to release the Sentox gas soon. We need to know where.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,060
It's a Russian submarine,Jack.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,980
What is the armament package on a Russian Delta-4 class sub?

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,690
Best of my knowledge, 12 Scorpion land-attack missiles.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,760
They're fast and accurate,carry multiple warheads.

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,830
One of them can take out several city blocks.

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,340
Lieutenant,we believe the Natalia has been targeted for a terrorist attack.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,910
We think the terrorists are after your missiles on the sub.

26
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,500
You need to secure your vessel and lock down your weapons system immediately.

27
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,640
That way.

28
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,330
We have control of the weapons system.

29
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,260
The following takes place between 5Am and 6Am.

30
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,640
I've flushed the Sentox. The atmospheric readings are all normal.

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,410
It's safe to breathe.

32
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,620
The coordinates for the targets upload them into the missiles.

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,920
Begin the launch countdown.

34
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,030
Remove your masks.

35
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,120
We are close to finishing what we started today.

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,570
I have identified 12 high-value targets:

37
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,590
financial centers,transportation hubs, high-population-density areas.

38
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,140
The Americans will wake up this morning to discover

39
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,270
how steep a price they've paid for their alliance with Moscow.

40
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,760
What we're about to accomplish today

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,100
will be remembered by our countrymen forever.

42
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,450
-Ms. Raines. -Admiral Kirkland.

43
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,170
I understand you're reporting some type of emergency at the Port of Los Angeles?

44
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,510
In anticipation of today's treaty with the Russians,

45
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,180
the Russian submarine Natalia is docked here for inspection by the U.S. Navy.

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,890
I'm familiar with the exercise. I authorized it myself.

47
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,960
Terrorists have seized control of that submarine.

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,190
What? We haven't received any distress signals from the crew.

49
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,610
Because they're dead,sir,all of them, including the Russian crew.

50
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,910
We believe the terrorists have flooded the sub's ventilation system with Sentox nerve gas.

51
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,680
My God.

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,020
Sir,I don't mean to preempt your protocols,

53
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,360
but how long will it take you to scramble a flight of F-18s?

54
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,220
You're asking me to sink the submarine?

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,620
Sir,these terrorists are in control of 12 multiple-warhead missiles,

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,690
which they will use against civilian targets unless we stop them first.

57
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,670
I'll need all of this confirmed.

58
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,970
We have a team on the ground that can confirm, but now I need to know precisely:

59
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,250
How long will it take for you to scramble these fighters?

60
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,830
I'm sending you the estimated approach vectors and ETA for my F-18s.

61
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,270
I can have my fighter jets there within 22 to 25 minutes.

62
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,560
We have a problem,sir.

63
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,160
According to our simulation,Bierko will have his missiles in the air in less than 20 minutes.

64
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,050
Scrambling the jets right now,

65
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,230
but it seems to me as if this is going to be up to your team on the ground.

66
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,390
We have visual contact with the sub.

67
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,620
Hatches are still closed. Ship's been locked down.

68
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,480
Confirming one hostile topside, standing guard.

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,520
Jack,Chloe's simulation has Bierko firing those missiles in less than 20 minutes.

70
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,610
Sooner than that if he's already started programming targets.

71
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,040
The Navy won't be able to intercept in time.

72
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,970
Jack,it's Audrey. I just got off the phone with Admiral Kirkland.

73
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,140
He's scrambling F-18s,but they won't be able to

74
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,310
get them in the air in time in order to destroy the sub.

75
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,910
-How far out are reinforcements? -Too far.

76
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,880
Additional tac teams won't arrive until after the missiles have launched.

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,110
That means we have to take Bierko down ourselves.

78
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,790
That's not a real option,Jack. There are only four entry points on that submarine.

79
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,890
We have to assume that Bierko's locked them down and is defending them.

80
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,290
Jack,Bill's right.We don't have the manpower or the resources to get on that sub.

81
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,580
We might. Somebody just launched a signal tube off the starboard side.

82
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,990
What's a signal tube?

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,280
It's a radio beacon crewmen can send to the surface in case of emergencies.

84
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,420
Chloe,if there are friendlies inside, they can help us board the sub.

85
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,150
-I want you to scan all emergency frequencies. -On it.

86
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,460
Standing by.

87
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,720
Jack,just so we're straight

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,960
we stop Bierko,my wife and I disappear for good,with your help,right?

89
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,260
-Yeah. -One other thing.

90
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,040
If I'm going on that sub with you, I need a firearm.

91
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,040
I'll cover you.

92
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,850
Well,that's what I'm worried about.

93
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,290
I don't go anywhere undefended against hostiles.

94
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,980
I still consider you a hostile.

95
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,150
Jack,I don't get a gun,I don't go in.

96
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,760
Jack,you were right. There's a survivor on the submarine. He's sending out a distress signal.

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,690
-Can he receive on this frequency? -Yeah.

98
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,520
Patch him through.

99
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,710
I repeat. Petty Officer Tim Rooney,on Natalia K524.

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,510
Code seven. SOS. We are under attack.

101
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,660
Petty Officer Rooney,my name is Jack Bauer.

102
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,150
I'm with the Counterterrorist Unit,Los Angeles.

103
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,840
What the hell is going on,sir? Everyone's dead.

104
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,120
And there are people in the Control Room trying to operate the missile launch system.

105
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,270
-Who the hell are they? -They're Russian separatists.

106
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,330
They're the terrorists that were responsible for the attacks that took place earlier today.

107
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,770
Does the Navy know about this?

108
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,880
Yeah. They're sending in fighters,but I don't think they're going to get here in time.

109
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,640
So what are we supposed to do?

110
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,650
Did anyone else from your crew survive the attack?

111
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,800
No. I don't think so.

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,310
Where are you?

113
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,040
Lower Level,Auxiliary Engineering.

114
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,400
I was down here doing an inventory when the alarms went off.

115
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,880
The atmospheric gauges red-lined. It's a sealed compartment,so I shut it down.

116
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,100
The n that attacked the ship, were they wearing gas masks?

117
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,580
They were,but they took them off a few minutes ago.

118
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,670
Okay,good. That means they flushed the Sentox out of the air system.

119
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,970
You should be able to move around freely. Hold on one second.

120
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,550
-Chloe? -Yes,Jack?

121
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,440
I want you to get me the nearest

122
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,330
entry point to Petty Officer Rooney's current position.

123
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,090
The closest hatch is the forward escape hatch.

124
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,430
Copy that.

125
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,320
Petty Officer Rooney, do you have a firearm?

126
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,160
No. The armory's on the other side of the ship.

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,710
You need to find something that you can use as a weapon.

128
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,440
I have a... I have a utility tool. It has a knife on it.

129
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,350
That'll work. I want you to make your way up to the Upper Level.

130
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,260
Let me know when you get there.

131
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,700
You still haven't told me what it is you want me to do.

132
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,820
I need you to get to the forward escape hatch and let us in.

133
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,180
There's a man there guarding it.

134
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,800
Then you're going to have to kill him.

135
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,840
Petty Officer Rooney?

136
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,090
I'm an engineer.

137
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,550
I... I'm not trained for that.

138
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,980
The men that commandeered the Natalia plan to use its missiles

139
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,420
and launch them on civilian targets unless we stop them.

140
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,610
You need to make your way up to the Upper Level.

141
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,810
You need to do it now. We are running out of time.

142
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,790
-I'll contact you when I get there. -Copy that.

143
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,710
We need to get closer to the sub. Are you ready?

144
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,450
Jack,I know you got Malina's. 45 in that bag.Now,give it to me.

145
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,740
Let's go.

146
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,880
We're generating a list of potential targets,

147
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,100
but frankly,we have no idea what Bierko plans to hit.

148
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,080
Are we evacuating these potential targets?

149
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,740
Don't have time. The missiles will strike before we can

150
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,400
mobilize even small numbers of people to the safe zones.

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,390
How could this happen,Mike?

152
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,390
How could these people even access a submarine in the first place?

153
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,240
The sub was attacked when it was being serviced at a civilian port,

154
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,240
not on a Naval base where security would have been more substantial.

155
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,640
There has to be a way to destroy that sub before Bierko can launch those missiles.

156
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,450
F-18s are scrambling as we speak.

157
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,640
According to the latest estimates,

158
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,300
they're not going to get there in time.

159
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,730
Yes?

160
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,050
I'm still waiting to talk to Mike Novick.

161
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,240
He's in some kind of crisis meeting. There's no telling how long he'll be.

162
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,010
Then I should try to get off the ranch on my own.

163
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,010
No. Without Mike's help,you'll be seen. Charles can't find out you're still alive.

164
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,270
-I'll call you as soon as I get ahold of Mike. -Okay.

165
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,460
Jack,the missiles will launch in less than ten minutes.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
Copy that.

167
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,040
How much time do you need to cancel the launch sequence?

168
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,390
I won't know for certain until I see how the targeting software is configured.

169
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,940
Jack,the Petty Officer is coming back on.

170
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,070
Patch him through.

171
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,590
Petty Officer Rooney, you're on with Jack Bauer.

172
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,450
What's your position,son?

173
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,820
I'm 30 feet forward of the hatch.

174
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,570
Have you got a visual of the hostile guarding the hatch?

175
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,020
Yeah. He's still there.

176
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,060
What do you want me to do?

177
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,760
You need to kill him without alerting the others.

178
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,480
Are you right-handed or left-handed?

179
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,110
-I'm right-handed. -I want you to approach him from behind.

180
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,140
When you're within 18 inches,I want you to take your left hand,

181
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,180
put it on his mouth,pull his head backinto your chest exposing his neck.

182
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,650
Then I want you to take your right hand and slit his throat.

183
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,400
I... I don't,uh... I don't know if I can do this.

184
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,200
You don't have a choice,son.

185
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,200
You need to focus on the objective.

186
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,920
You cannot afford to think about this,son. You need to do it.

187
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,330
Jack,there's less than six minutes until the missile launch.

188
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,640
Petty Officer Rooney?

189
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,410
Petty Officer Rooney?

190
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,930
Okay,I can do this.

191
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,760
I have to do this.

192
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,620
Cut him deep,and cut him fast.

193
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,480
Agent McCullough,cover us. We're moving in on the tower.

194
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,060
-Yes.sir. -Go.

195
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,570
Petty Officer Rooney,wh is your status?

196
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,310
My status is,uh... He's dead.

197
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,410
Did anyone hear you?

198
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,080
-No,no one's coming. -Good. Open the hatch.

199
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,630
-You ready? -Yeah.

200
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,540
I'll take out the guard. Let's go.

201
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,750
Guard is down, we are going in.

202
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,520
Oh,no. The sub's missile hatches just opened.

203
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,640
I see them.What does that mean in terms of our time frame?

204
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,800
You have less than four minutes until they launch.

205
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,950
-Are you all right? -I'm okay.

206
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,900
-Which way is the control room? -It's down that hall.

207
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,930
-You lead,we'll follow. -Okay.

208
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,280
All right,the control room's right down that hall.

209
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,240
I'm going to need your help drawing the rest of the hostiles out of the con.

210
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,840
What do you want me to do?

211
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,640
Is there another way for you to get to the other side of the control room?

212
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,610
Yeah,I can go down one level and then come up behind them.

213
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,100
Okay,when you get there,I want you to create a diversion,

214
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,590
something loud.Just make sure you get them out of there.

215
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,590
When you do,I want you to find somewhere to lay low

216
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,600
and stay there.I do not want you to engage them.

217
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,440
-Do you understand me? -Yeah,I can do that.

218
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,330
Go.

219
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,230
With the last three missiles,

220
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,780
make sure you overlap these populations centers in San Francisco.

221
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,660
Locking up GPS coordinates,sir.

222
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,960
Keep working.

223
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,790
-Did you hear that? -Yes,sir.Down there.

224
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,750
Come with me,both of you.

225
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,670
The control room's right behind us.

226
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,520
I have a visual on one hostile.

227
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,170
Agent McCullough, I'm going to move into position.

228
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,470
When he's directly above me,send me with the mirror.

229
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,730
Jack,the missiles are armed. Three minutes to launch.

230
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,150
We're clear.

231
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,560
Jack,I'm gonna have to manually reverse all these codes.

232
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,740
Do you have enough time?

233
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,750
I'll do my best.

234
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,760
I don't want to be in here any more than you if those F-18s take out this sub.

235
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,000
We're going to keep Bierko and his men out of here

236
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,250
Agent McCullough's down.

237
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,500
Bierko and one hostile remaining. Henderson,what is your status?

238
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,030
Jack,I need more time. You've got to hold them off.

239
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,820
60 seconds until they launch.

240
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,620
Jack?

241
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,700
Hang on,Jack.

242
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
It's almost there,Jack.

243
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,140
Four more seconds.

244
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,820
Ten seconds.

245
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,070
It's done.

246
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,500
The launch sequence is canceled.

247
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,220
I repeat,the launch sequence is canceled.

248
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,940
-Audrey,recall the F-18's. -I'm on it.

249
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,510
Bierko's dead. The submarine is secure.

250
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,010
-Jack,are you okay? -Bill,I'm fine.

251
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,730
I'm getting a lot of feedback.Take me off com.

252
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,280
Okay,Jack.

253
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,740
Hold it,Jack.

254
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,280
Now lower your arms real slow

255
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,660
and turn around.

256
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,720
You were never really going to let me go,were you?

257
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,310
No.

258
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,340
Good for you,Jack.

259
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,650
You were responsible for the deaths of David Palmer,

260
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,470
Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler.

261
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,910
They were friends of mine.

262
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,850
That's the way it works.

263
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,340
Identify yourself!

264
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,020
My name is Jack Bauer,

265
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,090
with the Counter Terrorist Unit,Los Angeles!

266
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,300
All the hostiles are dead!

267
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,500
Holster your weapons!

268
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,910
Sir,you need to contact Bill Buchanan immediately.

269
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,030
Okay. Lieutenant,I need access to a vehicle.

270
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,340
Petty Officer, get me a vehicle now!

271
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,130
Thank you.

272
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,010
Jack? Yeah.

273
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,550
I've been told the Navy's running clean up and security on the sub.

274
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,970
Yeah,they're here now.

275
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,030
Bill,Christopher Henderson is dead.

276
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,280
What? What happened?

277
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,300
He fired on me.I didn't have a choice.

278
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,130
Are you coming back to CTU?

279
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,470
Yeah,I'll be there soon.

280
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,250
All right,we'll see you then.

281
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,310
chloe,the Navy needs our access codes to our logs

282
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,600
so they can use them for their report.Can you pick up?

283
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,050
Yeah.

284
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,570
What codes do they need?

285
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,350
They don't. Get somewhere where you won't be overheard.

286
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,580
I'll have to get that from my screen.

287
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,580
Let me get back to my station.

288
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,140
I'm here.

289
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,090
What's going on?

290
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,670
I'm not coming back to CTU. I'm going after Logan.

291
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,650
What do you mean, going after Logan?

292
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,310
I'll fill you in on the details later.

293
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,070
Right now I need you to walk me through

294
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,810
modifying some field communications equipment.

295
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,270
That's not exactly my area,Jack.

296
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,440
Then you'll need to get some help.

297
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,280
Chloe,are you with me on this?

298
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,920
Yeah. What do you need?

299
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,020
Hold on,I'll give you a list.

300
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,360
Okay.

301
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,390
We're certain the missiles no longer pose a threat?

302
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,830
Yes,Mr. President.

303
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,120
We have complete control over the boat.

304
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,450
Vladimir Bierko and all his known associates are dead

305
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,440
or in custody.

306
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,920
So then it's all over,Mike.

307
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,800
It's over.

308
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,720
I need to make a statement before I go back to Washington.

309
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,110
About the successful resolution of the crisis.

310
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,400
Yes.

311
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,810
And about David Palmer.

312
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,140
Sir?

313
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,800
David's casket is being flown to Arlington for burial,

314
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,690
and I would like to say a few words alongside it at the airfield,

315
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,750
and then I'll fly back to Washington.

316
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,010
I'll get to work on it right away.

317
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,220
Good. Thank you,Mike.

318
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,140
For everything.

319
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,960
It's been a hell of a day.

320
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,070
Yes,sir.

321
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,220
It has.

322
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,700
Mike.

323
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,470
You need to come with me.

324
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,760
Come with you?

325
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,030
Please.

326
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,870
Oh,please.

327
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,390
-Mrs. Logan,have you been...? -No.

328
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,930
I've never been more sober.

329
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,490
Or more sane.

330
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,910
What's this about?

331
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,300
My husband.

332
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,380
What about him?

333
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,640
Mike,I know you've been troubled by Charles's actions today.

334
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,290
You know that something is terribly,terribly wrong.

335
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,090
You just can't put your finger on it.

336
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,620
Okay.

337
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,870
Tell me what this is about.

338
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,490
No,I'm going to show you.

339
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,570
It'll explain everything.Please come.

340
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,130
The mission to retake the submarine has been successful.

341
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,000
Hmm,so I understand.

342
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,390
You'll also be interested to know

343
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,430
Christopher Henderson was killed during the operation.

344
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,460
You're certain of this?

345
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,600
CTU has confirmed the information.

346
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,560
That's excellent.

347
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,330
But let's not fool ourselves into thinking that's the end of all our problems.

348
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,570
There's still Bauer to deal with.

349
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,300
Don't worry.

350
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,870
Mr. Bauer will be taken care of.

351
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,480
Good.

352
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,100
Mike. Over here.

353
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,570
Aaron...

354
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,650
What happened to you?

355
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,520
Agent Adams tried to kill me.

356
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,310
On the president's orders.

357
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,350
That doesn't make any sense.

358
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,720
Where is Agent Adams?

359
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,870
Mike,we need your help.

360
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,410
My God.

361
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,240
What the hell's going on here?

362
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,760
The president had something to do with this?

363
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,240
Everything.

364
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,590
He was involved with everything that happened today

365
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,790
supplying the terrorists with the nerve gas,

366
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,180
the murder of David Palmer.

367
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,670
But Walt Cummings?

368
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,560
Walt was just their scapegoat.

369
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,650
He didn't commit suicide.

370
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,500
He was murdered by a man who works for Charles.

371
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,620
Charles told me to be quiet.

372
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,160
For the good of the country.

373
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,870
Keep my mouth shut.

374
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,430
I can't do that.Not anymore.

375
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,960
Do you have proof?

376
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,910
Jack Bauer was in possession of a recording that implicated the president.

377
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,640
That's why Logan was willing

378
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,810
to go so far as to shoot a plane full of people down

379
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,110
because Jack was on it.

380
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,250
Well,where is this recording?

381
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,430
It's been destroyed.

382
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,550
I didn't want to believe it either,Mike,

383
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,080
but it's the truth,so help me God.

384
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,060
All right.

385
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,510
If this is true,we need to find another way

386
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,780
to make a case against the president.

387
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,900
You're right,but first we have to get Aaron off the ranch.

388
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,630
There can't be a record of it.

389
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,150
All right. You're right.

390
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,510
We need to move fast.

391
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,400
I know the men at the Western Gate well.

392
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,480
They won't stop and inspect the vehicle if I'm driving.

393
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,290
You'll hide in the back out of sight.

394
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,440
Thank you,Mike.

395
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,010
Give me the keys.

396
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,480
Aaron.

397
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,210
I'll be fine.

398
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,760
I'll go somewhere where your husband's people can't find me.

399
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,350
But will you let me know that you're all right?

400
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,960
It's probably safer if we don't have any contact.

401
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,930
Good-bye,Aaron.

402
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,230
Thank you.

403
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,100
Mike Novick.

404
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,660
Mike,it's Jack Bauer.

405
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,800
I know this is an unusual request,but I'm looking for Aaron Pierce.

406
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,310
I've been trying to reach him on his cell,but he's not answering.

407
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,950
It's Jack Bauer. He's trying to find you.

408
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,660
Can you put him on speaker?

409
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,230
Aaron's with me right now,Jack. Hold on.

410
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,950
It's all right,Jack. You can speak freely in front of Mike.

411
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,340
He knows what I know.

412
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,560
Aaron,where are you?

413
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,970
A few miles from the ranch.

414
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,220
What happened?

415
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,750
The president tried to have me killed,

416
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,880
but Mrs. Logan saved my life.

417
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,210
She and I both decided to bring Mike into this.

418
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,260
And I'm still trying to process everything they told me.

419
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,440
This is a real mess,Jack.

420
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,590
Mike,I'm calling Aaron because I need his help.I need yours,too.

421
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,010
Help with what?

422
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,890
Bringing President Logan to justice.

423
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,950
Well,Aaron said the recording you had

424
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,540
implicating the president was destroyed. Is that true?

425
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,490
Yes.

426
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,240
Well,without it you can't mount a case.

427
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,860
I can if I can get a direct confession from Logan.

428
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,830
I'm working with someone inside CTU.

429
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,350
They're setting up a digital uplink.

430
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,660
If I can get Logan to acknowledge everything that he's done today,

431
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,460
it's going to be all the evidence we need.

432
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,070
Jack,if you intend to physically coerce the president of the United States...

433
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,810
Mike,we need to do this now

434
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,910
The longer we wait,the more vulnerable we are.

435
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,290
President Logan tried to take me out,just like he did Aaron.

436
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,540
I don't need to remind you that he was responsible for David Palmer's assassination

437
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,980
and a terrorist attack on this country's soil.

438
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,440
He cannot be allowed to remain in office,not for one more day.

439
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,030
How long will it take you to get here?

440
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,170
20 minutes.

441
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,130
That's too late.President Logan will be gone.

442
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,280
He's leaving for Washington around that time.

443
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,920
Then you have to try and delay him.

444
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,210
I'm not sure I can do that.

445
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,240
Mike,just tell me you'll try.

446
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,990
All right.

447
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,010
But get here as fast as you can.

448
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,640
Okay. Thank you.

449
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:04,550
Yes,sir. I'll get on a plane as soon as I finish our debrief with the Navy.

450
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,360
Homeland's ordered me to Washington as soon as I file the Bierko case.

451
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,740
Apparently,the request came from the White House.

452
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,450
Logan's looking for an excuse to clean house.

453
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,740
I'm sure I'll be next.

454
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,580
Come in.

455
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,720
Yes,Chloe.Do you have something?

456
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,240
I need an authorization code.

457
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,010
For what?

458
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,210
I need access to a high-clearance workstation.

459
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,700
You already have access.

460
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,110
It's for some new personnel.

461
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,320
What?

462
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,580
Morris?

463
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,610
You're bringing Morris back?

464
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,620
Yes.

465
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,960
Why,Chloe?

466
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,300
Because I'm still trying to salvage something from the recording that Miles erased.

467
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,000
If anyone can do it, it's Morris.

468
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,060
I didn't thk Morris was even on the government payroll anymore.

469
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,180
He's not.

470
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,500
What's he doing?

471
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,780
He's selling women's shoes in Beverly Hills.

472
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,440
What?

473
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,510
Is this a joke?

474
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,720
No. You know I wouldn't have brought him in if there was anyone else I could call.

475
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,770
Please,Mr. Buchanan.

476
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,330
Thank you.

477
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,790
Bill...

478
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,960
-It's going to be all right. -Who is this guy?

479
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,900
Morris O'Brian.

480
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,600
Chloe's ex-husband.

481
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,970
No,no,not like that. May I?

482
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,290
See,the beauty of the beast is if you leave these fields blank,

483
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,170
it'll prompt you for a code.Ba-bing. See that?

484
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,620
You just saved 60 seconds.

485
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,610
Ten of those a day, that's an extra cigarette break

486
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,070
or whatever it is you do to take the edge off.

487
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,420
Morris.

488
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,620
What are you doing?

489
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,410
Just making your people more efficient.

490
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,460
I noticed you picked the most attractive one.

491
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,360
Wrong. You're the most attractive one.

492
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,230
Here's your clearance.

493
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,030
I'm surprised you got Bill Buchanan to sign off on me.

494
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,470
You know,this is a really good opportunity for you.

495
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,410
Why don't you surprise me and not totally screw it up?

496
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,960
Okay.I'm going to pretend that this will require all my focus and attention,

497
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,340
even though we both know I can do it in my sleep.

498
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,700
Sit down.

499
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,660
So where is this recording you want me to resurrect?

500
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,520
Nothing. Forget it. It's fried.

501
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,300
I'm missing something.

502
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,400
You said you wanted me to salvage a digital recording.

503
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,890
That was an excuse.

504
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,560
I need some comm unit modifications.

505
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,320
I need a certified digital audio transfer rate of 6.8.

506
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,590
I can only get to 6.5.

507
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,150
Can you do that without talking?

508
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,030
I could,but it'd be a terrible waste of my charm.

509
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,510
Okay. I'm not listening anymore.

510
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,250
Call me when you're done.Thanks.

511
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,180
Behind me,you can see preparations

512
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,370
as the casket bearing the body of David Palmer is due here shortly.

513
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,530
It will be met by President Logan who is scheduled

514
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,650
to make a statement before he flies back to Washington...

515
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,300
Is Aaron safe?

516
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,630
Yes.

517
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,340
Thank God.

518
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,530
I can't believe Charles is going to do this.

519
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,530
He has David's blood on his hand,

520
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,370
he has the audacity to eulogize him in front of the whole world.

521
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,970
Mrs. Logan...

522
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:18,340
I said earlier there was no way to make a case against your husband.I was wrong.

523
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,040
Jack Bauer, the former CTU agent,

524
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,900
contacted Aaron and me. He's on his way here now.

525
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,000
What for?

526
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,870
He's going to confront your husband directly.

527
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,630
Confront him?

528
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,210
What's he going to do?

529
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:36,320
Jack Bauer will do whatever it takes to compel your husband to confess the truth.

530
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,250
He's the only one I know who can do this.

531
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,910
When will he be here?

532
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,180
15 minutes.

533
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,820
But Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately.

534
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,570
I know,I know,I tried to delay him myself,

535
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,330
but he wouldn't change his schedule.That's why I'm coming to you.

536
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,640
I need you to keep him here.

537
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,060
Martha...

538
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:04,150
if you want your husband brought to justice,this is our only chance.

539
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,450
You have to find the way to staller him.

540
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,720
Aaron,it's good to see you.

541
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,350
Same here,Jack.

542
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,110
Was Mike able to delay the President?

543
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,980
He's trying.But he had to ask Mrs. Logan for some help.

544
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,150
The First Lady knows what we intend to do?

545
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,220
She does.

546
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,470
Aaron...

547
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,190
can she be trusted?

548
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,600
She is with us,Jack...

549
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,990
100%.

550
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,450
Can you still get access to the Secret Service deployment grid?

551
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,450
I already have.

552
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,490
The way security has been beefed up around the main building,

553
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,660
there's no way you're going to be able to get Logan alone there.

554
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,420
Is Marine One taking him to the airfield?

555
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,860
No,this was last minute.

556
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,840
They're transporting him by reduced detachment.

557
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,520
They're using a Navy helicopter.

558
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,770
That's where this has to happen.

559
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,070
I need to get on that chopper.

560
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,050
I don't see how that's going to be possible.

561
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,580
Aaron,you get me as close to that helicopter as you can

562
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,620
and then we'll figure it out from there.

563
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,840
All right.

564
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,520
Let's go.

565
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,580
Yes,I agree,Wayne Palmer should be at the airfield.

566
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,630
But if you can't find him, I'm not going to wait for him.

567
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,950
Yes,I'm leaving now.

568
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,860
Have a copy of my speech on the chopper,

569
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,670
and I'll work on it on the flight over.

570
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,550
I'll be out of your way in a second.

571
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:56,550
I saw on your schedule that you're meeting David Palmer's casket at the airfield.

572
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,410
If you came here to judge me,Martha,I really don't have time...

573
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,890
No,no.

574
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,550
That's not it.

575
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,890
I've had time to reflect and I...

576
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,600
I think I owe you an apology.

577
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,120
All right.

578
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,890
I said some horrible things to you.

579
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,090
I've had horrible things said to me before...

580
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,420
and by you.

581
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,890
But there was one thing you said that I can't get over.

582
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,020
What?

583
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,400
That I broke your heart...

584
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,360
and that you hated me.

585
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,690
Well,I wish I could take those words back.

586
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,280
All I can ask now is that you forgive me.

587
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,840
Please,Charles...

588
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,600
I don't know how to respond,Marty.

589
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,260
I never expected you to say anything like this.

590
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,310
I mean it,Charles,I...

591
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,240
I mean it, I need you to forgive me.

592
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,660
You mean it now, but you know how you are.

593
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,850
By tomorrow,I could be the man you hate again.

594
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,030
I know.

595
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,250
It'll take time for me to prove myself to you,

596
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,480
but the truth is...

597
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,220
even though sometimes I don't understand you,

598
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,700
I still need you.

599
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,540
And I still love you.

600
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,680
And that will never change,Charles.

601
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,770
Not tomorrow,not ever.

602
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,050
I need you,too,Marty.

603
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,470
Fly with me to Washington.

604
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,450
We can spend some time together.

605
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,760
On a plane surrounded by Secret Service?

606
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:21,750
Why can't we just spend a little more time here,together,alone?

607
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,370
You know that's not possible. I have to go.

608
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,130
I had to go five minutes ago.

609
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,830
Okay,Charles.

610
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,500
You go.

611
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,970
Come with me.

612
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,960
I have a better idea.

613
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,230
There's a helicopter waiting for me.

614
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,470
Let it wait.

615
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,710
I can't.

616
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,640
Yes,you can.

617
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,120
You're the President.

618
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,470
Tell the helicopter to stand by.

619
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,990
Yes.

620
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,120
Until I'm ready.

621
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,260
And make sure I'm not disturbed.

622
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,630
It's clear.

623
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,550
Yeah.

624
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,190
The President just notified Secret Service he's going to be delayed.

625
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,200
How long?

626
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,380
He didn't say.

627
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,700
But Mrs. Logan knows we need as much time as possible.

628
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,280
Jack...

629
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,820
if Logan doesn't confess,

630
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,980
how far are you actually willing to go?

631
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,650
As far as I have to.
