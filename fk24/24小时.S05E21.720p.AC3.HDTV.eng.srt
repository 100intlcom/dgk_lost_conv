1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,700
We release the sentox here

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,200
and 200 000 people die.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,400
We need access to the control room.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Jack bierko will be ready to deploy any minute.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
If we could ignite that gas before it leaves the plant

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,900
the sentox will be incinerated.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,200
Bierko!

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,600
Give me a hand.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,300
Organize an escort team.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,200
You get him back to CTU alive.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,400
You got it.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,000
I just word from the faa about a hiJacking aboard a diplomatic flight.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,700
So what?

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,900
Jack Bauer is the Hijacker.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,300
What was he doing on that flight?

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,300
Looking for the recording that implicates me in David Palmer's death.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,400
Order the plane down and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
We need to take him down now

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,700
dead or alive.

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Mr. President?

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,400
I don't care if Bauer's making threats or not

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
that plane has to land immediately.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,200
And when it lands

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,000
I want my secret service detail to take him into custody.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,800
Sit down!

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,100
He has a gun!

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,600
Everybody just stay in your seats!

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,300
Do what I tell you

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,600
and no one will get hurt!

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,000
Captain

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,900
this I Jack Bauer.

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,700
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,800
The person that I'm looking for

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,100
the man with the evidence that I need

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,400
is sitting next to you.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,500
He's your copilot Scott Evans.

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,200
You need to open the door.

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,700
Could you

39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,400
take the stick for a second?

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm the only one who can fly this plane now!

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
Give me the recording.

42
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,600
Advise CTU I have the recording.

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,900
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.

44
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,100
Bauer's got the evidence.

45
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,600
He is in control of the plane.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,100
What do we do?

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,800
You are going to have to shoot down that plane Mr. President.

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,200
Otherwise

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,000
you'll go to prison for treason and murder.

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
The following takes place between 3Am and 4Am.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,100
Sierra tango cleared to flight level 2-2-0 report reaching.

52
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,500
5-2-0 sierra tango descend to flight level 2-2-0.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,600
We can expect the approach to van nuys.

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,800
Good.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,700
This is Jack Bauer.

56
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,300
Can you patch me through to Karen Hayes?

57
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
Hold please.

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm bleeding.

59
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,400
I think you broke my nose.

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,200
You'll get medical attention as soon as we're on the ground.

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Right now your only concern should be flying this plane.

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,100
Miss Hayes I've got Jack Bauer on line one.

63
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,400
Put him through.

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You are connected.

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I've got the recording.

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
It was on the copilot.

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
The copilot?

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
he was working for henderson.

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,500
The captain's unconscious

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,800
but I've secured the copilot.

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,900
We're en route back to van nuys airfield.

72
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,200
What's our eta?

73
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,700
21 minutes.

74
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,200
We're going to be on the ground in 21 minutes.

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,500
Karen listen to me.

76
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,250
This recording proves that president Logan

77
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,000
was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
It'simperative that we do not let it fall into the hands

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
of anyone that is loyal to the president.

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
As soon as we're on the ground

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm going to need you to provide me with a safe corridor back to CTU.

82
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,700
Jack it's Bill.

83
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm back here with Karen.

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,900
I'll explain everything later.

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
We can dispatch a team to meet you at the airfield.

86
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,400
They can head off any law enforcement

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
take you into protective custody.

88
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,900
Okay good.

89
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,200
Bill how is Audrey?

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,300
Curtis just brought her in.

91
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,500
She's in medical getting treated

92
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,900
but it looks like she's going to be okay.

93
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,200
Thank god.

94
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,300
Okay I'll get back to you as soon as we're on final approach.

95
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,200
All right.

96
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,400
Audrey.

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
I just got off the phone with county general.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
I have some great news.

99
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,600
Your father survived the crash.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,800
He's alive?

101
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,400
one of our teams picked him up about 30 minutes ago at the accident site.

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
He's still in icu

103
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
but they expect him to pull through.

104
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Oh my god.

105
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
We have a team stationed at the hospital.

106
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,600
He'll be well-protected.

107
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you.

108
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500
I have to take this.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
Curtis?

110
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,500
Thank you so much.

111
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,600
You're welcome.

112
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,700
This is manning.

113
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,000
Is henderson secured?

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,100
He's in holding room three.

115
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,600
Good.

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I need you to take a team to pick up Jack.

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,200
Where is he?

118
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,500
He's on a plane heading towards the van nuys airport.

119
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Eta is 20 minutes.

120
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,200
Why is he on a plane?

121
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,500
He had to commandeer the plane

122
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,300
in order to secure the evidence against president Logan.

123
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
I'll brief you with the details en route.

124
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,600
Curtis I cannot emphasize strongly enough

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
the explosive nature of the evidence that Jack is carrying.

126
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,500
I need you to put him into protective custody

127
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
and bring him back here to CTU.

128
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,400
Understood.

129
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,300
President Logan will probably send his men to retrieve it.

130
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,000
You've got to get to Jack first.

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,700
We will.

132
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,600
I'm heading out.

133
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,100
yes?

134
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,100
We have a solution that will allow you to order the plane shot down.

135
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,200
I sure as hell hope so.

136
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,000
I may be the president

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but there are protocols in place that I can't just ignore.

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
What we're proposing will circumvent your protocols.

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,500
What is it?

140
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,000
We're going to simulate a vci distress signal.

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,400
It'll be broadcast on the airplane's transponder code

142
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,000
and it will appear to come from Bauer's flight.

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,900
Hold on.

144
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,800
What is a vci distress signal?

145
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,500
It's an emergency signal indicating that there's a hiJacking in progress


147
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,800
All you need to do is appear to struggle with the ethics

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
and then give the order.

149
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,700
Mr. President?

150
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,600
Fine.

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
All right.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
You sound reluctant.

153
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
I can't believe it's come to this.

154
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,400
I'm going to shoot down a plane full of innocent people.

155
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,700
None of us is happy about this Mr. President

156
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,000
but you don't really have a choice.

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,500
Bauer has evidence implicating you in this conspiracy

158
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,420
and I don't have to tell you what the consequences will be for all of us

159
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,820
if it's released.

160
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,600
We should contact chloe and bring her in.

161
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
We're going to want her help bringing Jack back to CTU.

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,200
Fine.

163
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,700
Send an escort.

164
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,100
Karen

165
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,600
I appreciate this.

166
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,100
I know you're putting everything on the line to help us.

167
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,400
All I can say is this recording better be everything Jack claims it is.

168
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
I know Jack.

169
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,900
I don't always agree with his methods

170
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,600
but I trust his judgment.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
I'll go make that call.

172
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,100
What's going on?

173
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,400
What's Buchanan doing out of holding?

174
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,100
The situation has changed Miles.

175
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,200
There's some new intel.

176
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,000
I haven't seen anything.

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,900
What new intel?

178
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,300
I don't have time to explain it right now.

179
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,100
What does that mean?

180
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
It means that I'll brief you when I've got the chance.

181
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
Have you compiled the orders for bierko's transfer?

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm still working on them.

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Let me know when you've got them.

184
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,400
What is it Mike?

185
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,200
A situation has come up regarding the hiJacked plane.

186
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,100
Tell me what's happening.

187
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,600
The faa just picked up a vci distress code.

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,200
It originated from flight st-520.

189
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,700
What's a vci distress code?

190
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,500
The vci is a coding system that was recently installed on all commercial airliners.

191
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,000
This particular code indicates that a hiJacking is underway

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,700
and that the plane is going to be used to target installations on the ground.

193
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Oh my god.

194
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,400
Admiral Kirkland is standing by on video-conference from point mugu.

195
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
He's ready to brief you with the details.

196
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,200
Admiral Kirkland

197
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,100
I'm Mike novick.

198
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,300
I have the president here.

199
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,600
Mr. President.

200
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,200
Admiral.

201
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,500
Mike's told me about this vci signal.

202
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,100
How could it have been sent without Bauer's knowledge?

203
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,400
Most likely one of the pilots under duress secretly activated the transponder code.

204
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Let me get this straight.

205
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,100
At last report Bauer was in the passenger cabin.

206
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,700
Does this mean that he's now in the cockpit

207
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,200
and that he's in control of the plane?

208
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,600
It appears that way sir.

209
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
what do we do admiral?

210
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,100
Sir the protocols for this scenario are clearly specified.

211
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,800
We're compelled to take preemptive action.

212
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
What action?

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
The aircraft must be shot down.

214
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,300
We've already scrambled an f-18 out of point mugu.

215
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,600
We just need your approval to engage.

216
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,300
There are over 50 people on that plane admiral.

217
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,400
We have to think of the people on the ground Mr. President.

218
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Over 20 million citizens live in los angeles county

219
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
each one of them is now a potential target.

220
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,600
I don't believe this.

221
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,800
Mr. President if I can interject.

222
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Admiral it's hard for me to accept that

223
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,700
Bauer intends to use the aircraft as a weapon against civilians.

224
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,100
From my briefing document

225
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,600
Jack Bauer is a distraught individual with a history of erratic behavior.

226
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Jack Bauer has spent his entire career protecting american lives.

227
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,100
I think there's a reason he's doing what he's doing.

228
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,400
What would that be?

229
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,400
I don't have the answer

230
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,600
but we should at least try to find out.

231
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
We don't have the time.

232
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,700
Mr. President

233
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,200
we could have the f-18 shadow the aircraft.

234
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,700
We could issue a standing order to fire

235
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,500
only if the target deviates from its present course.

236
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,600
That's not a viable option Mr. President.

237
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,300
Why not?

238
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,200
Right now that plane is over the desert.

239
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
In another 15 minutes

240
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,300
it'll be above los angeles.

241
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,600
If we're forced to shoot it down then

242
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,300
there'll be facing massive casualties on the ground.

243
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,600
And Mr. President

244
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,350
we must also consider the possibility that

245
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,100
Bauer intends to attack the presidential retreat.

246
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,300
The retreat?

247
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,600
You're inside the target zone

248
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,500
and Bauer's already been accused of killing one president today.

249
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,300
The simple fact is sir

250
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,700
we don't know what his intentions are.

251
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,300
Mr. President...

252
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,600
Mike. Stop.

253
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
I've made my decision.

254
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,500
Admiral I'm authorizing you to shoot down that plane.

255
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes sir.

256
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,900
Mr. President...

257
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,600
Mike please.

258
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,600
Don't make this any more difficult for me than it already is.

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
Miss Hayes.

260
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
This just came in over the interagency sub-net.

261
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,600
What is it?

262
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,200
We have to alert Jack.

263
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,100
This is Bauer.

264
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,600
Jack

265
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,700
air traffic control just received a vci distress signal from your aircraft.

266
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,100
That effectively authorizes president Logan to shoot you down.

267
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,200
Shoot us down?

268
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,300
And f-18's been scrambled out of point mugu Jack.

269
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,400
You have eight to ten minutes at best.

270
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,500
Can you patch me through to the pilot of the f-18?

271
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,600
No chance.

272
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
They're on a coded frequency.

273
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
We can try to get in touch with the white house.

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
And tell them what?

275
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,500
They don't want to hear anything I have to say.

276
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,600
Hold on.

277
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
We need to land this plane now.

278
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,700
We're 100 Miles from the nearest airport.

279
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,900
They just scrambled an f-18 to shoot us out of the sky.

280
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,200
We need to get on the ground now!

281
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,100
You didn't hear me.

282
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,200
There's nowhere to land.

283
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
How much runway do you need?

284
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,200
At least 5 000 feet.

285
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,100
Bill do you hear me?

286
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Jack.

287
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,000
I need you to look for a stretch of freeway 5 000 feet long

288
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,500
straight enough for us to land on.

289
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,100
I'll pull up maps in the area Jack.

290
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
It'll take a few seconds.

291
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,200
Get back to me as soon as you've got something.

292
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,100
We can't land on the freeway.

293
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Yes we can.

294
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,400
It's late there's a curfew.

295
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,600
There won't be any cars on the freeway.

296
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,600
Cuff your right hand to the flight control now.

297
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
All the way.

298
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,000
Start taking us down.

299
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,600
Do it now.

300
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,600
What's chloe o'brian doing here?

301
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,900
I don't know.

302
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,900
You can go.

303
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,200
What's going on?

304
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,600
An f-18's been scrambled to shoot down Jack's plane.

305
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,100
Can you open up a socket with the atc radar tracking plot?

306
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,100
Yeah I think so.

307
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,600
Do it chloe.

308
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,300
We need to know the exact amount of time

309
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,000
Jack has before the fighter plane reaches him.

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,500
Okay.

311
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,300
Karen look at this.

312
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,000
Two possible landing sites.

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,700
I think this one's the best shot.

314
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,300
I agree.

315
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,700
Let's get Jack on the phone.

316
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
I need to speak with you.

317
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,300
We need to make an emergency landing.

318
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Talk to your passengers and get them ready.

319
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,000
What's happening?

320
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Don't worry.

321
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,500
Everything's gonna be fine.

322
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,400
Just get them ready.

323
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,300
Okay.

324
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay.

325
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,100
Listen up everybody.

326
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,500
We're going to prepare for an emergency landing.

327
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,300
The proper procedure...

328
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,000
it's Bauer.

329
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,700
Jack it's Bill

330
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,000
I think we found something.

331
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,800
Bill hold on one second.

332
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,100
I want to put you on speakerphone.

333
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,900
Go ahead.

334
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a stretch of the 118 freeway between mile marker 91 and 92.

335
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
There's about 4 000 feet

336
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,400
then there's an overpass.

337
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,500
That's not long enough.

338
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,900
It's the best we can do.

339
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,500
Copy that Bill.

340
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,200
Hold on give me a second.

341
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
You can either try and land this plane on the freeway or I will.

342
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,300
Give me the coordinates.

343
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:50,100
3-4-5-0.2 north by 1-1-0-3-0.4 west.

344
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
We need to know where that f-18 is.

345
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,900
Jack it's chloe.

346
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,300
I'm working on it.

347
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,300
Manning.

348
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,700
We have the exact location where Jack's putting down.

349
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,400
Go ahead.

350
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,900
It's the 118 freeway between mile markers 91 and 92.

351
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,200
He should be on the ground within minutes.

352
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,900
Copy.

353
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,000
We're redirecting.

354
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,300
118 freeway.

355
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Mr. President we're five minutes away.

356
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,900
I'm patching us in directly with the pilot of the f-18.

357
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Go ahead.

358
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,100
Bravo one

359
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,800
this is admiral Kirkland.

360
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
You're on with the president and myself.

361
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,900
Report status.

362
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,100
My radar is locked onto the target.

363
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,700
Okay I've got the atc radar plot.

364
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,300
Put it on the main screen.

365
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,300
Jack the f-18 is within 15 Miles.

366
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,800
They're not gonna make it.

367
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,400
He's gonna be within the missile range in two minutes.

368
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,000
You're not descending fast enough.

369
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,300
If we increase the descent rate

370
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,500
we won't be able to pull out of the dive.

371
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,700
If we don't get on the ground before that f-18 reaches us

372
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,300
it's not gonna matter. Descend now!

373
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,900
Put the oxygen masks on!

374
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,100
Target has increased angle and rate of descent.

375
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,300
One minute from missile lock.

376
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,100
Jack they're almost within weapons range.

377
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,400
The aircraft can't take this.

378
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,500
I have to pull up.

379
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,700
Not yet!

380
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,300
I can see the freeway!

381
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,300
Come on.

382
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,200
Okay level up now!

383
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,300
Now!

384
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
We can't pull out of the dive!

385
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,300
I need your help!

386
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Pull!

387
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,100
ground proximity alert.

388
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,700
20 seconds to missile lock.

389
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,600
Target's at 1 000 feet and leveling.

390
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,300
Leveling?

391
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,300
Affirmative sir.

392
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,900
What does that mean?

393
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,100
Target may be preparing to land.

394
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,900
The objective seems to be the 118 freeway.

395
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,900
Lower the landing gear!

396
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,800
We're going too fast!

397
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,100
Lower it!

398
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
He's lowering his landing gear.

399
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
The f-18's in range.

400
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,600
I have missile lock.

401
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
The aircraft is in a landing profile sir.

402
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
I recommend we abort.

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,800
What?

404
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
The parameters have changed sir.

405
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,300
I want that plane shot down!

406
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,900
Sir...

407
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,800
order your man to fire now!

408
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,100
Mr. President!

409
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,300
Admiral Kirkland is right.

410
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
The aircraft's not a threat.

411
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,300
There's no reason to do this.

412
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,900
I implore you to reconsider.

413
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,300
Sir we have a lock,what are your orders.

414
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,100
Abort.

415
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,800
Yes sir.

416
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,100
But if they don't land

417
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,400
I want you to shoot that plane down immediately!

418
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,600
Yes Mr. President.

419
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,300
Bravo one hold fire.

420
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
I repeat hold fire.

421
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,500
Copy base.

422
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
Bravo one holding fire.

423
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,600
We have marine units deployed in the area.

424
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,500
I want them to cordon off the landing site

425
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,400
and apprehend Jack Bauer.

426
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,300
Yes sir.

427
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,300
500 feet!

428
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,300
We're not gonna make it.

429
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,300
Come on.

430
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
CTU.

431
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,400
CTU We've spotted the plane.

432
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,000
They're coming in for a landing.

433
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,300
We're heading towards them now.

434
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm handing the controls back to you!

435
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,200
Touch it down!

436
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,300
We're still going too fast!

437
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
Touch it down!

438
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
target has touched down.

439
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,900
I'm clear.

440
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,100
Returning to base.

441
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,100
Bill we made it.

442
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,300
We're down on the ground.

443
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,200
Jack we've redirected Curtis to your location.

444
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
He should be there in a few minutes.

445
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm just east of the balboa overpass.

446
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,300
Have him meet me there.

447
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Send a secondary team to pick up the copilot

448
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,700
Got it.

449
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,100
Get out of there Jack!

450
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,800
Everyone keep moving to the rear of the plane!

451
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,900
Exit from the rear now!

452
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,200
You should have followed through Mr. President.

453
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,500
You should have orderehould have ordered that pilot to fire.

454
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,200
They were landing on a freeway.

455
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,100
I had no pretext to shoot them down.

456
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,700
I had to abort.

457
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,400
It's going to be much harder to contain now

458
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,300
if not impossible.

459
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,000
Bauer's on the ground.

460
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,300
He won't get far.

461
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,100
Even before the plane touched down

462
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,900
I ordered two battalions of marines into the area.

463
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,200
They're cordoning off the landing site  even as we speak.

464
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,500
Bauer...

465
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,900
has nowhere to run.

466
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,400
I hope you're right Mr. President.

467
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,300
This is our last chance.

468
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,100
If Bauer gets through...

469
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,500
I know.

470
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,900
I know what's at stake Graham.

471
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,300
I'll get back to you as soon as I have any news.

472
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,100
Curtis it's Jack!

473
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,600
Go ahead.

474
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,500
The marines are moving in.

475
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,700
They're setting up a perimeter.

476
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,500
Where are you?

477
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,700
We're approaching your position from the north.

478
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,100
Okay I got you.

479
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,500
I'll meet you on the north side of the freeway.

480
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,820
they know I'm still in the area. We got to get out of here.

481
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,020
Head south on variel. Move.

482
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,080
Damn it. You're gonna have to try and talk your way through the roadblock.

483
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,580
Get your hands up!

484
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,400
Hands where we can see them.

485
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,600
We're federal agents.

486
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,250
Los angeles counter terrorist unit.

487
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,130
We've been given orders to detain everybody inside this perimeter.

488
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,000
We're all on the same team here commander.

489
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,880
We're trying to apprehend the suspect who hiJacked that plane.

490
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,540
-Jack Bauer? -That's right.Now let us do our job.

491
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,140
I need to see individual id'S. I'm gonna call this in.

492
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,120
We don't have time for this commander.

493
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,110
The longer we sit here the better chance Bauer has of slipping through the net.

494
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,720
-This will only take a few minutes. -A few minutes is all Bauer needs to escape.

495
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,830
We're not prepared to let that happen.

496
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,220
Now we're moving out.If you really want to fire on federal agents that's your call.

497
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,280
Stand down.

498
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,720
Move out.

499
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,800
Stand down!

500
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,860
Head east for a while  then turn south.

501
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,270
Yes sir.

502
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,350
-Buchanan. -It's Curtis.

503
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,930
-We've got Jack and we're headed back in. -Okay Curtis.

504
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,960
Marines are all over the place. Barely got past one of the patrols.

505
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,090
They must be taking direct orders from Logan. There's no other explanation.

506
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,310
We can't take the chance of running into any more of these patrols.

507
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,230
-We'll stick to the back streets. -Understood.

508
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,730
Hayes.

509
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,550
I want to know what's going on.

510
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,840
Miles I told you I would tell you when I felt the time was right.

511
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,290
I'm sitting here watching you work with two people

512
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,750
under arrest for aiding and abetting a federal fugitive.

513
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,860
If you don't talk to me  I'll have to get my answers somewhere else.

514
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,590
I'll be right there.

515
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,550
-You can't tell him. -I can't hold him off any longer.

516
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,720
You really think that's a good idea?

517
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,580
I have to trust him.

518
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,740
He's been nothing but loyal.

519
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,590
I probably shouldn't have kept him in the dark this long.

520
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,200
I'll be right back.

521
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,390
I don't appreciate being threatened Miles.

522
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,920
And I don't appreciate being shut out.

523
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,000
We've worked a lot of years together Karen

524
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,210
and I have never wavered in my allegiance.

525
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,660
I don't deserve this.

526
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,810
No you don't.

527
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,660
Come with me.

528
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,900
Jack Bauer's acquired evidence implicating president Logan in David Palmer's death.

529
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,680
-Have you seen this evidence? -No but Bauer's bringing it here now.

530
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,960
What is it?

531
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,350
It's a recording of a conversation between the president and an accomplice.

532
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,490
-But you haven't heard it? -No.

533
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,350
And that's what you're doing with Buchanan and o'brian?

534
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,540
Covertly helping Bauer?

535
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,220
Yes.

536
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,170
For the past three hours president Logan has

537
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,870
done everything in his power to keep Jack from getting back here alive.

538
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,770
You're working against the most powerful man in the world

539
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,160
and you haven't actually heard the evidence.

540
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,500
This is why I didn't talk to you Miles.

541
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,840
Because you knew I'd talk you out of it.

542
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,870
Yes I know what I'm doing is risky.

543
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,900
If I am wrong  my career is over.I could be brought up on charges.

544
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,180
Not just your career Karen.

545
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,390
I am doing this because I believe that Bauer is telling the truth.

546
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,730
But you don't know.

547
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,630
Okay okay.

548
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,750
Let's say he is.

549
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,660
Let's say that recording implicates Logan.

550
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,930
Then what are you going to do?

551
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,080
Are you going to arrest the president of the United States?

552
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,370
That will be up to the attorney general.

553
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,410
-You're depending on... -I'm sorry to interrupt.

554
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,480
-Yes. -They're ready to move bierko.

555
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,520
Thank you. I'll be right out.

556
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,370
Look I have to go over the transfer protocols.

557
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,390
I know that what I'm asking from you is difficult.

558
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,340
Everything rests with what's on that recording.

559
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,410
Tell me what you need.

560
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,090
Bauer will be here any minute.

561
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,130
The best way for you to help me is to go back

562
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,180
out there and keep things running smoothly.

563
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,780
-All right. -Miles?

564
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,480
-It's imperative this stay between us. -Of course.

565
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Thank you.

566
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,450
Thank you.

567
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,460
We have a full tactical complement  enhanced ordinance package two vehicle escort.

568
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,080
Vladimir bierko you're being transferred

569
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,520
to a primary holding facility at our district headquarters.

570
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,080
-Let me know the second he arrives. -Understood.

571
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,520
Let's move out.

572
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,720
Let's go.

573
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,140
-Where the hell is Mike novick? -He's moments away sir.

574
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,300
You told me that three minutes ago.

575
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,390
Yes sir.

576
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,870
I'm sorry Mr. President. I was on the phone with colonel Owens.

577
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,850
He's the marine field commander on the site.

578
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,430
-Is Bauer in custody? -No sir.

579
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,780
What happened?

580
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,940
As ordered the marines sealed off a one-mile radius around the landing site.

581
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,670
They've completed a sweep of the area.

582
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,640
And?

583
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,940
And it's colonel Owens' estimation that

584
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,210
Bauer is no longer inside the perimeter.

585
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,100
-He got away. -It appears so sir.

586
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,330
I can't believe this.

587
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,360
Uh Mr. President it's only a matter of time before Bauer's apprehended.

588
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,830
Sir are you all right?

589
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,890
Thank you Mike.I need some time alone now.

590
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,160
Jack the attorney general's on his way to his office right now.

591
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,430
He'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes.

592
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,280
Okay good.Chloe I want you to prepare the recording for playback.

593
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,150
I want you to clean it up and apply a digital signature

594
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,020
so that we can establish a chain of evidence.

595
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,420
-Okay. -You need to work alone.

596
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,360
I don't want anyone else near that recording.

597
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,300
You don't ever let it out of your sight.

598
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,520
-I won't. -You said I had ten minutes.

599
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,170
-I'd like to see Audrey. -Of course.She's in medical.

600
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,620
Thank you.

601
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,720
No,ma'am he is still in ICU.

602
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,470
Well when will I be able to speak with him?

603
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,990
-Sorry I don't know. -All right I understand.

604
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,980
Well just let him know...

605
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,310
can you please tell him that his daughter called and that...

606
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,240
she loves him very much.

607
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,410
Thank you.

608
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,000
It looks like my dad's gonna be all right.

609
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,010
Yeah I know I heard.

610
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,380
Oh god I'm so glad to see you.

611
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,250
Me too.

612
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,390
We did it.

613
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,400
The attorney general's going to hear it.

614
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,050
-So it's over? -Yeah.

615
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,780
President Logan's going to pay for David Palmer's assassination.

616
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,080
Thank you.

617
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,780
Close your eyes.

618
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,790
I'm going to sit with you for a minute.

619
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,180
-Yes. -Graham.

620
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,270
-I've been trying to reach you. -I know.

621
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,740
-Bauer slipped through the cordon didn't he? -Yes.

622
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,350
I've just been told that

623
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:52,020
the attorney general's office received a phone call from the director of CTU.

624
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,810
I think it's fairly obvious they're in possession of the recording.

625
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,360
I think that phone call was about you.

626
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,460
I didn't expect it would to happen so soon.

627
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,880
I am sorry Charles.

628
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,560
You don't deserve this.

629
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,950
Listen Graham despite how things turned out...

630
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,910
...I still believe that we were in the right.

631
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,430
I still believe that we acted in the best interest of the country.

632
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,130
And we have to keep putting the country's well-being ahead of our own.

633
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,760
The spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder would be devastating.

634
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,240
Yes. Yes it would.

635
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,730
Aside from the psychological damage to the country

636
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:39,520
a trial would expose certain realities that should never see the light of day.

637
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,850
If only we could keep such a trial from taking place.

638
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,230
That thought occurred to me  as well.

639
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,990
I'm glad we agree.

640
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,600
I want you to know I've taken steps to ensure

641
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,400
that you and your associates won't be implicated in any of this.

642
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,570
I appreciate that Charles.

643
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,190
We all do.

644
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,530
There's nothing more to say.

645
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,570
I'm going to hang up now.There are uh

646
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,020
a few things I'd like to take care of before...

647
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,610
Good-bye Charles.

648
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,140
Good-bye Graham.

649
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,030
Martha may I come in?

650
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,210
Now you want to talk?

651
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,410
Marti please?

652
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,020
What do you want?

653
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,810
Is there something else you want to confess?

654
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,410
No.

655
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,470
I want to tell you how sorry I am...

656
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,760
for everything.

657
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,800
When you forget to give me something for my birthday

658
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,450
that's when you say you're sorry.

659
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,520
I know what I did was wrong.It was horribly wrong and unforgivable.I know that.

660
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,560
But what I can't live with is the fact that I hurt you.

661
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,000
That's the last thing I wanted to do.

662
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,760
Marti?

663
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,510
Marti please.

664
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,380
That's the truth.

665
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,610
The truth.

666
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,120
You know what really gets me Charles?

667
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,050
What?

668
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,080
That you had me going for so long.

669
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,690
That you had me going for so long.

670
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,270
If I wasn't so horrified by the fact that

671
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,020
I'm married to you I might actually be impressed.

672
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,390
Yes.

673
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,610
I have an urgent call for you sir.

674
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,840
He says his name is Miles Papazian from CTU.

675
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,470
I don't want to talk to anyone from CTU.

676
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,130
He insists that you'll want to speak to him.

677
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,300
He says it's about Jack Bauer.

678
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,150
-Put him through. -Yes sir.

679
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,720
Go ahead You're on with the president.

680
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,680
Mr. President?

681
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,570
Yes go ahead.

682
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:04,380
You don't know me  my name is Miles Papazian. I work under Karen Hayes.

683
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,040
What is this about?

684
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,310
It's about a recording sir

685
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,900
that Jack Bauer has just delivered here to CTU.

686
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,260
Sir my understanding is it's a recording of a conversation of yours

687
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,330
that if leaked could significantly compromise national security.

688
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,190
Go on.

689
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:31,220
My superior Ms. Hayes  is working with Bauer and Bill Buchanan.

690
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,030
Their intention is to play the recording for the attorney general.

691
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,130
-Why are you telling me this? -Because sir...

692
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,260
I feel compelled to intervene.

693
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,320
And I just I wanted to make sure that you would approve.

694
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,360

702
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,270
Karen wants to know how long before the teleconference starts?

703
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,390

00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,420
