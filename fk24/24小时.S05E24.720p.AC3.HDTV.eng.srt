1
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,300
Coordinates for the targets

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,900
upload them into the missiles.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,200
Begin the launch countdown.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,300
How much time do you need to cancel the launch sequence?

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,000
I won't know for certain till I see how the targeting software is configured.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,400
We're going to keep Bierko and his men out of here,

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,100
so you can finish this.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,300
Ten seconds to launch.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,400
it's done.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,800
The launch sequence is canceled.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,700
You were never really going to let me go, were you?

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,700
No.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,600
You were responsible for the deaths of David Palmer

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,100
and Tony Almeida

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,700
and Michelle Dessler.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,400
I'm going after Logan.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,900
What do you mean,

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,000
"going after Logan"?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,300
I'll fill you in  on the details later.

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,900
Right now, I need you to walk me through modifying some field communications equipment.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,900
Who is this guy?

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,100
Morris O'brian,

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,900
Chloe's ex-husband.

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,500
I need some com unit modifications.

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,900
Can you do that without talking?

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,600
I could,

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,900
but it would be a terrible waste of my charm.

28
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,100
Jack Bauer's on his way here now.

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,200
He's going to confront  your husband directly.

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,800
But Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately.

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
You have to find a way to stall him.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,800
There's a helicopter waiting for me.

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Let it wait.

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,000
I can't.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,300
Yes, you can.

36
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,500
You're the President.

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,300
Aaron said the recording you had implicating the President was destroyed.

38
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,700
Yes.

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,600
Without it, you can't  mount a case.

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,100
I'm working with someone inside ctu.

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,400
They're setting up a digital uplink.

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,500
If I can get Logan to acknowledge everything that he's done today,

43
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,300
it's going to be all the evidence we need.

44
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,100
I need to get on that chopper.

45
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't see how that's gonna be possible.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,500
If Logan doesn't confess,

47
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
how far are you actually willing to go?

48
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,300
As far as I have to.

49
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,300
The following takes place between 6Am and 7Am.

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,800
Here, let me get this for you.

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,100
Watch your hair.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,100
Thank you.

53
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,700
You're welcome.

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,700
I got a flight suit.

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,600
Go ahead.

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,300
Did you make it to the secret service outbuilding?

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,000
I think morris and i may have a way to pull the copilot from the flight.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
What about the reassignment protocol?

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
Working on it.

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
Mike Novick will have to verify the pilot codes.

61
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,200
It should take him about one minute.

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,800
Chloe, hold on a second.

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm switching over to com.

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,500
Okay.

65
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,600
Do you copy?

66
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,100
I'll get back to you as soon as I'm on the chopper.

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,700
Mike Novick's going to call.

68
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,700
Morris.

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,900
Yes, sweetheart?

70
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,700
I need you to do one more thing.

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,900
Some guy from central just called.

72
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,400
Says your packet's messed up.

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I got that straightened out monday.

74
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,500
I guess not.

75
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,400
He wants to talk to you.

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Now?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,900
Right now.

78
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,600
He had me patch you through to the secret service outbuilding.

79
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,500
Mike.

80
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,200
I've delayed him as long as I can.

81
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,500
He'll be there in a few minutes.

82
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,100
Have you heard anything from Jack Bauer yet?

83
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,700
He should be in the secret service outbuilding.

84
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm sending him the necessary documents now.

85
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,700
There's not much time.

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,100
mike.

87
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,000
The reassignment protocol and authorization should be coming through to you.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
He'll need both.

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,400
How are we doing for time?

90
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,300
Hurry.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,300
Hello.

92
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Hello.

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,700
John.

94
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,300
Aaron.

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,900
I thought you transferred out.

96
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,400
Not quite yet.

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,300
Some guy from central called,

98
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
said my packet's all messed...

99
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,200
You will need this.

100
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,700
Don't worry about him.

101
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,600
Carruth has been relieved.

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,700
I guess there was something wrong with his packet.

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,700
Ron Franklin.

104
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,300
There's my protocol.

105
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
This is not bad,

106
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,500
but it needs to be more positive,like,

107
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
Jack Bauer is on the helicopter.

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,700
You have to find an excuse not to get on board.

109
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,400
Charles?

110
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,100
Excuse me.

111
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,400
Could I talk to youfor a second?

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Absolutely.

113
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,400
Will you excuse us for a second?

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,500
I know it sounds silly,

115
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,400
but I didn't bring my medication.

116
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,100
And I just, I just want to have it with me.

117
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,400
Of course. Of course.

118
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,200
We'll send somebody back for it.

119
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,700
No, no, no.

120
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,600
I don't want to delay you.

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
I'll be along later.

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,600
Besides, Charles,

123
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,100
I-I'm thinking that when you land,

124
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
it would be better if I wasn't with you.

125
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,200
Why?

126
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
This is your moment, Charles.

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,300
I-I think that...

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,000
when you step out of that helicopter alone,

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,100
after saving the country,

130
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,700
that is an image that history will never forget.

131
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,600
All right.

132
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,700
Thank you, Marti.

133
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,600
But don't be far behind me, now.

134
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I won't.

135
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,300
Captain.

136
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
I can fly this thing if I have to,

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,700
which leaves you with one of two choices.

138
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
You either do what I say and you live,

139
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,200
or you don't and you die for nothing.

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,700
You understand me?

141
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,100
I want you to wait until I give you my command,

142
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,900
then follow these instructions slowly.

143
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,600
You're going to disconnect your helmet from the communications system.

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,500
Then I want you to rip out the mic cable,

145
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,700
take your helmet off and stow it.

146
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,700
Do it now.

147
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,300
I'll know if you deviate from your flight plan.

148
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,300
Mr. President!

149
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
I have a message for you from the white house!

150
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,300
What the hell are you doing?

151
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,700
Put these on!

152
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,700
You.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
This is Jack.Do you copy?

154
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm here, Jack.

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,600
Where are you?

156
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,300
We just left the ranch.

157
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,500
I have Logan with me.

158
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,400
Is morris standing by with the equipment?

159
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,300
He's on his way.

160
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,700
I'll let him know you're airborne.

161
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,500
Make sure the pilot takes heading 2-8-6 for two miles,

162
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
then breaks south.

163
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,600
Captain!

164
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,900
I want you to follow heading 2-8-6 for two miles,

165
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,200
then break south.

166
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,900
Once you break south,

167
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,400
there should be an industrial park.

168
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,100
There's an abandoned printing press facility that you can use.

169
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll get back to you.

170
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,500
Copy that.

171
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
What are you trying to do, Jack?

172
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,700
Whatever it is,

173
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,600
you know you won't get away with it.

174
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,300
Are you going to kill me?

175
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,900
I suppose you want some sort of revenge.

176
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
I understand that.

177
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,800
Bad things happened.

178
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I didn't want them to happen.

179
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,500
People who worked for me

180
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,800
they-they went too far.

181
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
They did things that they thought I wanted them to do,

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,700
but they were wrong.

183
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,500
You have to understand.

184
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,400
I have always acted in the country'sbest interest.

185
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,300
But you're just trying to get even.

186
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,100
Do you realize what effect this will have on the american people?

187
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,400
This day has been trying enough,

188
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,600
and now the President is being attacked.

189
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,000
If you want to do what's right,

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,700
you will turn this thing around and go back.

191
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,300
Damn it, Bauer, say something!

192
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,700
Hello.

193
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,300
Morris.

194
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,700
Yes, love.

195
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,600
The helicopter is landing in an industrial park one mile due east of where you are.

196
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,500
Head over there.

197
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,800
Okay, now, I give this guy what we worked on,

198
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,100
and then I'm out, right?

199
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,200
Yes, but make sure you have him call me when you do the hand-off.

200
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,900
All right.

201
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,100
Thanks.

202
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,700
Shut it down!

203
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,700
your safety belt.

204
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,700
Move towards the door slowly.

205
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,600
Get out now.

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,300
Move!

207
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,700
Jack, maybe we can work something out.

208
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,600
There's still time.

209
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,700
What do you want?

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
I can help you get away from here with enough money to start a new life,

211
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,300
maybe find that daughter of yours.

212
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,700
Try to work something out.

213
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Whatever you want,it's yours.

214
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,200
You have my word.

215
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
Your word.

216
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,400
Jack, I'm the President of the united states.


218
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm not carrying any weapons.

219
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,300
Don't you make a sound.

220
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,600
Give me the case.

221
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Jack Bauer.

222
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
I should have known that.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Modified equipment.

224
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,500
Oh, that's President Logan,Jack.

225
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,700
Get out of here.

226
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,700
Chloe wants you to call her.

227
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Go.

228
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,300
Yeah, Jack?

229
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,600
I have him.

230
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,500
All right.

231
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,400
I've just checked the response deployment.

232
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,500
You have less than ten minutes until they're on you.

233
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,700
Fine.

234
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,300
Listen, Jack.

235
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,800
I don't mean to put any added pressure on you,

236
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,600
but if you don't have a confession by then,

237
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,400
we'll all be arrested for treason.

238
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,600
Yeah, I know.

239
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,500
Is this some kind of broadcast?

240
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
What is this?

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,700
I would like to know.

242
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,500
Is this an assassination?

243
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,500
A confession.

244
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,100
Don't count on it.

245
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,900
I know you're good at extracting information.

246
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,200
I know that you're good at torture.

247
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,600
I saw what you did with Walt Cummings.

248
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,000
I think you'll be surprised to find out

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,500
that I'm a little tougher than that.

250
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,400
Take a seat.

251
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,900
Chloe, it's Jack.

252
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,500
Can you hear me?

253
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,900
Yeah, Jack.

254
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,500
I want to make sure that you have good reception.

255
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Who you talking to?

256
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,100
Are those your friends at ctu?

257
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,600
You know you're putting them in danger, as well.

258
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,800
Coming through fine, Jack.

259
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
Okay, good.

260
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,500
My people can't be far behind, Jack.

261
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
There's still time to get away.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,100
Take it.

263
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,000
The plan involving the sentox nerve gas,

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,500
it was designed to fool the terrorists and the russians.

265
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Whether or not you formulated the plan is irrelevant.

266
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
You authorized it.

267
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,400
You're delusional.

268
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,500
David Palmer uncovered evidence of this plan.

269
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,500
When he started asking questions,

270
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,200
he was assassinated.

271
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,700
Other people were killed to cover that murder up.

272
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Men and women who served this country with distinction;

273
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,900
people that I worked with;

274
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,800
friends of mine.

275
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,700
No, you're wrong.

276
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,300
This is all a pack of lies.

277
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,200
The terrorists discovered your deception.

278
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,500
And they deployed sentox nerve gas on american soil.

279
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,800
Every american who died today

280
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,900
as a result of terrorist activity

281
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,500
is another murder that you're accountable for.

282
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,600
And before you leave here,

283
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,400
you're going to admit it.

284
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,900
I suppose if you hurt me enough, Jack,

285
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll say whatever you want,

286
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,100
but that won't make it  the truth.

287
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,400
And everybody who watches this will know that perfectly well.

288
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,900
What are the names of your co-conspirators?

289
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,200
There are no co-conspirators,

290
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
because there is no...

291
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
Walt Cummings,

292
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,600
Christopher Henderson,

293
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,200
James Nathanson have all admitted to being part of this conspiracy!

294
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,900
Now they are dead!

295
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,800
Right before Christopher Henderson died

296
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,100
he acknowledged that there were others!

297
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,700
What are their names?

298
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
A man will say anything under torture.

299
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,100
This won't mean a thing.

300
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,400
Mr. Logan, I'm not going to torture you,

301
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,500
but you are going to tell me what I want to know.

302
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,300
Or so help me god,

303
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,500
I will kill you.

304
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,100
A year and a half ago,

305
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,800
I was warned that my life was in danger

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,400
by someone within the government.

307
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,900
I was told the only  way I could stay alive

308
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,600
was to create the illusion that I was dead.

309
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,400
I was forced to deceive people that I loved.

310
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,500
My only daughter will never forgive me.

311
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,300
As I see the depth of your corruption unfold,

312
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,100
I have no doubt that you are that source of danger.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,900
David Palmer was a great man.

314
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
And he was a great President.

315
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,500
He was also my friend.

316
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
He tried to warn me about you

317
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,700
and now he is dead.

318
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,100
Other people tried to help me

319
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,700
and they are dead, too.

320
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,400
So, Mr. Logan,

321
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,500
I hope you understand

322
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,100
I have absolutely nothing to lose.

323
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,800
You are going to be held accountable

324
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,300
for your part of everything that happened today.

325
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
You are not going to be able to hide behind the presidency.

326
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,700
Right here, right now,

327
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,000
you are going to face justice!

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
And make no mistake about this,

329
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,500
this is personal.

330
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,300
And if you think for a second that I am scared to put a bullet in your brain,

331
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,100
you don't know me.

332
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm going to ask you one last time,

333
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,400
who are your co-conspirators?

334
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,500
You have until the count of three,

335
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,700
or I will kill you.

336
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,200
One...

337
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,300
you make me a martyr,

338
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,900
I'll go down in history with lincoln and kennedy,

339
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,300
but you'll go down with john wilkes booth and lee harvey oswald.

340
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,000
Is that what you want?

341
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,100
Two!

342
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,500
You're a man of honor.

343
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,100
How can you assassinate a President of the united states in front of the entire world?

344
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,800
If you love your country,

345
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
you won't pull the trigger.

346
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,400
Three!

347
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,700
You can't do it, can you?

348
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,000
No, Jack,

349
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,900
it's all right.

350
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,100
Jack,

351
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,200
it's all right.

352
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,400
It's all right.

353
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,100
It's all right that you can't.

354
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,500
I'm the President.

355
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,500
Jack, they're here.

356
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,400
Lay flat on your stomach!

357
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
Put your hands out in front of you!

358
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,100
Extend your arms!

359
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,500
Mr. President,are you all right?

360
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
I'm fine.

361
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,700
I actually feel sorry for that man.

362
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,100
He's delusional.

363
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,000
It would be better

364
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,100
if he were put in some sort of solitary confinement for the time being.

365
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,700
Jack Bauer wasn't able to get the President to confess,Mrs. Logan.

366
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,000
Why not?

368
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,900
What happened?

369
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,100
I'm not sure of the details.

370
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,000
Bauer's in custody.

371
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,300
Gentlemen.

372
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,100
Thank you.

373
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,300
Thank you very much,ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
That will be all.

375
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,100
Thank you so much.

376
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,700
-If I could just get you to come this way. -Thank you.

377
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,900
David...

378
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
-Marti, don't do this to me now. -You killed him.

379
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,800
You killed him.

380
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,600
-You're a murderer. -Stop.

381
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,200
You are!

382
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,200
You're a criminal!

383
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,400
My wife is not well.

384
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,600
-Would you please escort her? -Get off me!

385
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,300
Don't you touch me!

386
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,300
-Don't you touch me! -Escort her into the hangar, please.

387
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
You don't know what he did!

388
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,400
He's not fit to be President!

389
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,200
It is a sacrilege for him to be even speaking David's name!

390
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,400
Don't...!No!

391
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,500
I want to make sure that she's all right.

392
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,900
Has the hangar been cleared?

393
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,700
Yes, sir.

394
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,400
All secure.

395
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,300
-It's empty. -Good.

396
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,000
Let them know that I'll be back in a moment.

397
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,200
Yes, Mr. President.

398
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,600
You're not wearing some kind of listening device, are you?

399
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,000
What are you talking about?

400
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,500
I have to watch you now, Marti.

401
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,500
You said that I was a good liar,

402
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,200
but I am nothing compared to you.

403
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,600
Charles...! Stop it!

404
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Stop it!

405
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,600
Charles...

406
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,300
Yeah, Marti.

407
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,900
Tell me the truth.

408
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,800
You're hurting me.

409
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,100
You don't know what pain is.

410
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,300
I'm on to you, Marti.

411
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,200
I should've seen it from the first,

412
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
but I wanted to believe that you still cared for me.

413
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,700
Making love to me was just a ploy, wasn't it?

414
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,800
Took a lot of planning to get Jack Bauer on that helicopter.

415
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,300
You were part of that plan, weren't you?

416
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,300
It was your job to delay me, wasn't it?

417
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,300
Wasn't it?

418
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,100
Please...

419
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,900
wasn't it?

420
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,100
They used you so Jack Bauer could get to me.

421
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,900
Come on, Marti.

422
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,800
Admit it,

423
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,500
you were part of it.

424
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,100
Yes.

425
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,900
Why?

426
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,100
Why...?

427
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,700
Because you killed David Palmer.

428
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,300
I told you I didn't realize that was going to happen.

429
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,000
Your people killed him to protect you.

430
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,800
You covered it up,that's just as bad.

431
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,700
I covered it up because I had to.

432
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,600
Oh, and then others died to cover that up.

433
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,200
That's right, for the good of the country.

434
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
You sold nerve gas to terrorists.

435
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,000
You're insane.

436
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,200
You're insane!

437
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,600
I did it for the good of the country as I saw it at the time.

438
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,700
You're such a hypocrite.

439
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,600
After your little performance this morning,

440
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,500
you're in no position to call me a hypocrite.

441
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,100
And I will tell you something else

442
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,900
if you blow up like this one more time...

443
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,400
I will fill you so full of drugs,

444
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,100
you won't even remember your own name.

445
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,700
And then I will ship you off to an asylum

446
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,100
and you can stay there for the rest of your life.

447
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,200
Are we clear?

448
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,800
Are we clear?

449
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,900
Now clean yourself up,you're a mess.

450
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,600
My fellow americans,

451
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,900
this has been a terrible day in the history of this country

452
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,300
and yet at the same time,

453
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,300
a triumphant day,

454
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,100
because in the end,

455
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,700
we won a significant victory over the forces of chaos and terror.

456
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,500
We have preserved and protected our way of life,

457
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,700
despite the loss of innocent american lives.

458
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,900
I'll start the transmission in one minute.

459
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Is the attorney general there?

460
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,500
I'm here, ms. O'brian.

461
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,300
I certainly hope this recording is as important as you claim it is.

462
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Chloe, what's this about?

463
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,800
I set up a conference call with the attorney general.

464
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,000
He's on speakerphone now.

465
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,900
Are you serious?

466
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm very serious.

467
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,400
Mr. Attorney general,

468
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,300
this is karen hayes,

469
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,100
homeland security.

470
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,300
Bill buchanan, ctu.

471
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,300
Sir, I apologize.

472
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,900
Ms. O'brian placed this call without authorization from me.

473
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm sorry I had to do that.

474
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,300
We had to do things under the radar to protect you all in case things went wrong.

475
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,900
In case what things went wrong?

476
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,900
I think it would help if I just played the recording.

477
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,300
What recording?

478
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,400
It's a conversation that took place five minutes ago

479
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,200
between the President and his wife.

480
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,200
How could you possibly have a recording of something like that?

481
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,000
Sir,

482
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,400
an agent named Jack Bauer

483
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,600
placed a listening device on the President shortly before this conversation.

484
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,700
Bauer?

485
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,100
Isn't he the one that's under arrest?

486
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm going to play the recording now.

487
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,300
I don't want to listen to it.

488
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,300
Ms. O'brian, at the very least,

489
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,700
this constitutes an egregious violation of privacy,

490
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,100
and we're talking about the President.

491
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,900
...'Cause you killed David Palmer.

492
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,400
I told you, I didn't realize that was going to happen.

493
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,200
Your people killed him to protect you.

494
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,000
You covered it up,

495
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,200
that's just as bad.

496
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,900
I covered it up because I had to.

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,900
Oh, and then others died to cover that up!

498
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,500
That's right, for the good of the country.

499
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
You sold nerve gas to terrorists.

500
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,200
You're insane.

501
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
You're insane!

502
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,500
A poet once said,

503
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,600
"No man is an island."

504
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,600
On a day like this,

505
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,500
we can feel the truth of those words.

506
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,200
Any untimely death is a tragedy.

507
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,800
Yet some men embody such greatness of character

508
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,700
that their death serves as a unifying force for those who remain behind.

509
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,900
David Palmer was such a man.

510
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,600
A great President,

511
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,300
a great american

512
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,500
and on a more personal note

513
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
a wonderful friend.

514
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,900
He'll be missed...

515
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,300
-...more than words can express... -Holtzman.

516
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,100
Yes, sir.

517
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,500
We take this moment to remember with appreciation...

518
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,700
with all due respect,Mr. Attorney general,

519
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,600
are you sure this isn't some kind of mistake?

520
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,400
Yes, sir.

521
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
I understand, sir.

522
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,700
-I'll do exactly as you say. -...Combination of wisdom,

523
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,600
strength and moral courage,

524
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,900
this country might have not survived in its present form.

525
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,500
It's very appropriate that David Palmer will be laid to rest in arlington cemetery,

526
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,500
for he was a soldier in the truest sense.

527
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,500
He was a man whose courage rose in direct proportion to the threats his country faced.

528
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,100
In closing, I would ask

529
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,900
that the country observe a national day of mourning

530
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,500
for one of the greatest americans this nation will ever see.

531
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
Thank you very much.

532
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,600
Federal marshall.

533
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,500
-Would you please come with us? -What the hell do you think you're doing?

534
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,800
You came very close to disrupting my speech.

535
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,200
On behalf of President Logan,

536
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,900
I wish to thank you all very much for joining us.

537
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,300
I am sorry, but out of respect for today's...

538
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,700
those are ridiculous accusations.

539
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,700
Excuse me.

540
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,000
If I may, sir?

541
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,500
You've probably never seen one of these, Mr. President.

542
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,800
It's a micro-transmitter.

543
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
Agent clark, arrest these men

544
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,400
and get them the hell out of here.

545
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,700
I'm sorry Mr. President.

546
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,200
-We have our orders. -You take...!

547
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,900
You take your orders from me.

548
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,000
Not anymore.

549
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,600
After you, sir.

550
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,400
Attention!

551
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,700
Aim,fire!

552
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,900
Attention!

553
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
Aim,fire!

554
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,100
Attention!

555
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,500
Aim,fire!

556
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Give me a second.

557
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
-Hey. -Hey.

558
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,800
Thank god you're safe.

559
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,200
Everything's going to be all right.

560
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,000
Jack, when I heard you kidnapped the President...

561
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,700
I was just trying to get him to give me a direct confession.

562
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,600
Jack...

563
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,000
how much longer do you need to stay here?

564
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,100
Not much longer.

565
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,300
They can debrief me tomorrow.

566
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,300
You sure?

567
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,600
I can't believe you're really,

568
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,200
you're really here.

569
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,600
Agent Bauer,excuse me,

570
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,300
but there's a call for you from your daughter.

571
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,800
From my daughter?

572
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,700
Yes, sir. A kim Bauer.

573
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,400
It's been put through to a land line just inside that door.

574
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,200
Thank you.

575
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,600
I'll be right back.I promise.

576
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,200
Take as long as you need.

577
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm not going anywhere.

578
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,400
I love you.

579
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,600
I'll be right back.

580
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,100
Hey, kim?

581
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,700
Any word on Logan?

582
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,800
No.

583
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,400
My guess is he'll try to cut a deal.

584
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,600
He'll resign without a fight in exchange for clemency.

585
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
He doesn't deserve clemency.

586
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,400
No, but the country doesn't deserve a long impeachment process,

587
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,200
either,with everything that's happened.

588
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,500
In any event,

589
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,000
we can expect hal gordon to be sworn in as President soon.

590
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,900
Which means this will probably be the last time I see this place.

591
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't think so.

592
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,900
Not if I have anything to do with it,

593
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,600
and I will.

594
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,300
You'll be back here running ctu.

595
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,800
Thank you.I appreciate that.

596
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,600
When I came in here last night to save the day,

597
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,500
I was a little bit condescending and tactless,

598
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
to say the least.

599
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I had no idea what you were up against.

600
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
I'm sorry.

601
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,300
No. No need to apologize.

602
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,800
Mistakes were made.

603
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,900
You were right to come in with a firm hand.

604
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,500
Well, I better go.

605
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,300
Karen.

606
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,900
I was thinking of getting some breakfast before going home.

607
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,300
I have to go over to division for one last briefing.

608
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Bureaucracy.

609
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
Rain check?

610
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,000
Sure.

611
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,500
Chloe,really good work today.

612
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,500
You, too.

613
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,000
I found this in edgar's possessions.

614
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,400
I thought you should have it.

615
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,700
Thanks.

616
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,100
Hey.

617
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,500
What's all this, then?

618
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,000
A friend of mine who died today.

619
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,800
You, um,

620
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,100
do you want to talk about it?

621
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,100
Yeah? Come on.

622
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,800
Jack?

623
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,100
Oh, my god.

624
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,300
Agent davis,Jack Bauer's missing!

625
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,800
Attention, all units.

626
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,600
We have a missing agent:Jack Bauer.

627
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,100
I repeat, we have a missing agent: Jack Bauer.

628
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,800
...The lower level.

629
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,500
Put three men on perimeter search.

630
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,500
Report back.

631
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,000
You surely must be aware, Mr. Bauer,

632
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,600
that China has a long memory.

633
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,400
Only 18 months ago,

634
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,600
you invaded our territory and killed our consul.

635
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,700
Did you really think that we would forget, hmm?

636
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,800
I know how this works.

637
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,200
I need to make one phone call.

638
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,700
Please...

639
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,700
just one phone call.

640
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,200
Kill me.

641
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,600
Just...

642
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,300
kill me.

643
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,700
Kill you?

644
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,000
You're far too valuable to kill, Mr. Bauer.
