1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,800
I'm reprogramming a ctu key car right now.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,100
Good.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,600
Our couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,300
They'll be in place soon.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,200
When are you launching your attacks?

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,600
After you're done at ctu.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,000
When these terrorists attack

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,300
you're going to need to maintain order.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,300
I believe we should be thinking of a preemptive declaration of martial law.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,900
In the greater los angeles area.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,400
If ctu can't find this man Bierko

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,300
we're gonna get hit.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive?

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,500
If you knew I was alive

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,600
you would have been at risk

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,300
and I had no choice.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm happy that you're alive I am

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
but I can't give you what you want right now.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,800
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,600
To supply terrorists with sentox nerve gas.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,000
Who's behind it?

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,900
Christopher Henderson.

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,100
Whatever he's not telling us is important.

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,000
And he's willing to tolerate an inhuman amount of pain.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,700
Thousands of lives are at stake.

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,850
There is enough time for you to tell me

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,000
what I need to know to stop this insanity please.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,700
I'm sorry guy

29
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,600
but I can't tell you what you want to know.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,700
this is bauer.

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,800
We've been compromised.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Someone used a stolen key card to access ctu less than an hour ago.

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,600
Freeze.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,500
Drop the gun.

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,800
Bill it's Jack.

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,500
I think he tried to deploy nerve gas throughout the building.

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Code six everybody out.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,900
Go go.

39
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,600
Seal all the rooMs.

40
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,500
Oh no.

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,600
My god.

42
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,600
Chloe.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,600
The following takes place between 7Pm and 8Pm

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,300
Atention all ctu personnel.

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,200
This facility has been contaminated with sentox vx-1 nerve gas.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,900
Repeat: This facility has been contaminated.

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,500
There are two safe zones on the main floor

48
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
the situation room and medical.

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,700
On the second floor

50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,500
the safe zones are the CTU direct's office and holding room four.

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,700
These areas will remain sealed

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,900
pending the arrival of the chemical response team.

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,200
If you are in any of these sealed areas

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,300
do not attempt to leave until the crt clears the environment.

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
I'm on my way

56
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,450
but it could take 20 to 30 minutes to

57
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,200
gather all the crt personnel you'll need.

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
I understand curtis

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,100
but we need crt here now.

60
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
This is a high priority.

61
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,600
Get here as fast as you can.

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,400
All right copy

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,600
I'll call you in a few minutes with updates

64
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,700
this is bauer.

65
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,800
Jack it's Bill.

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,100
I just talked to curtis.

67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,300
He's with the chemical response team.

68
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,500
They won't be able to get here for at least 30 minutes.

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,800
Why not?

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
Most of their units were sent to Tyler Memorial.

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
The rest are en route to high probability targets.

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
Okay we're going to keep working here.

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,300
Our networks are still up right?

74
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,800
Yeah the phones are working the computers are up.

75
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,600
I can coordinate with division from here.

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
What do you need where you are?

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
I need to know if Henderson still alive.

78
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,500
Where is he?

79
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Agent burke was trsferring him over to the isolation clic in medical.

80
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,900
I don'know if they made it before the barriers went down.

81
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
You can tell if you pull up a building grid.

82
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,800
What about ctu's chemical response plan?

83
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Gas masks are in the armory

84
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,200
atropine is in medical storage.

85
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Both areas are contaminated.

86
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
We can't get to them without being exposed to the gas.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,600
Bill I'm going to have to get right back to you.

88
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,600
Chloe...

89
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,400
I know how difficult this is for you right now

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
but there's nothing we can do for him.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,600
I need you to come back to work.

92
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,200
Well at least tell me how to pull up a building grid.

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll do it myself.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,200
Jack we can try to pull it up.

95
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
Get started.

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,300
Chloe ctu is immobile right now.

97
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,700
Everything is going to go through comm.

98
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,900
That's you.

99
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,000
I need you back at work.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
I can't.

101
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,300
Yes you can.

102
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,000
No I can't.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
Yes you can.

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
Mr. Bauer.

105
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,600
What?

106
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,500
I can help her.

107
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I'm a clinical psychologist.

108
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,400
Thank you.

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,500
Chloe

110
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,400
my name is Dr. Landes.

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,300
Now he was a friend of yours

112
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,200
what was his name?

113
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,800
Edgar.

114
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,100
I'd like you to turn away from edgar and focus on me please.

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,800
Chloe you're in shock

116
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
and I'd like to help you through it.

117
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
The only thing I'm going to ask you to do is sit in this chair

118
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
and collect your breath.

119
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Let's do that now.

120
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,700
Just collect your breath

121
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,600
just for a second.

122
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,800
He was such a good guy.

123
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,400
I just treated him like crap all day.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
This is my fault.

125
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,200
Sir?

126
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,800
Someone stole my key card and used it to get into the building.

127
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,200
It was missing

128
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,200
and I didn't say anything.

129
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,700
Why not?

130
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,000
I thought they just stole my wallet for the money.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,200
How could you not report it?

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,500
I was embarrassed.

133
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,400
I didn't want anyone to know I got beat up.

134
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
So we're all going to die

135
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,600
because you were embarrassed?

136
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,100
Mr. Almeida what are you doing?

137
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,200
I want to know what's going on.

138
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,400
No I can't allow that.

139
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,700
I'm not sitting in this damn bed while ctu is under attack

140
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,600
got it?

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Fine.

142
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
How long are we supposed to be sectioned off like this?

143
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,500
I haven't received any news.

144
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,200
Oh my god.

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,400
Jack we've got the building grid.

146
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,900
Buchanan.

147
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,800
Bill it's Jack

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,700
the grid's up.

149
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
All right

150
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,600
check the isolation zones that have logged in.

151
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,700
You'll have survivors.

152
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,400
Two zones have logged on in medical.

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,500
Try them.

154
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,300
I'm going to keep this line open.

155
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,500
Okay hold on.

156
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,700
Clinic.

157
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,100
Dr. Besson it's Jack bauer.

158
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,500
Jack what's going on?

159
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
One of the terrorists infiltrated ctu

160
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,000
and deployed a canister of sentox nerve gas through the ventilation system.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,300
That's why we needed to seal off as many rooms as possible.

162
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,700
I need to know if agent burke got to medical with Henderson.

163
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Yes he did.

164
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,800
Henderson's here right now?

165
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,000
Tony is that you?

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,400
Jack how much longer are we going to be locked down?

167
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,300
Right now we're in standby

168
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,200
we're trying to figure out how to clean out the air supply.

169
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,600
Dr. Besson?

170
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Tony.

171
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,100
T me a security feed over at medical.

172
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,600
Jack I don't think this program is set ufor that.

173
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,500
Try a redirect.

174
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
All ght.

175
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,200
Dr. Besson.

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,500
What are you doing?

177
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,600
Move aside.

178
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
All right, I've got a video.

179
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,700
My god he's got a gun.

180
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,400
Patch me through to their intercom.

181
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Do it.

182
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,300
We'll be able to hear them

183
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,500
but they can't hear us yet.

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
You can't kill him.

185
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,000
He's got information we need.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,700
He killed my wife.

187
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,200
Tony please don't kill him.

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Move aside Rick.

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,300
I don't want to shoot you but I will.

190
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,500
Move it.

191
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,500
You remember me?

192
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,500
My name is Tony Almeida.

193
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,100
You killed my wife Michelle dessler this morning.

194
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
He's going to kill him hurry.

195
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,700
Hurry.

196
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,000
She was my life

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
and you took her.

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,500
And now I'm going to take yours.

199
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,400
I got it.

200
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,200
Tony it's Jack.

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
I've got you on the security feed.

202
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,100
Stay out of this Jack.

203
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,800
Tony please just listen to me.

204
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,500
You can't do this.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,400
I know how you feel right now.

206
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,200
I lost terry the exact same way

207
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,900
to one of our own.

208
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,600
I know what it feels to be betrayed like this.

209
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
But Tony

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Henderson has information that can save thousands and thousands of lives.

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,900
And I know that doesn't make you feel better right now

212
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,600
but I know you Tony.

213
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,300
I know you don't want to make this situation any worse than it is.

214
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,200
Please?

215
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,500
Please just let us finish our interrogation.

216
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,600
Hurry up.

217
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,600
Agent burke please continue.

218
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,200
We have to get him talking.

219
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,400
He's our only lead to Bierko and the rest of the sentox canisters

220
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,500
and how we can find Bierko.

221
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Tell me where to find Bierko.

222
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,000
Where?

223
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
Nowhere.

224
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,200
What is your computer password?

225
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,500
No.

226
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,500
I know no password.

227
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,650
Agent burke can we increase the dose

228
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,960
Not without killing him.

229
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,950
Okay take a short break and then start again.

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,840
Get back to me as soon as you've got anything.

231
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes sir.

232
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,020
How could ctu have been hit?

233
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,800
We're not sure Mr. Vice president.

234
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,510
Are you telling me they didn't have any safeguards in place?

235
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,260
They had partial containment

236
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,660
but our early reports indicate that 40% of their personnel have been taken out

237
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,190
You mean they've been killed?

238
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,100
We're afraid so sir.

239
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,810
Ctu is protecting this city.

240
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,490
Are you saying they're no longer capable of doing that?

241
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,980
I'm saying they've been seriously compromised yes.

242
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,960
So what are we going to do Ms. Hayes?

243
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,450
We've got terrorists with nerve gas canisters out there.

244
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,770
Who is going to stop them?

245
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,100
Mr. President I suggest an emergency restructuring.

246
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,210
Meaning what?

247
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,240
Meaning that the chemical response team will go in neutralize the nerve gas at ctu

248
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,990
and I will take a team in there and personally manage the operation.

249
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,020
How soon can you do that?

250
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,380
Within the hour.

251
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,110
Fine. Do it.

252
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,210
Yes sir.

253
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,050
All right they're still somewhat operational. It's not a complete disaster.

254
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,100
Mr. President it is.

255
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,250
I can see no other option right now

256
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,970
but to impose martial law on the city of los angeles.

257
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,720
Hal my advisors believe if the military takes over the streets

258
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,400
and starts detaining people it could create mayhem.

259
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,410
Sir it's only a matter of time before me canisters are released

260
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,390
in public places and then you will have mayhem.

261
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,580
Except without the soldiers you'll need to contain it.

262
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,600
So what do I tell the public?

263
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,560
That we've got nerve gas canisters all over the city

264
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
but we don't know where they are? .

265
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,830
No no you don't have to get into that.

266
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,150
Tie it to that earlier incident at the airport.

267
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,900
I'm going to get resistance from all sides.

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,150
That's true sir.

269
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,220
We may have to swallow some saltwater but wouldn't it be worth it

270
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,870
if we can keep the people off the streets

271
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,130
safe from another public attack?

272
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,900
I don't know Hal.

273
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,370
Sir consider this

274
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,470
if we clear the streets of everybody except the military

275
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,750
these terrorists won't be able to move as freely as they are right now.

276
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,620
We have to do whatever we can to stop the people behind this.

277
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,390
Ctu is no longer an obstacle.

278
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,610
At least for the time being.

279
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,630
Good.

280
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,210
Have our men move from their current positions and go to the new target.

281
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,190
How much of the nerve gas will they release there?

282
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,500
All of it.

283
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,500
Excuse me.

284
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,250
Chloe are you ready to go back to work?

285
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,940
What do you need?

286
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,030
I need you. We can't break Henderson.

287
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,570
I need you to keep trying to decrypt the files that we took from his computer.

288
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,440
I already tried that. It didn't work. Maybe somebody else could do it.

289
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,910
Chloe you're the only person in the room qualified.

290
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,470
Chloe please. Don't shut down on me now.

291
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,950
I'm upset about everything that's happening too

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,410
but you know how things work around here.

293
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,390
We do not quit until it's over.

294
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,100
You're not helping her. You're just making things worse.

295
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,860
I am sure that you are qualified to

296
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,950
help someone through this kind of distress over an extended period of time

297
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,310
but you see we do not have an extended period of time.

298
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,810
So if you don't mind stepping aside so I can do my job I would appreciate it.

299
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,710
Believe it or not Jack you don't have to be qualified to help people.

300
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,460
You just have to be there for them.

301
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,220
Like you were there for my daughter.

302
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,900
What does that mean?

303
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,530
You're 20 years older than she is.

304
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,150
I know exactly what you're doing.

305
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,870
I've done nothing but try and help her deal with her loss.

306
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,010
How dare you accuse me of taking advantage of her.

307
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,810
You did...

308
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,270
dad stop. You can be angry at me all you want

309
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,000
but before I met barry I didn't want to live. Do you understand that?

310
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,300
Fine I'll get back to work if everyone could just relax.

311
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,680
Jack we have a problem.

312
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,160
What?

313
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,300
Chloe I just saw the alarm. What's going on?

314
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,000
The seal pressure indicators in the contaminated zones

315
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,150
are showing traces of sublimated polymer near the partition seal.

316
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,360
What does that mean?

317
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,460
It means that the nerve gas must be mixed with a corrosive agent an acid.

318
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,190
The acid's breaking down the seal between the rooMs.

319
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,570
How long till the seal fails completely?

320
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,110
It's hard to say for sure.

321
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,280
Can you give me an estimate?

322
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,150
It's deteriorating quickly. I'd say 15 minutes 20 at the most.

323
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,520
And then what?

324
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,920
As soon as the gas permeates the seal it enters the room. Then it's over.

325
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,510
Get me schematics on all the isolated zones.

326
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,690
Mr. Vice president with all due respect

327
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,670
I'm not trying to usurp your position.

328
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm simply trying to serve the president the best way I can.

329
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,460
Yes sir.

330
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,530
What was that about?

331
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,300
I was trying to convince Gardner

332
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,580
to let me help him draft the president's statement.

333
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,000
Charles is letting Hal write his statement?

334
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,850
He's insisted.

335
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,620
And the president gave him the go-ahead.

336
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,170
But that means Gardner is effectively making policy.

337
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,650
We've got to stop him.

338
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,230
I'm trying.

339
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,640
But you know what kind of pressure the president's under today.

340
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,470
He wants all the counsel he can get.

341
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,190
And Hal's only too eager to help out.

342
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,940
Of course he's too eager. He's got his eye on the oval office.

343
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,360
Anything he can do to speed up Charles' down fall

344
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,380
puts him one step closer to the presidency

345
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,020
Martha you have to intervene.

346
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,710
Hal feeds the president ideas.

347
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,290
We saw it at the WTO we saw it in Chicago. When they work.

348
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,820
Hal takes the credit for them.

349
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,150
When they don't the president takes the hits.

350
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,850
Have you reminded Charles of that?

351
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,280
I can't. Hal's the vice president.

352
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,950
I'm just the chief of staff.

353
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,380
You have influence that supercedes any constitutional rank.

354
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,820
And now's the time to use it.

355
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,250
I want to see the statement as soon as it's issued.

356
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,550
You will.

357
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,020
I just checked the readings from all uncontaminated zones.

358
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,830
The testing you've been doing in your respective areas is consistent.

359
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,430
The sentox nerve gas that was released into

360
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,400
the air duct system contains a corrosive agent

361
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,900
that is eating away at the barrier seals protecting the safe zones.

362
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,960
I'm not going to pull any punches.

363
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,790
Crt will not be here to help us.

364
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,330
At this point our only hope is to help ourselves.

365
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,000
We need to find a way to either neutralize

366
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,640
or flush the sentox out of the contaminated areas

367
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,790
before the barrier seals fail and the gas enters the safe zones.

368
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,910
I want all personnel working on this problem.

369
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,900
We don't have much time. Do what you can.

370
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,510
We'll hope for the best.

371
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,450
Maybe we can do something from in here.

372
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,690
Access the ventilation system?

373
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,750
Even if I could it doesn't mean

374
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,350
we could do anything to stop the seals from breaking down.

375
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,600
Just try.

376
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,300
Maybe it's not as bad as we think. Maybe the numbers are off.

377
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,510
They're not.

378
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:04,710
Even if the seals leak crt could get here in time.

379
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,300
The only reason she's here is because I asked her to stay.

380
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,050
If something happens to her it's going to be because of me...

381
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,240
Because of what I did.

382
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,210
There was no way that you could know that ctu was vulnerable.

383
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,500
Jack.

384
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,570
You've got something?

385
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,680
I think if I can slow the seals from breaking down

386
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,570
I can flush the contaminated areas using the air conditioning.

387
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,360
Do it.

388
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,510
Something's wrong. The control isn't responding.

389
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,340
Why not?

390
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,900
It's being blocked by some program that I can't get to remotely.

391
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,150
It's probably on a computer near holding four.

392
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,030
Can you get me how can I get in there?

393
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,750
This is a false wall. The air in there is not contaminated.

394
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,370
Can he get to the computer through there?

395
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,170
Yes but once he makes it through the safe zone he'll be in a contaminated area.

396
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,260
What are you talking about? He can't go through a contaminated area.

397
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,360
I can hold my breath.

398
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,170
The sentox won't be absorbed by my skin over that short a period of time.

399
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,130
As long as I don't in hale it I'll be fine.

400
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,810
Jack you can't hold your breath that long.

401
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,110
I only have to hold my breath long enough to get to the computer

402
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,820
disconnect the program and get back to the ventilated room.

403
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,140
Once I'm back in the safe room how long will it take you to clear out the sentox

404
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,420
About 20 seconds based on the cubic footage.

405
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,470
Jack even if you get to the computer what if we can't ventilate that room

406
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,250
Chloe thinks we can.

407
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,720
Right now this is our only option. Crt is not going to get here in time.

408
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,640
The seals are now 80% gone.

409
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,860
What's the bottom line?

410
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,850
We have less than 20 minutes.

411
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,550
All right Jack Chloe and i are on channel one.

412
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,110
If you need to communicate with anyone else we'll patch you through.

413
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,580
As soon as I go through you have to replace this behind me.

414
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,290
Jack it's time. Go now.

415
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,940
Now.

416
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,730
Chloe it's Jack.

417
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,130
I just completed the airlock.

418
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,240
I'm getting ready to move into the ventilation room.

419
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,360
I'll tap my com unit three times when I'm back in the safe room.

420
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,370
All right.

421
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,630
Jack I don't have to remind you if that airlock leaks

422
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,940
we'll all be dead within the next three minutes.

423
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,150
It's not going to leak Chloe.

424
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,720
Okay...

425
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,110
- I'm going in. - Okay.

426
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,530
seal corrosion is now at 86 percent.

427
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,790
Is there anything we can do from here?

428
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,740
No we just have to wait.

429
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,440
There's nothing we can do to get your dad out any faster.

430
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,600
Don't talk down to me Chloe.

431
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,850
Listen we're in a crisis situation here okay?

432
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,880
Tempers are bound to flare. Let's just everybody breathe.

433
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,700
What's with you and the breathing?

434
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,490
Is that your solution to everything?

435
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,150
It's Jack he's back in the room.

436
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,560
It's too soon he couldn't have found the program and disabled it yet.

437
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,790
He's got 15 more seconds before the room clears.

438
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,270
What's it mean that he finished so quickly?

439
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,260
I don't know.

440
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,720
Well it could be a good thing right?

441
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,200
It should be a good thing or it could be a bad thing.

442
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,340
That's what "I don't know" means.

443
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,050
All right Jack the room is clear you can breathe. Are you okay?

444
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,890
I couldn't get to it.

445
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,570
Chloe you're right. I saw it.

446
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,090
There's a computer program running on the ac control unit

447
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,770
but there's a security grate in the wall behind the vent.

448
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,360
I don't see it on my system.

449
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,750
Trust me it's there.

450
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,620
I just found it.

451
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,460
It was a security upgrade in the last two years.

452
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,200
Somebody didn't file it properly that's why I didn't see it.

453
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,720
Are there any other vents that could help us get into that wall?

454
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,460
No they've all been upgraded.

455
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,780
Well it's a room there's got to be a door. Where does it lead?

456
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,480
To a corridor above holding four.

457
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,520
None of us can get there from where we're at.

458
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,100
Who's in holding room four?

459
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,390
Lynn Mcgill.

460
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,780
Are there any other vented rooms we can get him to?

461
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,250
No Jack there's nothing.

462
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,240
Patch me through to him.

463
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,800
Mcgill here.

464
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,240
Lynn it's Jack.

465
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,990
We found a computer interrupt in the ac control unit.

466
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,120
Now if we can shut that down in the next few minutes

467
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,040
we can stop the gas from permeating the safe zones.

468
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,880
Well that's good news.

469
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,580
The problem is you're the only person close enough to get to it.

470
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,990
Chloe?

471
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,230
It's directly above the holding room where you are now.

472
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,290
Take the stairs

473
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,500
go to the left around the corner. It's the room on your left.

474
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,590
Okay...

475
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,190
how are we going to do this Jack?

476
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,180
Lynn the truth is if I can get there

477
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,910
I would do this myself but I'm not close enough.

478
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,800
No one who's still alive in ctu is. You're the only person who can do this.

479
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,160
And I'm going to have to ask you to do it without any protection.

480
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,050
I see.

481
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,330
No you don't.

482
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,830
As soon as you open the door to the hallway your room will become contaminated.

483
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,850
You can hold your breath long enough to fix the problem

484
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,800
but we have nowhere else to send you.

485
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,360
We can't airlock you.

486
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,480
There are two of us in here Jack.

487
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,160
Sir this is Harry Swinton.

488
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,080
So you're saying that if he does this then we're both gonna die?

489
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,070
I'm so sorry.

490
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,230
We don't have a choice Harry.

491
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,690
How do we know that you're not just making this story up

492
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,890
so you don't have to make the sacrifice yourself?

493
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,530
You don't.

494
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,640
All I can ask you to do is believe me. I'm telling you the truth.

495
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,600
Well that's easy for you to say sir. You're not the one who's about to die.

496
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,020
It's not easy for me to say.

497
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,860
Hold on.

498
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,190
We have to do this Harry.

499
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,410
We're going to die anyway.

500
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,680
If we don't so will everyone in ctu.

501
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,870
We have to do this.

502
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,090
Okay Jack go ahead.

503
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,170
Once you enter the ventilation room

504
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,200
the computer will be on your right.

505
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,020
There's a program running on the computer.

506
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,270
You need to quit out of it I'll take it from there.

507
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,110
Lynn we don't have a lot of time.

508
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,050
I'll do it.

509
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,020
Chloe...

510
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,250
I'm sorry about how I acted earlier...

511
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,880
and about yo friend that died.

512
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,760
Okay. Thanks.

513
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,080
I've been wanting to ask you something.

514
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,000
Did you have contact with my dad while he was gone?

515
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,710
I sent him information about once a month.

516
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,150
What kind of information?

517
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
A lot of different things.

518
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,760
About me?

519
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,160
Actually almost all of it was about you.

520
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,500
Your breakup with chase your depression...

521
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,670
wha... ?  How did you get... ?

522
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,790
I'm really good at getting information.

523
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,260
I don't judge it I just pass it on.

524
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,940
I'm sorry about you and chase. It must've been really painful.

525
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,790
Yeah it was.

526
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,010
So you talked to him too?

527
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,580
Chase?  No.

528
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,190
You know where he is?

529
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,300
No but I could find out if you want.

530
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,550
No no it's all right.

531
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,560
Barry thinks I shou let that go.

532
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,800
He's probably right.

533
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,890
Yeah well shrinks are always giving advice

534
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,990
that they probably don't follow themselves.

535
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,090
How are you doing?

536
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,680
Well this morning woke up with a guy in my bed

537
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,190
that I'll probably never see again.

538
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,800
And I just watched one of my best friends die right in front of me

539
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,380
so... I guess not that great.

540
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,980
Yeah.

541
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,030
Replace the panel.

542
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,270
Pull up the security feed for the observation room.

543
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,900
You be a good girl for mommy okay?

544
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,630
She tells you you have to go to bed you have to go to bed.

545
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,170
When you coming home?

546
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,640
I don't know honey.

547
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,460
If I fall asleep will you wake me up?

548
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,040
Of course I will.

549
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,180
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

550
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,450
I'm going in now Harry.

551
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,890
Say good-bye.

552
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,520
I love you.

553
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,620
Love you to daddy.

554
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,010
Bye baby girl.

555
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,150
Chloe we're ready.

556
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,750
I'm going in.

557
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,430
Okay good luck. And thanks for doing this.

558
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,520
Yeah.

559
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,430
He did it.

560
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,960
Is the ac responding?

561
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,440
Yes. I'm starting the fans now.

562
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
How long before the sentox is neutralized?

563
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,370
At least 15 minutes but the concentration should go down enough to stop

564
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,420
eating away at the seals immediately.

565
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,870
Polymer count is down

566
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,570
it looks like the seals will hold until all zones are clear.

567
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,600
Lynn Harry I don't know if you can still hear me

568
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,070
but I want you to know what you did was successful.

569
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,170
The seals are holding.

570
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,440
I will personally notify your familiesand tell them of the sacrifice you made.

571
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,350
I'm so sorry.

572
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,300
I don't know what else to say.

573
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,030
Thank you.

574
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,600
I'm okay...

575
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,800
I'm okay.

576
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,880
Pull up the security feed to medical.

577
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,810
Can you hear me?

578
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,120
What's your name?

579
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,550
No...

580
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,080
no name.

581
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,660
You're wasting your time.

582
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,440
Agent burke this is Jack bauer.

583
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,870
What have you got from Henderson?

584
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,170
Nothing. He's still not talking.

585
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,530
Okay keep working on him.

586
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,670
As soon as the barriers go up I'll get back to you.

587
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,960
Chloe

588
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,240
I don't think we're going to break Henderson now.

589
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,100
All the information that we're going to get is from his computer.

590
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,930
I need you to keep working on those files.

591
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,840
Most of my team is gone. How am I going to do that?

592
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,760
Only work on his files.

593
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,630
Kim

594
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,270
as soon as the barriers go up I want you go over to medical

595
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,350
and let them check you out.

596
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,450
No dad when the barriers go up I'm leaving.

597
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,270
Kim please just do this for me.

598
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,350
We still need to talk.

599
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,210
There's nothing to talk about.

600
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,800
Don't be in such a hurry to cut me off.

601
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,270
You cut me off.

602
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,270
Listen to me I'm not angry.

603
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,790
I love you.

604
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:48,140
But there's nothing left to say except I don't want to be around you.

605
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,570
Every time I am something horrible happens. People die

606
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,680
and I know that's not your fault but I can't be a part of it.

607
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,560
I don't want you to be a part of that.

608
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:06,300
All I want is for one day you and I just to be able to spend time together.

609
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,630
Kim I had to give you up once I'm not going to let that happen again.

610
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,780
Dad...

611
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,180
I can't.

612
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,160
- God that was close. - I know.

613
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,050
Are you all right?

614
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,670
No.

615
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,650
An emergency peacekeeping force.

616
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,150
It was Hal's suggestion.

617
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,210
I think it works.

618
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,380
Charles

619
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,230
aren't you afraid that an edict of this kind could do far more damage

620
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,020
than any chemical weapon ever could?

621
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,520
Martha ctu has been attacked.

622
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,640
Our first line of defense is shut down

623
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,530
and people were killed because of this chemical weapon.

624
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,020
And that's just a prelude to what's going to happen in this city

625
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,440
more nerve gas will be released I can guarantee it.

626
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,000
Look if you or Mike you have any better ideas please

627
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,750
I would be glad to hear them.

628
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,410
- I can break a moment.  - Certenly.

629
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,070
What is it martha?

630
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,790
If you

631
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,670
Charles logan really feel

632
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,680
that martial law is your only option

633
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,410
I will support you.

634
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,860
But what I will not do

635
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,570
is stand by and watch Hal Gardner use you

636
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,970
to promote his own agenda.

637
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,200
Please martha give me some credit.

638
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,820
He has done it before.

639
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,960
He is not the president.

640
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,760
You are.

641
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,970
I am doing this because it's the right thing to do.

642
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,360
I don't know how much more of this I can take

643
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,330
I real don't.

644
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,110
David's assination the nerve gas

645
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,300
the murder of those hostages walt cummings' betrayal

646
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,820
and you...

647
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,240
I almost lost you.

648
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,600
I didn't lose you did I?

649
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,690
No Charles.

650
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,440
You didn't lose me.

651
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,210
I'm still here.

652
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,450
Yes.

653
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,500
Good.

654
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,130
The men are there. They need the schematics.

655
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,760
Who is it?

656
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,670
Just a client.

657
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,800
Yes.

658
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,590
Have you got it yet?

659
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,480
I told you I'd call you as soon as I have everything.

660
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,400
I'm still waiting on a few items.

661
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,310
I'm paying you a lot of money Collette.

662
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,870
And if you could have gotten the detailed specs

663
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,170
of a facility this secure from someone else you would have.

664
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,420
But you didn't.

665
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,420
You called me and I'll have it for you in a few minutes.

666
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,760
What's wrong?

667
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,450
Nothing.

668
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,280
Difficult client.

669
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,680
Wish I knew exactly what it is you did.

670
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,600
I might be able to help.

671
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,720
You do help me.

672
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,740
Oh I can't.

673
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,790
I have to go and finish something.

674
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,290
Finish this.

675
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,780
How long till the air will be safe to breathe?

676
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,630
all right thank you very much.

677
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,790
Buchanan.

678
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,480
Mr. Buchanan this is Karen Hayes from homeland security.

679
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,300
Karen.

680
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,420
I'm running a damage assessment and I need your body count.

681
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,950
We don't have a body count yet.

682
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,750
We'll know more when crt gets here and the barriers lift.

683
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,720
What's your best estimate?

684
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,020
I'm guessing we'll need at least 20 in comm

685
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,660
and 35 in tactical and other departments.

686
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,290
All right well I'm on my way over there with a core team.

687
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,380
We can make adjustments when I get there.

688
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,480
You coming here now?

689
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,830
Yes.

690
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,060
I see.

691
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,700
I'll be there soon.

692
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,790
How's your progress?

693
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,580
Good.

694
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,130
I've already reformatted their main servers to our specs.

695
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,560
All their tactical protocols will have to go through me.

696
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,290
Good.

697
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,490
I may have to replace some of their personnel with my people.

698
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,840
Do you have a problem with that?

699
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,420
Absolutely not.

700
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,120
After what these people have been through

701
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,700
most of them won't be up to full capacity.

702
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,050
We need to identify these people quickly and send them home.

703
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,970
What about chain of command?

704
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,700
Am I going to need approval from Bill Buchanan

705
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,360
if I want to make a personnel change?

706
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,190
No Bill won't be in charge when we get there

707
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,830
I will.

708
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,320
For all intents and purposes ctu is no longer an operation entity.

709
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,010
It's a building with workers who will report to us.

710
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,930
We're clear. I'm going back to medical.

711
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,180
Kim

712
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,110
I have to finish this now.

713
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,110
I know. Good-bye dad.

714
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,690
Good-bye

715
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,950
Excuse me Jack.

716
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,040
I just wanted to say thank you

717
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,930
for saving our lives.

718
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,200
I mean we definitely couldn't have gotten through this without you.

719
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,760
Take her outside of the city.

720
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,600
Don't make any stops. You understand?

721
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,920
Looks like he's dead.

722
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,170
No.

723
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,140
His nervous system is shut down.

724
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,890
Well can you wake him up?

725
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,500
No.

726
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,730
Almeida.

727
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,290
Tony it's Jack. I'm on my way.

728
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,910
Yeah Jack

729
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,530
Henderson's in a coma. He's not coming out of it.

730
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,680
You've had your chance. He's mine now.

731
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,130
Damn it Tony just wait until I get there.

732
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,200
No I'm done waiting.

733
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,920
You don't want to do this. It's not going to bring back Michelle.

734
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,260
No

735
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,990
No but I'll feel better.

736
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,540
Trust me it won't.

737
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,070
You're probably right. I'll let you know.

738
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,550
Tony. Tony?

739
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,890
What'd Jack say?

740
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,030
He's on his way here.

741
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,410
We'll figure out what to do when he gets here.

742
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,790
There's nothing to figure out.

743
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,950
This guy's cooked.

744
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,740
Tony. Tony.

745
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,180
I-I couldn't do it.

746
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,620
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

747
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,360
You stay with me. Stay with me.

748
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,400
I need help.

749
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,510
Somebody help.

750
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,960
No no...

751
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,020
No hang on.

752
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,550
Hang on.

753
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,000
She's gone Jack.
