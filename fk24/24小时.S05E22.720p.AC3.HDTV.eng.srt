1
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,730
This is Bauer.

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,240
Jack,air traffic control just received a vci distress signal from your aircraft

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,410
that effectively authorizes president Logan to shoot you down.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,340
Start taking us down.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,970
Do it now.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,840
Jack,the f-18 is within 15 Miles.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,790
My radar is locked onto the target.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,980
-Lower the landing gear!  -We're going too fast!

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,850
Touch it down!

10
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,200
-we're ready to move Bierko.  -Thank you. I'll be right out.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,610
Vladimir Bierko,you're being transferred

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,060
to a primary holding facility in our district headquarters.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,100
Jack,the attorney general is on his way to his office right now.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,730
He'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes.

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,140
Chloe,I want you to prepare the recording for playback.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,180
I want you to clean it up and apply a digital signature

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,230
so we can establish a chain of evidence.

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,910
You work alone.

19
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,460
We got the evidence.President Logan's going to pay for David Palmer's assassination.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,440
The spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder would be devastating.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,480
Yes,it would.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,010
If only there were a way that we could prevent such a trial from taking place.

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,860
Mr. President?

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,440
You don't know me.My name is Miles papazian, I work under Karen hayes.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,940
What is this about?

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,610
It's about a recording,sir,

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,160
if leaked,could significantly compromise national security.

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,750
Why are you telling me this?

29
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,640
I feel compelled to intervene,and I just I wanted to make sure that you would approve.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,990
I do,Mr. Papazian, I do approve.

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,810
Get out of here,Miles.

32
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,250
I'm just doing my job,Chloe.

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,840
Well,if your job is is to slow things down, then you're doing really good work.

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,880
I'll tell Karen you'll be ready.

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,100
The following takes place between 4Am and 5Am.

36
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,830
The attorney general will be on the line in five minutes.

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,600
Did you tell him that the recording

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,370
implicates president Logan in palmer's assassination?

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,220
No. I feel he needs to hear it directly from the source.

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,600
Fine.

41
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,660
We're minutes away,Chloe, what's your status?

42
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,450
Everything is set up.I've got a t-1 line hooked in to the attorney general,

43
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,910
the other two lines are secured on dedicated channels.

44
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,880
What other two lines?

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,770
We're patching in a representative from

46
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,670
the house judiciary committee and a congressional liaison.

47
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,590
We need their support to call for an emergency session of

48
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,510
congress to begin impeachment proceedings.

49
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,900
Impeachment proceedings? What about an arrest warrant?

50
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,450
We'll never get justice to indict a sitting president.

51
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,390
Removing him from office is a necessary step to begin full criminal prosecution.

52
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,360
All right,Chloe,let's check the sound levels. Play the recording.

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,620
-What's wrong?  -I don't know.

54
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,460
What do you mean you don't know? Where's the recording?

55
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,360
This is what's on the digital medium.

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,910
That's impossible.See if there's an overlay, check your connections.

57
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,960
There are no mistakes.

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,430
Damn it,Chloe,you were responsible for this recording.What the hell happened?

59
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,710
I just told you,I don't know.

60
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,490
But if there was something on this memory chip,it's been erased.

61
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,390
-Yes?  -Excuse me,ms. Hayes.

62
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,960
The attorney general's holding on the line.

63
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,970
-Ms. Hayes?  -I heard you.

64
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,120
Bill buchanan will take the call in a moment.

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,590
I'll tell him we're having technical difficulties, we need to postpone the conference.

66
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,120
Someone got to that recording.

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,100
Perhaps it was damaged in your attempts to retrieve it.

68
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,490
It wasn't.

69
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,180
Chloe,who had access to this room?

70
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,460
-No one.  -Someone did!

71
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,390
Who had access to this room think about it!

72
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,450
-Miles was in here.  -What?

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,300
You sent him in here to check up on me while I was setting up.

74
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,500
I never sent him in here!

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,240
Jack...

76
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,150
Security,stop Mr. Bauer.

77
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,200
Mr. Bauer!

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,010
Jack.

79
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,800
Jack,stop!

80
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,360
You son of a bitch.

81
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,590
Let go of me,Bauer.

82
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,500
Do you know how many people lost their lives so I could bring that evidence in?

83
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

84
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,380
We know it was you.

85
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,840
Let him go,Jack.

86
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,940
Jack,let him go!

87
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,630
Where are you going,Miles?

88
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,970
I've been transferred. I was told to report immediately.

89
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,350
The order should be coming through any minute.

90
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,380
Transferred to where?

91
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,640
The white house.

92
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,760
How could you do this,Miles?

93
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,940
This is not over.

94
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,230
-There will be an investigation.  -Do what you have to do,Karen...

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,920
...but I work for the president now.

96
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,960
Jack,I'm so sorry.

97
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,030
I don't know how he did it, he didn't even touch the recorder.

98
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,950
Karen,audrey raines heard the recording when I played it for secretary heller.

99
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,050
I know that she will sign an affidavit...

100
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,950
Jack,not now.Chloe,take the recorder down to processing.

101
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,220
Break down the memory chip and see if you can restore anything.

102
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,620
Fine.

103
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,930
Ms. Hayes? The president's calling for you.Line two.

104
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,960
-Mr. President.  -Karen,

105
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,080
what's this I hear about a conference call you've scheduled with the attorney general?

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,380
Is there some problem I should know about?

107
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,170
It's nothing,sir,a mistake. The conference call was canceled.

108
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,540
Good,I'm glad to hear that.

109
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,510
Listen,the real reason for my call is Jack Bauer.

110
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,850
What about Jack Bauer?

111
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,250
I'm embarrassed to say that after further review,

112
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,060
it appears that the evidence against him is,at best,inconclusive.

113
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,030
Now,we'll have our lawyers continue to work on it, of course,but for the time being,

114
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,840
I'm suspending the arrest order.

115
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,750
You're dropping the charges against Bauer?

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,350
That's correct.

117
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,150
Mr. President,you have had this office,other agencies,

118
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,470
and the military dedicate all manpower and resources into apprehending Jack Bauer.

119
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,200
Yes. Based on evidence i initially thought was credible.

120
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,010
And now I have new information that's convinced me that the original intel was faulty.

121
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,620
Am I to release Bauer,sir?

122
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,930
I'll leave that to your discretion.

123
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,600
Thank you,Karen.Good work.

124
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,570
We'll be in touch.

125
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,240
Yes,Mr. President.

126
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,470
He's letting me go because he knows he's won.

127
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,250
What does he gain by releasing you?

128
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,390
I'll be on my own. Alone,unprotected,a perfect target.

129
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,720
Word just came in Bierko's escaped.

130
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,350
-What?!  -How long ago?!

131
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,480
The convoy that was moving him to district was hit about ten minutes ago.

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,660
They took out all Davis,on line three.

133
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
Davis,Karen hayes. What happened?

134
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,760
Our lead car got taken out by an ied.

135
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,980
I counted six attackers.Bierko got away before I could call in backup.

136
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,840
Did you see the vehicle?

137
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,200
Negative.I blacked out when I took one in the shoulder.

138
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,680
There's a medevac team on the way.

139
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,040
Before I lost consciousness, I overheard Bierko talking to his men.

140
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,460
He said they're not finished.

141
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,520
-"Not finished"?  -Yes,ma'am,

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,610
I'm certain he said something about a nerve gas canister.

143
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,370
Did he say anything else?

144
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,540
I'm sorry,ms. Hayes, that's all I heard.

145
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,640
All right,Davis,stand by. The medical team will be there in a minute.

146
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,580
Copy that.

147
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,120
-Why would Bierko even mention the sentox?  -I don't know.

148
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,680
I assumed all the canisters were destroyed in the explosions at the distribution center.

149
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,020
How many canisters has forensics accounted for?

150
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,360
By the time the fires were put out, there was not enough left to do a full accounting.

151
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,710
Damn it.

152
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,040
Bill,raise an inter-agency alert.

153
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,230
I need lapd to do a sweep of the ambush area for witnesses.

154
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,090
I want search helicopters. I want Chloe to have full domain over surveillance satellites.

155
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,460
This is priority one we have got to find Vladimir Bierko.

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,390
We held one in reserve, just as you ordered...

157
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,450
but I still don't understand why.

158
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,780
We can't do much damage with one canister of nerve gas.

159
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,050
You're so wrong. Let's go.

160
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,760
E-excuse me? Agent...

161
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,180
It's agent Cole, ma'am.

162
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,420
Cole. I'm sorry,agent Cole.

163
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,470
My husband said that Aaron Pierce had been transferred to washington,

164
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,270
and this is agent Pierce's phone.

165
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,330
I was wondering if you'll be so good as to make sure that it's returned to him?

166
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,760
Of course.

167
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,740
Was there anything else,ma'am?

168
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,760
No.

169
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,810
There's nothing else.

170
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,060
Oh,my god.

171
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,890
I'm sorry about this,Aaron.

172
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,340
Listen to me,Aaron.

173
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,380
You think you know what's going on.

174
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,470
I'm here to tell you,you don't.

175
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,820
Then why don't you explain it to me,Mr. President?

176
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,630
I understand Jack Bauer led you to believe that there was a recording

177
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,150
something that tied me to David Palmer's murder.

178
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,420
That recording doesn't exist.

179
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,640
That's not what I've been told.

180
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,370
You're not hearing what I'm saying.

181
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,400
The recording doesn't exist.

182
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,160
It's over.

183
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,550
You have a choice here,Aaron.

184
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,080
You are a good man.

185
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,950
You're a fine agent.

186
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,130
I see no reason to throw away your career.

187
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,930
But I need to know that we can put this behind us.

188
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,790
If you'll give me your word that you'll let this drop,

189
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,410
I will make sure that you are reassigned to whatever post you want.

190
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,670
Except for the white house, of course.

191
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,870
So...

192
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,090
what's it gonna be,Aaron?

193
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,620
Are my terms acceptable?

194
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,390
There is nothing that you have said or done that is acceptable to me in the least.

195
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,020
You're a traitor to this country and a disgrace to your office.

196
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,550
And it's my duty to see that you're brought to justice for what you've done.

197
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,230
Is there anything else,Charles?

198
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,000
I know Pierce,Mr. President. Served with him for five years.

199
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,770
And his loyalty is to David Palmer.

200
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,970
Believe me when I tell you, he's going to be a problem.

201
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,030
Mr. President.I confess,I didn't expect to hear from you again.

202
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,190
The situation's changed. Everything's under control.

203
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,750
The recording's been destroyed; it's no longer a problem.

204
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,840
That's very good news,Mr. President. But what about the people who've already heard it?

205
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,240
Can't do anything without proof.

206
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,990
I don't think any further action needs to be taken.

207
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,060
Then can we assume you've got the rest of your house in order?

208
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,320
If by that you mean my wife,yes.

209
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,050
Yes,she's cooperating fully.

210
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,850
As for Aaron Pierce,that's another matter,but,um...

211
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,290
I'm taking care of that.

212
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,030
Of course.

213
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,780
What about Jack Bauer?

214
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,810
I've already given Karen hayes permission to release him,

215
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,240
and the arrangements that we discussed about

216
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,680
taking him out have already been set in motion.

217
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,510
It appears you have everything well in hand,Mr. President.

218
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,560
Yes,yes. I said I would handle it,and I have.

219
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,120
Situation's contained,there's nothing more to worry about.

220
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,210
I'll call you back.

221
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,670
Mike?

222
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,710
-Sir.  -What is it,mike?

223
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,780
I just got off the phone with Karen hayes.

224
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,910
Vladimir Bierko has escaped.

225
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,020
What? How?

226
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,530
The caravan transporting him to district was ambushed.

227
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,000
Damn it! I thought we rolled ctu into homeland

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,480
security just to avoid screwups like this.

229
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,740
There's more,sir.

230
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,780
They have reason to believe Bierko might be readying another terrorist attack.

231
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,240
What kind of attack?

232
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,700
Well,ctu's working on that now.

233
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,530
I want constant updates. You keep me apprised of the progress.

234
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes,sir.

235
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,950
Chloe,any luck?

236
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,280
Only the bad kind. None of these satellites were positioned toward the ambush site.

237
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,750
By the time i queued a redirect, Bierko and his men were long gone.

238
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,840
You try caltrans?

239
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,880
I'm back-streaming now. So far,I've come up dry.

240
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,050
Keep trying. We've got to get an id on the vehicle.

241
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,380
I know.

242
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,410
That was lapd command.They've combed the area, but they can't find any witnesses.

243
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,160
None?

244
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,830
4:00 A.M. In the middle of a curfew; there simply wasn't anyone there.

245
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,600
Then we have nothing.

246
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,160
-We've got henderson.  -What about him?

247
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,550
Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas to begin with.

248
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,360
No,we've already been down that road. He won't talk to us,and you know that.

249
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,580
That was about protecting Logan.If henderson's the patriot he says he is,

250
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,800
he's not gonna want those terrorists to succeed.

251
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,150
Trust me,you're wasting your time. He's not gonna help us.

252
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,530
He will if we offer him a deal.

253
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,890
-That's not gonna happen.  -Jack.

254
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,980
No.Not this time. Not this man.

255
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,130
We're running out of options here.This is about saving lives,not indulging a grudge.

256
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,150
You think this is about a grudge? He killed an ex-president of the United States.

257
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,240
He tried to kill the secretary of defense.

258
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,290
You want this man to walk with full immunity?

259
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,850
It's not about what anyone wants, it's about doing what has to be done.

260
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,890
Nobody knows that better than you.

261
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,820
Bierko is going to kill innocent people. Henderson might be our only chance to stop him.

262
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,340
Jack...

263
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,320
what would David Palmer want you to do if he were here?

264
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,120
The best way to honor his memory is to make the choice to save others.

265
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,790
Obviously,I can't stop you from doing this.

266
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,070
If you're gonna give him a deal, at least let me present it.

267
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,930
-All right.  -Thank you.

268
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,440
Since you're clearly no longer a fugitive, I assume they retrieved that recording.

269
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,200
Someone got to it and erased it. I'm not here to talk about the recording.

270
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,870
Bierko escaped about a half an hour ago. He's gonna carry out another attack.

271
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,950
I'm sure he will.You bruised the man's ego when you stopped his first attempt.

272
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,760
You know him.You know how he thinks. You studied him before you set up this deal.

273
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,570
What's he gonna do?

274
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,980
Why should I help you?

275
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,190
You call yourself a patriot.Prove it.

276
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,860
These terrorists are gonna attack the country that you love, because you betrayed them.

277
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,240
Why don't you help me put out the fire that you started?

278
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,690
They sent you in here to broker a deal,didn't they?

279
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,660
What's the offer,full immunity?

280
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,060
That just must be really eating you up inside.

281
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,880
What do you think?

282
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,260
You were responsible for the murder of people that I cared about.

283
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,300
I am sorry about David Palmer,I am.

284
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,230
But what I did was in the interest of the destiny of this country.

285
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,050
And I'm not talking about the version you read

286
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,880
on the op-ed pages pages of the new york times.

287
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,440
I'm talking about the politics of survival the way the world really works.

288
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,460
Do you want immunity or not?

289
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,360
Immunity is worthless.

290
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,400
Yeah.

291
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,250
Jack.

292
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,390
That recording was my only immunity.

293
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,790
They give me a piece of paper, I walk out of here,I'm a dead man.

294
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,190
It's two days,two hours,two months, who cares? They're gonna take me down.

295
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,950
Who's they?

296
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,030
Same people that made walt cummings look like a suicide.

297
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,910
Come on,Jack.You can't really believe that

298
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,170
Charles Logan masterminded all of this by himself.

299
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,430
Give me the names.

300
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,530
You can't touch them.

301
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,160
But they can touch you.

302
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,530
I'll help you catch Bierko. But not for an immunity deal.

303
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,750
I need something more, and you're the only person can make it happen.

304
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,740
What do you want?

305
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,910
To disappear,just like you did so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese.

306
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,220
Except,I'm not gonna make your mistake.

307
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,200
I'm gonna leave the country, I'm gonna take Miriam with me.

308
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,660
You don't need my help for that.

309
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,190
Actually,I do.All of my contacts are still loyal to the president.

310
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,320
I need somebody I can trust to cover our tracks.

311
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,560
I need somebody who can do a better job of it

312
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,800
than those incompetents who failed to cover yours.

313
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,990
What makes you think that I'm not gonna kill you the second this is over?

314
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,640
Because you're gonna give me your word.

315
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,880
And I know what your word is worth to you.So it's all I need.

316
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,260
Let's say that I agree to this.

317
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,510
Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate,

318
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,060
this deal is off.

319
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,810
Fine.

320
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,280
Now,Bierko is gonna hit hard,

321
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,950
so you'd better think fast.

322
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,390
Chloe,do a phone check on these 14 names.

323
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,080
I want you working out of the situation room.

324
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,700
What do we have?

325
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,820
Henderson gave us 14 names that he believes Bierko's gonna contact first.

326
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,280
Chloe's doing a phone check and pulling up relative data.

327
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,580
-Is tactical standing by?  -They're on priority alert.

328
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,850
I put curtis manning in command, if it's all right with you.

329
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,060
I trust your judgment,bill.

330
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,060
Security's getting ready to bring henderson in here for a debrief.

331
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,000
Excuse me for one second.

332
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,110
Audrey.

333
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,340
Jack,I just heard about the recording. Has it really been destroyed?

334
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,900
-President Logan managed to get to it.  -My god.

335
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,760
We have a more immediate problem.

336
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,300
Bierko. I heard that he escaped. That's why I came back out here.

337
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,990
I was hoping that I could help.

338
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,550
Why is Henderson coming out of Holding?

339
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,880
We're using him to help us find Bierko.

340
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,690
Audrey,Karen made a deal.

341
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,970
She gave him immunity.

342
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,970
What?! Jack, how can you let this happen?

343
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,420
You know what that man has done.

344
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,190
We didn't have a choice.

345
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,470
Bierko's our number one priority.

346
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,040
We know he's planning another attack.

347
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,670
Without Henderson's help, we won't find him.

348
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,710
Jack!

349
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,870
I think we've got something.

350
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,100
Audrey,I'm sorry.

351
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,230
I've got to go.

352
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,710
All right ,what we have?

353
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,850
Out of the 14 names on the list,

354
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,670
only one has an active cell phone- Joseph Malina.

355
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,190
Joseph Malina's an arms dealer.

356
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,830
Used to be a military contractor

357
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,220
until they accused him of selling secrets.

358
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,220
But they couldn't prove anything,

359
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,750
so he beat all the charges.

360
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,490
You know him?

361
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,260
Well enough. I did business with him before and after

362
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,270
-he was arrested. -What do you have on him?

363
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,270
Malina got a 12 second call on his home phone at 4:03 a. m.

364
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,280
from a pay phone in Van Nuys not far from the ambush site.

365
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,400
A minute later,the same pay phone got a call-back

366
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,120
from a GSM Sat phone.

367
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,380
In other words,he took down the number,

368
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,320
called from an untraceable line.

369
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,410
Sounds like our guy.

370
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,310
Tell Curtis to mobilize his tactical team.

371
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,720
Hang on,hang on.

372
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,570
What good is that going to accomplish?

373
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,620
You're going to bring Malina in here.

374
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,950
You think he's just going to roll over on Bierko?

375
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,710
He didn't cut a deal when he was busted before,

376
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,360
he's not gonna cut a deal now.

377
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,730
And even if you can crack him-

378
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,580
I don't think you can-

379
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,140
you're going to need hours, and you don't have hours.

380
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,820
What do you suggest?

381
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,830
I suggest you send me in to talk to Malina.

382
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,250
I'll find out what Bierko got from him.

383
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,470
-I don't think so. -Jack,don't be stupid.

384
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,840
You know you can't get anything out of this guy,

385
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,960
and his computer makes this place

386
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,860
look like an Internet cafe.

387
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,860
He's got the absolute, most sophisticated,

388
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,220
state-of-the-art security system,

389
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,010
including a Phoenix Shield.

390
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,130
We can get through it.

391
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,280
Not a Phoenix. It's a poison pill firewall.

392
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,490
Any attempt at circumventing it,

393
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,710
and the hard drive does a cold-start erase,

394
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,020
at which point,you can forget about retrieving any data.

395
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,020
Take him back to Holding.

396
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,780
I don't think we have a choice here.

397
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,950
Karen,please,don't do this.

398
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,230
Jack,I know how you feel,

399
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,870
but Henderson's right.

400
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,480
We can't afford to gamble on this play.

401
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,700
Damn it,Bill, you cannot trust this guy.

402
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,660
I agree.

403
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,330
That's why I'm sending you with him.

404
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,890
I want him under your guard on a tight leash.

405
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,270
If he tries anything, I swear to you,

406
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,710
I will kill him.

407
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,260
Then don't let it get to that point.

408
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,670
Get in.

409
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,860
Adams,listen to me.

410
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,740
You don't have to do this.

411
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,950
Logan isn't worth protecting.

412
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,110
You know that.

413
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,960
He's not going to get away

414
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,690
with any of this, and neither will you.

415
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,650
Shut up and get in the trunk.

416
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,090
Use your head.

417
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,530
Logan wants me dead because he thinks I know too much,

418
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,890
that I'm a liability.

419
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,300
How soon before you're just another liability?

420
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,070
What are you doing?

421
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,380
Ma'am please stay where you are.

422
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,590
Aaron?

423
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,470
You're going to shoot me?

424
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,660
I'm the First Lady.

425
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,600
You're going to shoot the First Lady?

426
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,090
Who are you calling?

427
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,910
Mrs. Logan, this is my last warning.

428
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,230
Martha.

429
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,270
Aaron!

430
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,150
Aaron,stay with me.

431
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,400
Aaron! Oh,God.

432
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,840
Oh,God,Aaron.

433
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,190
Jack,we're coming up on Malina's place.

434
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,750
Curtis,I want you to set up a perimeter.

435
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,010
I want a man at each possible escape route.

436
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,840
-You got it. -As for you, you got ten minutes.

437
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,470
You don't get the intelligence from Malina by then,

438
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,270
we come through the door, and we interrogate him.

439
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,310
I'm gonna tell you again,Jack, interrogating won't work.

440
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,650
-This guy won't break. -Then you better hope your way does.

441
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,470
Get me an audio pack. Undo your shirt.

442
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,760
Wait a minute. You can't wire me.

443
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,310
Why not? Well,think about it,Jack.

444
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,590
You heard Malina's file.

445
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,160
This guy didn't get where he got by being careless.

446
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,730
He's got a scanner,frequency detector,God knows what else.

447
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,840
The second I walk through that door with a wire,

448
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,650
the bells go off, this thing's over.

449
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,390
Look,you don't trust me,fine.

450
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,260
And just so we're straight, I don't trust you,either,

451
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,380
but neither one of us can afford to blow this operation.

452
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,080
We're all set. Men are in position.

453
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,940
No games,Christopher.

454
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,580
I don't need another reason to put a bullet in your brain.

455
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,820
You got ten minutes.

456
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,300
Have CTU in-monitor channel 8.

457
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,720
Hold up.

458
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,630
Go.

459
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,570
Who is it?

460
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,730
What do you want,Chris?

461
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,070
We have to talk.

462
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,050
What,at 4:30 in the morning?

463
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,380
About Vladimir Bierko.

464
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,980
You don't waste my time, I don't waste your time.

465
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,300
You're going to want to hear what I have to say.

466
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,450
Hey!

467
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,940
What's so important it couldn't wait?

468
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,640
What are you looking for?

469
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,620
Is there another way out of here?

470
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,310
What the hell are you talking about?

471
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,700
Jack,I don't like this.

472
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,580
What's Henderson doing?

473
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,080
I don't yet. Maintain your position.

474
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,950
I repeat, maintain your position.

475
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,090
Secure-cache the files.

476
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,940
Anything you can't do without.

477
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,610
Why?

478
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,350
Because there is an entire phalanx

479
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,050
of CTU agents outside,

480
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,500
including an ex-agent named Jack Bauer.

481
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,040
He's selling us out,Jack.

482
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,350
Now,Bauer is running me.

483
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,620
I cut a deal with him, but I know

484
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,180
this guy's gonna kill me first chance he gets.

485
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,510
Curtis,move your team in now.

486
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,500
All teams,move in now!

487
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,900
You bastard, you brought him here!

488
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,350
He was coming here anyway.

489
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,320
So secure the files, crash the system.

490
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,470
Stop wasting time,and do it!

491
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,130
Give me a weapon.

492
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,360
Freeze!

493
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,090
Christopher!

494
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,250
Let me see your hands! Now!

495
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,370
Slowly stand up.

496
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,930
Put the weapon on the counter.

497
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,450
Step back.

498
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,930
Curtis, how are your men?

499
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,650
My men are fine.

500
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,030
I've been hit, but I'm okay.

501
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,130
Call in medical; get him transferred back to CTU.

502
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,770
What's Malina's condition?

503
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,840
Gunshot to the hip.

504
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,620
He's losing blood.

505
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,390
Stabilize him, keep him alive.

506
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,250
I had him,Jack.

507
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,060
30 more seconds was all I needed.

508
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,230
You played me.

509
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,550
This is over; you're going back.

510
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,450
No,you blew it,Jack.

511
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,660
What are you talking about?

512
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,900
I got him to life the firewall, and he was about to dump

513
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,540
all of his files onto a flash drive

514
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,060
before you jumped the gun and busted in here.

515
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,650
Now you're going to waste a hell of a lot of time

516
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,100
trying to decrypt those files off a mainframe,

517
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,430
so you'd better pray there's something on there you can read.

518
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,210
Cuff him.

519
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,500
Bill,this is Jack.

520
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,620
Get Chloe to open up a channel.

521
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,220
I'm going to send you some files from Malina's computer.

522
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,460
I'm on it,Jack.

523
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,020
Chloe,I need you to access these files,

524
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,220
find out which ones were opened in the last ten minutes.

525
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,310
They'll tell us what Malina sold Bierko.

526
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,000
They're coming through now hang on.

527
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,260
Bill,Curtis was hit he's stable,

528
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,550
but I'm having him transported back to CTU.

529
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,440
All right,Jack, I'll tell Medical.

530
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,910
Send a chopper over to this location.

531
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,410
As soon as we know whatierko's target is,

532
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,760
we're going to need to move fast.

533
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,940
Okay,I got through the firewall.

534
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,410
It's still going to take me some time to decrypt the files.

535
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,220
Chloe,just do it as quickly as you can.

536
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,760
Bierko's going to release the Sentox gas soon.

537
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,400
We need to know where.

538
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,020
There,you should have everything.

539
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,230
Let's go

540
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,920
Aaron?

541
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,590
Charles lied to me.

542
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,180
He said you'd been transferred to Washington.

543
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,650
That agent,um...

544
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,490
Adams,

545
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,600
my husband ordered him to kill you,didn't he?

546
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,630
Yes,ma'am.

547
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,350
But I'm sorry to tell you...

548
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,310
the president was involved with much worse things than that.

549
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,820
I know.

550
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:42,090
I was going to let him get away with it... all of it.

551
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,160
I was going to keep quiet.

552
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,380
We have to do something.

553
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,740
I'll hide the body, get him in the trunk,

554
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,370
but I can't drive it out of here.

555
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,750
The president has to believe that I'm dead.

556
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,430
I need to lay low, keep out of sight.

557
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,850
I can do it.

558
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,800
-No. No. -Yes,Aaron,I can drive it.

559
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,240
No,you need to get back inside the residence.

560
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,160
Your husband can't suspect that anything has gone wrong.

561
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,450
You need to find Mike Novick.

562
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,320
Mike?

563
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,130
Tell him everything.

564
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,160
And tell him to meet me here.

565
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,360
Okay.

566
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,980
Aaron,promise me...

567
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,650
promise me that if something goes wrong

568
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,870
and you're in danger of getting caught,

569
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,790
you will find a way off these grounds,

570
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,150
and you will leave.

571
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,600
Promise me.

572
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,410
You have my word.

573
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,670
Secure him by the tailgate.

574
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,170
Buchanan.

575
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,930
Bill,it's Jack.

576
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,260
How is Chloe doing with the files?

577
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,780
Almost there,Jack.

578
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,370
Okay,I got it.

579
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,840
Wait,there's something more.

580
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,400
Classified defense contracts and plans.

581
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,560
It's a Russian submarine,Jack.

582
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,770
The Natalia-K524, Delta-IV class.

583
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,220
It's here for inspection by our navy.

584
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,650
Why is the U.S. Navy inspecting a Russian submarine?

585
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,450
It's part of the treaty that President Logan

586
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,950
and President Suvarov signed.

587
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,050
There's a provision that calls for the sharing of technology.

588
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,350
Where is it docked?

589
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,370
Docking Station 8.

590
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,820
It's a non-military shipyard at the Port of Los Angeles.

591
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,530
I'll deploy TAC teams to the port.

592
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,720
Good.

593
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,510
Chloe,hold on.

594
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,240
What's the armament package on a Russian Delta IV-class sub?

595
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,800
Best of my knowledge,12 Scorpion land attack missiles.

596
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,980
Are they nuclear?

597
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,500
No,but they're fast and accurate.

598
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,560
ey carry multiple warheads.

599
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,620
One could take out several city blocks.

600
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,990
Uncuff him.

601
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,960
Karen,it's Jack.

602
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,900
Are you still there?

603
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,980
Yes,Jack,I'm here.

604
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,350
Okay,I need you to put me in touch

605
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,930
with the ranking U.S. officer on the Natalia.

606
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,160
We need to get them to lock out their onboard weapons systems!

607
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,030
All right,I'll have Audrey call DOD

608
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,760
and open a priority line to the sub,

609
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,070
and she'll get back to you.

610
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,790
Okay,thank you.

611
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,170
You're coming with me.

612
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,350
I found Bierko's target for you.

613
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,340
The deal was Bierko's head on a plate.

614
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,260
What do you want me to do now kill him for you?!

615
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,650
The only reason you're going with me

616
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,030
is 'cause you know the weapons systems.

617
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,160
Get in

618
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,340
Let's go!

619
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,280
This is Bauer.

620
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,200
Jack,I've got the U.S. Navy's ranking officer

621
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,920
on board the Natalia I'm putting you through.

622
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,060
Okay,Audrey, stay on the line.

623
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,470
All right,Jack,hold on.

624
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,780
Lieutenant Southern, you're on with Jack Bauer.

625
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,150
Agent Bauer,what is this about?

626
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,670
Lieutenant, we believe the Natalia

627
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,560
has been targeted for a terrorist attack.

628
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,830
You need to secure your vessel

629
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,490
and lock down your weapons systems immediately.

630
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,200
Ski!

631
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,870
Call all hands, set Condition Delta,

632
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,810
seal the bridge and aft hatches.

633
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,120
-Aye,sir. -You need to put your men on alert.

634
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,340
There's a threat to your submarine.

635
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,260
Now,what is the nature of this threat?

636
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,040
We think the terrorists are after your missiles on the sub.

637
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,590
I'm going to check right now.

638
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,240
Sailor! I've got that.

639
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,320
Report aft.

640
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,480
Bauer.

641
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,140
I'm checking topside.

642
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,210
Lieutenant!

643
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,480
Damn it,Audrey,I've lost him.

644
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,640
Notify DOD.

645
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,930
All right,Jack,I'm on it.

646
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,300
Captain,we need to move

647
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,160
Captain,how far out are we?

648
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,010
Just over five minutes,sir.

649
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,810
That way

650
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,440
Read me the code we got from Malina.

651
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,090
"Alpha 255

652
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,660
Tango Romeo 99."

653
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,250
We have control of the weapons system.

654
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,690
Are the missiles loaded?

655
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,770
Vertical tubes are loaded and ready.

656
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,130
Loading horizontal tubes now.
