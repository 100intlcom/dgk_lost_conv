1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,300
What happened to David Palmer wasn't supposed to happen.

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,900
He put himself in harm's way,

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,500
and he got involved with something that he shouldn't have.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,400
You know who killed David?

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,900
He works for me.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,900
You lied to me.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,500
This entire day has been one giant lie!

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,400
What you've done makes me sick!

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,900
Martha, enough!

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,300
I need you to swear to me

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,100
that you will do as I ask for the country.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,900
I hate you.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,100
The situation with Martha is taken care of.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,300
There are too many loose ends lying around.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,200
We cannot afford to have her pull on one and unravel everything.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,500
She won't.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
I have the recording.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,400
Have you destroyed it?

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,500
No, sir, I have not.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,600
You and I have been in this from the beginning.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,300
Destroying that recording protects both of us.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,300
I've got O'brian.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,900
Where is she?

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,100
She's working  out of Bill Buchanan's house.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,000
Did Chloe tell you why she was helping Audrey raines and Bauer?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
'Cause she thinks Jack is innocent,

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,300
that President Logan framed Bauer.

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,200
This is Karen Hayes

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,700
Miles traced Chloe to your house.

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,100
You have less than seven minutes to get Chloe out of there.

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,300
Karen, why are you warning us?

32
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,600
Because I may have made a mistake earlier.

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,400
Chloe,

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
if they find you here, you'll be arrested.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
You have to go now.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,800
Not yet.

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,300
It's over, Christopher!

38
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,700
Turn around!

39
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,100
Give me the recording.

40
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,100
I don't have it.

41
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,200
Where is it?!

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,900
Henderson wasn't lying.

43
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,100
He doesn't have the recording on him.

44
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,500
There must've been some kind of a hand-off.

45
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Henderson stopped and rendezvoused with another car.

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,300
Can you track the other car?

47
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,100
We're tracking it now, Jack.

48
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,200
It headed back to van nuys

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
looks like the civilian side of the airfield

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,300
pulled onto the tarmac;

51
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,500
whoever it was got out and got directly onto the plane.

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,900
It is a chartered diplomatic flight.

53
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,400
Jack, we've tried everything we can.

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,600
There's no way to delay the plane.

55
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,600
The following takes place between 2Am and 3Am.

56
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,800
Okay, call me when you've got 'em.

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Bill, are you out?

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,100
The field team's almost there.

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,900
Chloe's packing the comm gear she needs to stay in touch with Jack.

60
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Where is Jack?

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,700
Van nuys airport.

62
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,200
He stowed away on a diplomatic flight that just took off.

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,300
What? Why?

64
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,400
He's trying to find a recording that implicates President Logan.

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
And someone on that flight has it?

66
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Yes, and we don't know who.

67
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
That's what Chloe's been trying to find out.

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,200
Hang on.?

69
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,900
Field team's a block away from Buchanan's.

70
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,300
I'll set up here for the remote debrief of O'brian.

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,500
No. Put it in the situation room.

72
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,100
I thought you wanted...

73
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,500
I want it in the situation room.

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,700
Go.

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Bill, the field team's gonna be there any second.

76
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
Get Chloe out of there now.

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
How close are they?

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,900
One block.

79
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,500
All right, I'm gonna have to run interference.

80
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,400
It's more important that she gets away.

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,500
Good. I'll bring you in.

82
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
You'll be treated as a suspect.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,900
We never talked.

84
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,800
Understood.

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,500
They're here.

86
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,300
Out the back.

87
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,600
Bill, wait.

88
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,700
Have Chloe call me on a dry channel.

89
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,100
Either one-five or two-seven.

90
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,600
Dry channel,one-five or two-seven.

91
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,700
Got it.

92
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,700
There's a gate in back.

93
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,800
Follow the path between the houses to the alley,

94
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,500
turn right and go to ventura boulevard.

95
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
What about the curfew?

96
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,600
There's a hotel on the boulevard,the miramont.

97
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,300
You should be able to make it there without being spotted.

98
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,100
What about you?

99
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,600
I'm gonna make sure you're not followed.

100
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,500
I'll be at CTU,probably in holding.

101
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,600
Why in holding?

102
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,300
Karen's gonna place me under arrest.

103
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,100
If you need anything,

104
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,100
contact her.

105
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,900
-Why is she... -Chloe, please, just go.

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Who is it?

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Homeland security.

108
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,800
Mr. Buchanan,we need you to open the door.

109
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,900
We're under order from Karen Hayes.

110
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,900
I'll be right there.

111
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,300
What, what's going on?

112
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,100
Please step aside, sir.

113
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,200
We need to search the house.

114
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,500
No, I'm not stepping aside.

115
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Do you have a warrant?

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,700
Where's Chloe O'brian?

117
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,500
I have no idea.

118
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,300
Sir,

119
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,500
don't make us use force

120
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,600
we know she's been here.

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,700
Where is she?

123
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,700
I don't know where Chloe O'brian is.

124
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,700
She's not here.

125
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,100
Sir?

126
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,900
This is a recent file from comm.

127
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Only O'brian could access it.

128
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,900
Talk to us, sir.

129
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,500
I'm not talking to you.

130
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I'll talk to Karen Hayes.

131
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Papazian,

132
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,900
Mr. Papazian,

133
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,500
we are on site it appears Chloe O'brian was here,

134
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,800
but she is gone.

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,100
Is Bill Buchanan there?

136
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,600
Yes, sir.

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
We lost O'brian.

138
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,300
Damn it!

139
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,900
Put him on the phone, please.

140
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,900
Hello?

141
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,200
Don't play games with me, Bill.

142
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,800
Just give me O'brian's location,

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,300
or I will make it very bad for you.

144
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,100
From what I understand,

145
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,700
Miles, she got out of CTU right under your nose.

146
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
You're the one who ought to be concerned, not me.

147
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,900
Bill, this is Karen Hayes.

148
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,000
Tell us what you know now.

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,900
Stop wasting our time.

150
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,900
I'm not saying any more.

151
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
This is ed.

152
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
Ed, bring Buchanan in.

153
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,000
Set up a grid search for Chloe.

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,900
She's probably got a car,

155
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,200
which means she's about 15 Miles out.

156
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,300
Copy that.

157
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
But the agents on site are trained for interrogation.

158
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,400
Why are you bringing him in?

159
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,900
Because I want to run this, Miles.

160
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,200
But now it's us who are wasting time here.

161
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Don't worry.

162
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,500
I will make him talk.

163
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,900
I'll be in my office.

164
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,700
I'm set up at the miramont hotel.

165
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Make sure no one looks for me here.

166
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll take care of that.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Tell me what else you need.

168
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Jack's on diplomatic flight 520.

169
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,500
Pull up the manifest.

170
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Got it. Flight 520 to frankfurt.

171
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Okay, put everything you've got from that flight under the shared volume

172
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,000
so I can get to it.

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Crew, passengers, cargo,everything.

174
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,700
Done.

175
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Okay, I see it.

176
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,700
Thanks.

177
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,100
Jack, are you okay?

178
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm fine.Did you get what I need?

179
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I've got the passenger list

180
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,500
it's gonna take some time to cross it against Henderson.

181
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,700
What about the air marshal?

182
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,000
That I'll have in a couple of minutes.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,500
Okay, good.

184
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,700
What's happening at CTU?

185
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,900
They're still under orders from the President to stop you,

186
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,400
but Karen Hayes is backing us.

187
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,000
Openly?

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,200
No, but she's letting me help you.

189
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
If there's proof against Logan,

190
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
she wants it found.

191
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,500
The proof is on this plane.

192
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,100
Check the flight manifest,

193
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
figure out which passenger has a connection to Henderson

194
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,000
and get back to me with the air marshal's seat number.

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,900
I will.

196
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I don't think so.

197
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,000
I was just asking.

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,600
You don't have to go all feminist on me.

199
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,100
Did you see that?

200
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,300
21st-century woman.

201
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,900
We better get used to it.

202
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,600
Jack, I found the air marshal

203
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,800
his name is george avila.

204
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,100
He's sitting in 7a.

205
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,300
Anyone sitting next to him?

206
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,800
No.

207
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,300
Okay, good.

208
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,000
Get back to me when you've got the connection to Henderson.

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,900
Got it.

210
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,900
Excuse me.

211
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,100
Excuse me.

212
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Is that seat taken?

213
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,900
No.

214
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,900
Thanks.

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,900
The stewardess said I could change seats

216
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,000
I was next to the galley,

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
it's kind of noisy.

218
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
I'm trying to get some rest.

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,300
Okay, the man you're looking for is in seat 12d.

220
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,100
His name is Hans Meyer.

221
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,200
He's with the german government.

222
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
He's been connected to omicron since the mid-1990s.

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
He's worked directly with Henderson.

224
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,000
That's it.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Okay, I've got it.

226
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
Mr. Meyer?

227
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,100
Yes?

228
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,400
My name is george avila.

229
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm the air marshal on this flight.

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What's wrong?

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,100
It's nothing serious.

232
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,800
We found something that we think is yours.

233
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,700
It should have been in the baggage compartment.

234
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,100
We'd just like you to come back to the galley

235
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,200
and identify it for us

236
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,100
so we can properly stow it.

237
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,400
Please, sir. We'd  really appreciate it.

238
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
If you have any carry-on bags,

239
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,500
you should bring them with you.

240
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,600
I don't.

241
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,200
Very well.

242
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
What makes you think it was mine?

243
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,600
Ticket stub.

244
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
They have taken away all my medication.

245
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,700
I need to get to it.

246
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,300
I'm sorry, ma'am.

247
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
They won't let me give that to you.

248
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
What do they think I'm going to do?

249
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,600
Kill myself?

250
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,600
Over that son of a bitch?!

251
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,500
I just called the President of the United States a son of a bitch.

252
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,600
No reaction?

253
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,500
He must have some kind of law on the books against that,

254
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,600
or am I immune,

255
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,600
just like he is?

256
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,100
Do you have a first name,agent Adams?

257
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,600
It's Justin, ma'am.

258
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
You don't have much of a personality, do you, Justin?

259
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,300
This is Novick.

260
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,100
It's Martha.

261
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,300
Are you still in the retreat?

262
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,500
Yes. I'm just down the hall from your room.

263
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,400
I need you to come here right away.

264
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,600
I'll be right there.

265
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,800
They've cut me off from my medication.

266
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,600
You haven't been cut off.

267
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
Dr. Hill said you had enough in your system right now.

268
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
You need to wait a few hours.

269
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,900
I don't want to wait a few hours, Mike.

270
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,600
I need something now.

271
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,600
What's going on, Mrs. Logan?

272
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,200
I don't need counseling, Mike.

273
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,900
I just want a damn pill.

274
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,000
Sit down. Sit down.

275
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,600
Thank you, agent Adams.

276
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,400
We've been through some tough times before, Martha.

277
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Just follow the doctor's orders for now.

278
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,200
This is more than just a tough time, Mike.

279
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,400
None of this is going to go away.

280
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,500
I just have to live with it.

281
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,000
What do you mean, "it's not going to go away"?

282
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,600
What are you talking about?

283
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
I... I shouldn't have said that.

284
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,000
Martha,

285
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,400
it's me.

286
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,400
Say what needs to be said.

287
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,800
What needs to be said I can't say to you.

288
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
Why not?

289
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,600
Listen, Mike,I just...

290
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,900
I just need to get some sleep.

291
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,400
I'm just...

292
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,900
my nerves are shot from today.

293
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,000
I just need something  to calm me down.

294
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
I just need to get to my medication.

295
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,100
The President doesn't want you to leave the room.

296
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,000
Then you can bring it here.

297
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,500
I just want to take a couple of pills.

298
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,300
I need to sleep.

299
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,600
You can watch me take them.

300
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,600
I'll see what I can do.

301
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,500
yes?

302
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,200
They found Bauer yet?

303
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,400
No, they haven't.

304
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,200
That's not good.

305
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,000
I know that's not good.

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,900
I'm putting pressure everywhere I can.

307
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,200
I don't think I have to tell you how disastrous it would be

308
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,900
if Bauer gets his hands on that recording.

309
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,300
That's exactly right.

310
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,700
You don't have to tell me.I know.

311
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,800
When I find him,

312
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,300
I will call you.

313
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,100
Is there anything else?

314
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,200
No.

315
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,600
Good.

316
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,400
Mr. President?

317
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,600
What is it, Mike?

318
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,100
There's something I think I should call to your attention.

319
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,200
Yes?

320
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Your wife is in a very agitated state.

321
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,200
I don't know how to proceed.

322
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
Proceed with what?

323
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,600
She wants me to bring her her medication against doctor's orders.

324
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
That's all I need right now is to deal with her!

325
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,500
No! No!

326
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,800
No more pills.

327
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,000
And she shouldn't be wasting your time with this anyway!

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
Mr. President.

329
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,700
Is there something going on that i should know about?

330
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Why?

331
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,400
What did she say?

332
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,500
She needs more medication to calm herself down.

333
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
Something's clearly bothering her,

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
but she didn't want to talk about it.

335
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,590
I don't see where any of this becomes your business, Mike.

336
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,190
I'll tell you where,Mr. President.

337
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,190
I'm your chief of staff.

338
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,090
If there's something going on that I don't know about that involves national security,

339
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,000
it is my business.

340
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,790
This isn't national security,Mike.

341
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,200
It's our marriage.

342
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,400
I think both of us realized today,

343
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,700
At this point,

344
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,200
our relationship is nothing more than a facade,

345
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,890
and one that we're going to have to keep up for as long as I'm President.

346
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,200
I think that she's reacting to that, Mike.

347
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,600
I see.

348
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,690
I'm sorry, sir.

349
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,600
Mike?

350
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Give her what she wants.

351
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,200
Lord knows, she's in a lot of pain.

352
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,600
Where are you hiding it?

353
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,500
Hiding what?

354
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,300
What-what do you want?

355
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,200
What the hell is this?

356
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,900
I know who you are.

357
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,000
I know your connection with omicron.

358
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,900
I know your history with Christopher Henderson.

359
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,800
He asked you to take something out of the country for him.

360
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Where is it?

361
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
Christopher Henderson?

362
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I have not seen him in months.

363
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,900
Don't you lie to me!

364
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,200
I'm not lying, I swear!

365
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,900
I know Henderson,

366
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,500
but I don't know what you're talking about.

367
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,600
Did you check your luggage?

368
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,500
Yes.

369
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Find it.

370
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,800
Move!

371
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,300
What are you doing?

372
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,500
Nothing.

373
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,100
Homework?

374
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,300
Homework, yeah.

375
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
I didn't know they had wifi in here.

376
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,100
Could you leave me alone?

377
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,700
I can't talk right now.

378
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
You're a little,,

379
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,900
freaked out because of the curfew thing.

380
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,500
Join the club.

381
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,900
Yeah, okay.

382
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,700
When you come up for air,

383
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,900
I'm buying.

384
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,500
Airport customs.

385
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,400
This is Chloe o' brian from CTU Los Angeles.

386
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,800
I need to talk to somebody in passenger clearing.

387
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,200
I'll need verification.

388
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,800
Agency id: Ctu 99A-12.

389
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,000
the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign,

390
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
as we are expecting some turbulence.

391
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,200
Please return to your seat

392
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,900
and make sure your seat belt is securely fastened.

393
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,500
the passenger in 12D must be in the forward lavatory.

394
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,300
You should get him out.

395
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,000
The captain said it's going to shake pretty hard.

396
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,800
There's nobody in those.

397
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,500
I just checked.

398
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,100
Then where is this guy?

399
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,600
I don't know.

400
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,300
Maybe he changed seats.

401
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,900
Call the captain,

402
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,200
and tell him the air marshal's down,

403
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,300
and a passenger's missing!

404
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,900
What's going on here?!

405
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,000
Please be seated, sir.

406
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Now, sir!

407
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,400
Captain Cotter, this is Dan.

408
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
The air marshal's been assaulted.

409
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,100
What?

410
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,200
Assaulted?

411
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,500
What's going on back there?

412
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I don't know, sir,

413
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,400
but he's been knocked out,

414
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,700
and a passenger's missing.

415
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,400
Okay, okay. Secure the cabin.

416
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,900
Keep the passengers under control.

417
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,200
What's going on?

418
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,300
There's a problem in the cabin.

419
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,500
Make sure our door is secure.

420
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,700
It is.

421
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,000
What kind of problem?

422
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,200
The air marshal's been knocked out.

423
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,100
Call L.A. Center,

424
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,700
get vectors for an emergency return.

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,690
Mr. Avila, what happened?

426
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
The man seated next to me

427
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
where is he?

428
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,000
I didn't see him.

429
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,200
We got to find him.

430
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Damn it.

431
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What?

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,400
He's got my gun.

433
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,090
Mike,come in.

434
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,860
So,do you have something for me?

435
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,310
This is just enough for a couple of days.

436
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,110
-Dr. Hill's going to come in... -Thank you,Mike.

437
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,960
I'm going to get ready for bed now. Is there something else?

438
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,230
Yes,there is.

439
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,720
Earlier you said something to the effect

440
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,560
that I didn't know everything that was going on.

441
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,980
I was confused.

442
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,600
I wanted my pills.

443
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,450
I don't think so.

444
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,460
Are you calling me a liar?

445
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,770
I just spoke with the President.

446
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,000
And I got the same feeling from him I get from you.

447
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,160
Which is?

448
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,550
That you're both covering something up.

449
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,260
You know,Mike,I'm the one around here who's supposed to be paranoid,not you.

450
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,220
I know you,Martha.

451
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,950
And I know the President.

452
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,190
He said this was all about marital difficulties.

453
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,440
I think there's something else.

454
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,620
What is it?

455
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,630
Don't shut me out.

456
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,280
Maybe I can help you.

457
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,230
There is something else,Mike,

458
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,640
but it's between me and charles.

459
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,070
If that changes,I promise I'll let you know.

460
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,560
I don't know what you think Henderson gave me. I saw no one.

461
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,020
I was picked up at the consulate and brought directly here.

462
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,330
There are witnesses, you can ask them.

463
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,910
-Is this your only piece of luggage? -Yes.

464
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,220
If you're lying to me, I'll find out.

465
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,770
I am not lying.Please,

466
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,570
if there is someone on this plane that has something you want,it is not me.

467
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,780
Yeah.

468
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,330
Jack,I don't think Hans Meyer is our guy.

469
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,130
-Why not? -The timeline doesn't match.

470
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,300
He's been in customs for the last three hours clearing himself onto the flight.

471
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,050
-The plane's turning. -What does that mean?

472
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,150
It means they know I'm on board. Chloe,keep looking.

473
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,450
Okay.

474
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,360
are you sure he's down there?

475
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,270
There's nowhere else he could be.

476
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,720
Tell the pilot he can do it.

477
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,590
But there's a passenger down there with him. He'll die.

478
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,280
There's over 50 passengers up here. Call him now.

479
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,340
Do it.

480
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,710
Captain,

481
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,010
the air marshal says the baggage area is secure,

482
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,550
and that you should begin.

483
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,450
air's coming in.

484
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,130
It's not coming in, it's going out.

485
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,820
-What do you mean? -They're depressurizing this area.

486
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,230
What's going to happen to us?

487
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,160
If we don't get into the main cabin, we're going to lose consciousness.

488
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,700
Jack,what's going on in the plane? Security net just issued a bulletin.

489
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,500
Chloe,I need you to patch me through to the pilot.

490
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,610
I don't know if I can do that.

491
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,800
Chloe,they're depressurizing this area. We're going to lose consciousness.

492
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,380
Okay,okay.

493
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,040
Yeah,Chloe.

494
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,820
Jack needs us to patch him in to the pilot of the flight.

495
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,580
Can you get through on a CTU sub-channel?

496
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,390
-I'll try. Hold on. -I'll stay on the line.

497
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,550
Air control operator 44.

498
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,150
Yes,I need you to patch me through to the pilot

499
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,750
of diplomatic flight five-two-zero out of van nuys.

500
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,670
Hey,what do you got? A little voice-over ip going on there?

501
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,430
Please leave me alone.

502
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,650
No,seriously,I can help.

503
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,380
I know a way for you to get some free bandwidth.

504
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,900
-Really? -Absolutely.

505
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,490
Sit down.

506
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,530
Cool.

507
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,420
Wow,nice piece.

508
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,080
Never seen one of these before. What is that?

509
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,030
it's a CTU series four.

510
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,690
Chloe,they've opened the line to the pilot. I'll patch him through.

511
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,750
Thanks.

512
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,840
Okay,Jack,I'm putting you on with the pilot.

513
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,420
Go ahead.

514
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,270
This is captain stan Cotter. Who am I speaking to?

515
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,720
Captain,my name is Jack Bauer.I'm with the counter terrorist

516
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,180
unit in Los Angeles.I'm the man in your baggage hold.

517
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,450
What do you think you're doing?

518
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,260
I'll explain everything in a moment

519
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,070
but you're going to have to restore air pressure to this area.

520
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,620
Sir,I remind you, I am a federal agent.

521
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,240
What kind of a federal agent knocks out an air marshal?I don't believe you.

522
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,330
Sir,I was patched through to you by a CTU sub-channel.

523
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,420
I couldn't have done that unless I had clearance.

524
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,850
All I know is,you have a gun and you have breached airplane security.

525
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,700
Captain,this is a matter of national security. Now open the damn hatch!

526
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,610
What do you think?

527
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,070
He couldn't have patched in through CTU if he was hostile.

528
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,160
There's no point in taking a chance. In a couple of minutes he'll pass out.

529
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,850
From there, the air marshal can handle it.

530
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,730
Captain,we are running out of air down here.

531
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,170
captain,I know you can hear me.

532
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,120
There is a man on board your plane that is a danger to you. That's why I am here.

533
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,380
Open the hatch!

534
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,460
-I can't do that. -Okay,you son of a bitch.

535
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,960
What the hell was that?

536
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,310
-The aileron conduit's been breached. -What?!

537
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,470
What the hell do you think you're doing? You're going to kill everybody on this plane.

538
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,970
That's up to you. Open the hatch.

539
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,860
I'm not letting you up here.

540
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,550
Then you'll be responsible for everything that happens.

541
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,050
All right,all right, all right.

542
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,820
Sue,I'm going to stabilize the pressure and I'm letting him up.I want you to unlock the hatch.

543
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,370
The cockpit's secure. He can't get in here.

544
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,270
Yes,captain.

545
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,790
What do you think you're doing?

546
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,710
The captain ordered me to open the hatch.

547
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,960
Both of you,turn around and grab the wall.Now!

548
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,190
You... in the baggage hold.

549
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,890
Do it. Now.

550
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,570
Close it.

551
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,210
Lock it.

552
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,640
-Out of the galley now. -Get back to your seats.

553
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,690
-What's going on? -Sit down!

554
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,300
He has a gun!

555
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,630
everybody just stay in your seats. Face forward.Put your hands on your head.

556
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,900
Do what I tell you and no one will get hurt. If you don't,people will start to die.

557
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,580
Get the captain on the phone now.

558
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,650
Sir,he's in the main cabin. He has a gun.

559
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,080
Get the first-class passengers, move them into the main cabin.

560
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,430
Everyone to the main cabin.

561
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,320
Captain,this is Jack Bauer.

562
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,890
I want to assure you I have no intention of hurting any of your passengers.

563
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,760
I need to find something that's on the plane. It's a matter of national security.

564
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,070
What do you want,Bauer?

565
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,840
I want you to remain in a holding pattern so I can search your passengers.

566
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,080
If you're really a federal agent, then you know I have to land this plane.

567
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,920
Sir,that won't give me enough time.

568
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,480
That's not my problem.

569
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,590
I have a gun.Your air marshal is down. Captain,it is your problem.

570
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,190
You need to remain in a holding pattern, do you understand me?

571
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,090
You do what you have to do,Mr. Bauer. My job is to land this airplane.

572
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,410
And that is what I am going to do.

573
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,190
Captain? Captain...

574
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,030
That's all we have on flight 520,sir.

575
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:41,000
Okay,look,I want updates on the situation on a minute by minute basis if necessary.

576
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,530
Yes.sir.

577
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,810
Yes.

578
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,080
I just got word from the faa about a hiJacking aboard

579
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,510
a diplomatic flight that left van nuys a half hour ago.

580
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,940
So what?

581
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,880
Jack Bauer is the hiJacker.

582
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,340
What is he doing on that flight?

583
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,610
Looking for the recording that implicates me in David Palmer's death.

584
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,430
Henderson handed it off to somebody before he was arrested

585
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,790
and Jack must know that it's on board.

586
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,660
Then you shouldn't be wasting your time talking to me.

587
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,790
Order the plane down, and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.

588
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,650
Wait,what are you saying? That he hiJacked the plane?

589
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,180
Not exactly.He has control of the cabin. The pilot is landing the plane.

590
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,750
What about that recording?

591
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,950
He's still looking for it,but there's no guarantee he'll find it before the plane lands.

592
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,690
And after that, it's all over.

593
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,350
The President will have his people arrest Jack at the airport and isolate him.

594
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,220
What are we supposed to do?

595
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,440
Just keep helping Jack.

596
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,610
Chloe,I need to see that evidence. Call me if you need anything from here.

597
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,050
Fine.

598
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,450
Give me a second.

599
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,440
What's Bauer doing on flight 520?

600
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,370
You have no idea what you're dealing with, you little ass-kisser.

601
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,410
You don't talk to my people like that,Bill.

602
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,590
Take him to holding.

603
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,280
It's no wonder CTU fell apart under that guy.

604
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,600
Miles,I know you're trying to help, but I'll take it from here,okay?

605
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,820
Western operations.

606
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,080
This is Miles papazian, homeland security,Los Angeles.

607
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,220
Pass code 21 double six.

608
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,920
-Put me through to Mike Novick. -One moment,please.

609
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,920
Yes,Miles. What is it?

610
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,960
I need your input,sir,because

611
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,410
I'm having a problem with Karen Hayes.

612
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,290
I'd like to preface what I'm about to tell you by saying

613
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,170
that I don't wish to be second-guessing...

614
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,020
I don't have time for prefaces.

615
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,430
Karen Hayes was called in to replace Bill Buchanan.

616
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,770
She was hand-chosen by the vice President to take that post.

617
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,230
I understand that,sir.

618
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,340
Are you saying you feel she's unfit to do the job?

619
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,550
Four hours ago,she relieved Bill Buchanan for ineffectual leadership.

620
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,490
He's been working covertly with Chloe O'brian

621
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,250
to aid Jack Bauer,a federal fugitive.

622
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,360
Which means Buchanan needs to be dealt with appropriately.

623
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,890
What has Karen done?

624
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,210
She sent in a tac team to pick them both up,

625
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,530
but by the time they got there,O'brian was gone.

626
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,700
But instead of having the team do the interrogation of Buchanan onsite,

627
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,830
Karen wasted 20 minutes by bringing him in to CTU.

628
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,450
Maybe she felt the interrogation would be more effective with CTU resources.

629
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,970
But,sir,she isn't even using rudimentary CTU resources.

630
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,070
She wants to do a soft Q and A by herself.

631
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,610
Any leads we may have had on O'brian have dried up.

632
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,420
Wait a second,Miles.

633
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,800
I'm not going to pass judgment on Karen Hayes at this point.

634
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,030
She's not interrogating a terrorist.

635
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,090
She's dealing with a high-ranking federal employee.

636
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:02,010
Sometimes finesse and diplomacy are better than coercion.

637
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,230
Your concern is duly noted,Miles.

638
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,020
If you'll excuse me, I need to see the President.

639
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,710
-Karen. -Shut up,Bill.

640
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,170
We're offline. Now we can talk.

641
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,170
Look,you can continue this charade of me being under arrest

642
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,030
if you want to,but Jack needs our help.

643
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,150
And he's getting it, but make no mistake,

644
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,410
I am still in charge of this facility,

645
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,670
and until I see that evidence,I must remain skeptical.

646
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,510
-Have you talked to Chloe? -Yes.

647
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,280
What's Jack's status?

648
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,900
He's searching the cabin for the evidence, but the pilot is going to land that plane.

649
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,080
-How much time does Jack have? -15 minutes.

650
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,140
To search over 50 passengers? That's impossible.

651
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,520
Ms. Hayes.

652
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,610
The President and Mike Novick want an update

653
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,700
on the hiJacking of the diplomatic flight.

654
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,890
Put them through.

655
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,390
Go ahead,sir.

656
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,160
Ms. Hayes,this is the President. Talk to me about 520.

657
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,080
We know that Bauer's involved,but we don't know why.

658
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,490
Isn't it obvious?Bauer is a fugitive and

659
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,200
he's looking for safe passage out of the country.

660
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,100
Well,that's certainly a possibility,sir.

661
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,950
Listen to me. This man is desperate. He will say or do anything.

662
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,660
He's not to be trusted.

663
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,950
We need to take him down now, dead or alive.

664
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,640
Yes,sir.

665
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,710
-Mr. President. -Look.

666
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,660
You call the pilot and you tell him that

667
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,610
I don't care if Bauer is making threats or not,

668
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,020
that plane has to land immediately.

669
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,390
And when it lands,I want my

670
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,760
secret service detail to take him into custody,is that clear?

671
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,460
Ms. Hayes?

672
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,600
Yes,Mr. President.

673
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,410
The President has had knowledge of everything that's happened today.

674
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,800
He wants that plane down before Jack finds the evidence.

675
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,310
We have to buy him more time.

676
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,550
I don't have the authority to keep that plane from landing.

677
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,400
Sir.

678
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
-It still doesn't make sense to me. -What?

679
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,770
Jack Bauer has been on the right side

680
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,140
of everything that's happened today,up until now.

681
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,790
Well,right now,he is hiJacking a plane. This man is not stupid.

682
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,510
He's appeared to do the right thing,but right now,

683
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,240
he's backed into a corner,and he's desperate.

684
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,480
-Do you really believe that,sir? -I absolutely do.

685
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,780
Bauer's lied to us all day.

686
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,290
He's played us all for fools.

687
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,670
-Flight operations. -This is Chloe O'brian again.

688
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,940
Yes,ms. O'brian.

689
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,510
The copilot,Don Faganson,didn't check in when he boarded flight 520.

690
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,460
Mr. Faganson didn't board.

691
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,920
-Why not? -He was replaced at the last minute.

692
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,220
-By whom? -Scott Evans,the new copilot.

693
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,110
Here are your things, go back to your seat.

694
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,350
-yeah. -Jack,it's the copilot,scott Evans.

695
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,380
-How do you know? -He used to fly for hatton air.

696
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,690
It's a private charter company that worked exclusively for omicron.

697
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,360
Evans was assigned to Henderson's group.

698
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,030
He flew him around for over a year.

699
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,980
Okay,I need you to patch me through to the captain

700
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,930
on a discreet channel so Evans can't hear me.

701
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,190
Okay.

702
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,520
Sit down! Now!

703
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,540
Everybody stay in your seats and no one  will get hurt!

704
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,860
-You okay? -I'm fine.

705
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,840
Incoming com on line 139.

706
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,230
Go ahead.

707
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,210
Captain,this is Jack Bauer. I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.

708
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,090
The person that I'm looking for,

709
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,980
the man with the evidence that I need,is sitting next to you.

710
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,770
He's your copilot, scott Evans.

711
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,060
That's ridiculous.

712
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,400
Sir,my sources have informed me that Evans was a last-second replacement.

713
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,160
Can you explain to me why you're not flying with your regular copilot,Don Faganson?

714
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,820
Captain,scott Evans has been connected to a known terrorist.

715
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,150
You need to open the door.

716
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,010
This conversation is over.

717
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,350
Damn it.

718
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,430
What did he want?

719
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,450
He's desperate. Wants us to land.

720
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,760
-This is messed up. -Yeah.

721
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,660
Bad luck for you,huh?

722
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,320
Why?

723
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,680
Well,wasn't don supposed to have your seat tonight?

724
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,460
Yeah.

725
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,300
What happened to him?

726
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,730
I don't know. I got the call,so I'm here.

727
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,350
Yeah.

728
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,880
Oh,god.

729
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,200
What's wrong?

730
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,590
could you,uh...could you take the stick for a second?

731
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,570
You okay?

732
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,820
Yeah. I just... got a cramp in my leg.

733
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,830
Yeah. Those are a bitch.

734
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,360
Yeah.

735
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,600
I'm the only one who can fly this plane.

736
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,370
Now,you don't strike me as a man who's willing to die for Christopher Henderson.

737
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,100
Give me the recording.

738
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,900
Do it.

739
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,700
Slowly. Get up.

740
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,070
Get back in your seat.

741
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,970
You're going to land this plane or I'm going to put a bullet in your head.

742
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,130
Yeah,Jack.

743
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,960
Advise CTU I have the recording.

744
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,800
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.

745
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,310
Got it.

746
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,110
-Yes. -Charles.

747
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:29,220
If I'm going to live with this, then you're going to have to help me.

748
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,060
Help you do what,Martha?

749
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,010
Understand.

750
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,530
I...

751
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,430
I know you're a good man,

752
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,580
and that deep down,

753
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,440
you do what's best for this country.

754
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,960
Of course I do.

755
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,810
Then why...

756
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,800
why didn't you come to me?

757
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,140
I'd have been there for you.

758
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,970
I could have talked you through it.

759
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,270
For god's sake,Martha,for the last three years,

760
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,580
you've been one click away from a nervous breakdown every single day,

761
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,180
and I'm gonna come to you for advice?

762
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,430
-I'm gonna have to take another call. -No. Charles,no,no.

763
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,210
We'll talk later.

764
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,470
Yes.

765
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,670
Bauer's got the evidence. He is in control of the plane.

766
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,000
How do you know that?

767
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,970
We just picked up a call from Chloe O'brian to Karen Hayes.

768
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,300
What do we do?

769
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,820
You are going to have to shoot down that plane,Mr. President.

770
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,770
-What? -It's the only option we've got.

771
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,150
Otherwise,you go to prison for treason and murder.
