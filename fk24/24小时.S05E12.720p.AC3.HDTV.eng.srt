1
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,620
- Your wife survived the attack. - Thank God.

2
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,650
I should never have given in.

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,830
I should have ordered back the motorcade.

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,650
The terrorist attack failed.

5
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,310
We have to assume they'll make good on their threat to use

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,880
the Sentox nerve gas on American soil.

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,690
Listen, I made a mistake.

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,100
- I didn't think that I had any choice. - Charles.

9
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,920
You didn't stand up to them.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,160
You saved my life.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,290
You're welcome.

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,920
Country's lucky to have men like you...

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,140
I'm lucky.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,650
Mrs. Logan?

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,220
Christopher Henderson was responsible for setting up

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,890
the deal that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,030
He left me for dead.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,220
Right now, Henderson is our primary link.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,210
You are going to tell me now how to find the rest of the nerve gas.

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,540
Do it, Jack. Get it done.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,630
Shoot me.

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,250
You son of a bitch!

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,840
I shot her above the kneecap.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,430
- She can still walk. - Son of a bitch!

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,460
You make me shoot again,

26
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,370
she'll spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,910
Tell him what he wants to know.

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,980
I can't.

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,530
I'm bringing Christopher Henderson into CTU.

30
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,700
I need an interrogation room prepped.

31
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,300
I don't care that you took my wallet.

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,810
I just need to get my keycard back.

33
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,990
It's of no value to you.

34
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,860
It just lets me in and out of this building.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,870
Okay, you told me we were just going to take

36
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,390
his cash and a credit card.

37
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,140
That's how I'm getting us all this money.

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,190
$20,000 line of credit

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,850
right here.

40
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,010
Who's going to pay you that kind of money?

41
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,180
- I have the keycard. - How long will it take for you

42
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,540
to reprogram it?

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,060
Five minutes, and then we will be able to use it

44
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,490
to access CTU.

45
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,070
Good.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,230
The following takes place between 6Pm and 7Pm

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,190
Yes.

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,310
I'm reprogramming

49
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,000
the CTU keycard right now.

50
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,250
Will it work?

51
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,480
I need to change the ID,

52
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,270
but preserve McGill's executive entry privileges.

53
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,260
It won't be a problem.

54
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,330
Good.

55
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,980
Our couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets.

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,300
They'll be in place soon.

57
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,150
When are you launching your attacks?

58
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,820
After you're done at CTU.

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,680
I'm a few minutes out.

60
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,200
Call me when you're there.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,980
Understood.

62
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,360
We were able to neutralize the attack on the hospital, sir.

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,450
Good.

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,520
Do we have any idea

65
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,480
what the terrorists' next target might be?

66
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,400
We're working with federal and state authorities

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,700
to harden security around the highest-value targets

68
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,870
in Los Angeles.

69
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,960
In other words, no. We're completely in the dark.

70
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,670
We're just sitting around, waiting for Bierko to hit us again.

71
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,860
We do have one promising lead, sir.

72
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,200
Jack Bauer was able to recapture the man who escaped,

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,680
Christopher Henderson.

74
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,800
Henderson was a Defense contractor

75
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,430
who brokered the sale of the nerve gas to Bierko.

76
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,630
Is this the same Christopher Henderson who worked at CTU?

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,200
Yes, sir. He was head of Field Ops,

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,630
until Jack brought him down on corruption charges.

79
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,220
And this Henderson knows how to find Bierko?

80
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,090
We believe so, but he's not cooperating.

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,370
Jack's bringing him in for further interrogation.

82
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,030
Keep me posted on any progress.

83
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,290
Yes, sir.

84
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,620
Mr. Buchanan,

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,970
Tony Almeida's been asking to see you down in the Clinic.

86
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,830
I don't have time right now. Tell him I'll get to him as soon as I can.

87
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,910
And, Ms. Raines ?

88
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,940
Kim Bauer is here.

89
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,540
She's just clearing Security.

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,250
Put her in the Field Ops Office, please.

91
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,470
What's Kim Bauer doing here?

93
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,610
Jack asked me to call her.

94
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,880
Does she know?

95
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,230
Not yet.

96
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,600
Who's with her?

97
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,940
I don't know, but I'll find out from Security.

98
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,160
Excuse me.

99
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,300
- This is Bauer. - Hey, it's me.

100
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,930
Is Burke prepped for the medical interrogation?

101
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,970
Yes.

102
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,660
Jack, Kim just arrived at CTU.

103
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,610
- What did you say to her? - Nothing yet.

104
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,890
Good. I want her to hear it from me.

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,760
Jack, it might be easier for her

106
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,150
if she knows that you're alive before she sees you.

107
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,180
When I first saw you...

108
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,950
- It's-it's just... - Yeah, I know.

109
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,070
I-I... I understand.

110
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,550
Look, when you talk to her,

111
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,450
just explain that the reason why

112
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,370
I couldn't tell her I was still alive was 'cause

113
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,840
I was trying to protect her.

114
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,990
Of course, I will.

115
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,930
Audrey, thank you.

116
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,110
Kim's at CTU right now.

117
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,940
You know, after you died,

118
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,910
Chase left her, and she hit bottom.

119
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,710
Did you know that?

120
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,430
It's only right now she's putting her life back together.

121
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,080
Or maybe you did know that,

122
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,050
but you just couldn't do anything about it ?

123
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,150
This doesn't concern you.

124
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,900
Oh, I think it concerns me, Jack.

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,830
Miriam and I were there for Kim when you weren't.

126
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,860
Whatever you think of me, Miriam and I love that girl.

127
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,160
Are you okay?

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,500
Both my parents died here.

129
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,750
I swore I'd never come back to this place.

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,170
Well, we can leave right now if you want.

131
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,760
Here, she's coming.

132
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,720
Kim.

133
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,560
- Hi. - Hi.

134
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,380
This is Barry Landes.

135
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,210
- Hi. - Audrey Raines.

136
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
So, what is it?

137
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,580
What did you have to tell me that was so important?

138
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,310
I think it would be better if we talked in private.

139
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,740
Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of Barry.

140
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,960
- Kim, I really think that that this... - No, no, it's... it's Okay.

141
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,740
It's about your father.

142
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,600
What about my father?

143
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,270
He's alive.

144
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,630
Kim, he wanted to tell you but couldn't, in order to protect you.

145
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,750
Someone inside the government wanted your father dead,

146
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,680
so he staged his own death and went underground.

147
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,650
He knew, that you wouldn't be safe

148
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,070
if he told you that he was alive.

149
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,810
I didn't know either until this morning.

150
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,120
I thought maybe if I told you now before you saw him,

151
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,940
it might be a little bit easier.

152
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,760
He's on his way in now to CTU.

153
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,930
Hello, Mike.

154
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,280
Mr. Vice President.

155
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,740
I thought you were in Salt Lake City today.

156
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,040
Hal canceled his engagements to be here, Mike.

157
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,170
I think you'll agree we need all hands on deck

158
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,780
to deal with this Sentox situation.

159
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,870
- Of course, Mr. President. - Okay.

160
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,350
So, what's on your mind, Hal?

161
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,220
Mr. President, when these terrorists attack,

162
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,760
you're going to need to maintain order.

163
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,570
And I submit to you,

164
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,710
the plan you're implementing with CTU

165
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,130
is inadequate.

166
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,710
Sir, it was drawn up after a careful study

167
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,840
for an attack of just this magnitude.

168
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,040
CTU is already coordinating with first responders.

169
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,350
Fine, and they should still do so.

170
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,090
But what I'm proposing is something far more sweeping.

171
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,900
And I believe it's warranted by the facts.

172
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,970
Andrew?

173
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,820
To begin with,

174
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,850
I'm revising all of CTU's casualty estimates,

175
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,410
based on the assumption that the terrorists will hit

176
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,800
all of these high-profile targets: hospitals,

177
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,810
malls, sporting arenas, transit hubs.

178
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,110
My low estimate is 400,000 casualties.

179
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,900
Now, that's a considerable upward revision.

180
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,310
I'd like to know how you reached it.

181
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,400
Well, you're free to talk to my working group.

182
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,800
You know, frankly, I believe that there are a lot of people

183
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,830
who don't take this threat seriously enough.

184
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,100
I assure you we're taking it very seriously.

185
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,070
We have no agenda but to do so.

186
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,030
Considering these revised numbers,

187
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,560
what's your recommendation?

188
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,210
Well, I believe you should be thinking

189
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,720
of a preemptive declaration of martial law

190
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,310
in the greater Los Angeles area.

191
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,470
Mr. President,

192
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,610
martial law is appropriate only

193
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,150
as a last-ditch measure,

194
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,710
not as a preemptive one.

195
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,810
Go on.

196
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,590
Every study we've done has shown it would incite more unrest,

197
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,710
not less.

198
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,130
And you couldn't do it without approval from Congress.

199
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,820
Which is why we won't call it martial law.

200
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,300
No one is going to play semantics here

201
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,980
when we're putting troops on the street

202
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,820
to try to keep people from killing each other.

203
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,860
You're talking about a panic that hasn't happened.

204
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,390
Right now, the public isn't even aware of a threat.

205
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,590
You declare martial law, you'll have to tell them.

206
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,690
How long would it take to deploy the troops?

207
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,120
I've already been in touch with the Pentagon.

208
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,380
National Guard and Army units are on standby, pending your decision.

209
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,530
Mr. President, I agree there's a case

210
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,130
to be made, but for God's sake, let's make it to Congress.

211
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,130
- We can declare an emergency session... - We don't have time, Mike.

212
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,730
Hal is right. This... This attack could take place any minute.

213
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,410
If CTU can't find this man Bierko, we're going to get hit.

214
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,890
It would be smart to have control of the streets.

215
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,340
This is a mistake, Jack.

216
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,530
You don't want to do this.

217
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,610
Get out.

218
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,180
I'll get immediate immunity if I talk.

219
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,180
You know it, and I know it. And I'm not even going to ask for it.

220
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,820
Damn it, Jack. Will you listen to me?

221
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,690
I'm not trying to protect myself. I'm trying to protect this country.

222
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,780
What do you mean?

223
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,450
You don't want to know what I know.

224
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,100
You get me to talk, I promise you

225
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,360
you'll just be opening Pandora's box.

226
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,470
Tell me, and let me judge that for myself.

227
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,820
That's what I thought.

228
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,660
I'll set him up in Holding.

229
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,550
Let me know when he's ready for interrogation.

230
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,120
- Yes, sir. - Jack.

231
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,340
Keycard, please.

232
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,600
Oh. All clear, sir.

233
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,410
Yeah.

234
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,140
Okay, I will, thanks.

235
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,270
That was Curtis; he's on his way back from the hospital.

236
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,630
Okay, good.

237
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,590
Audrey.

238
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,790
Did you speak to Kim?

239
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,470
- Yes. - What was her reaction?

240
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,800
She's a little confused.

241
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,850
You should also know that she's here with someone.

242
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,230
I think it might be her boyfriend.

243
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,130
His name is Barry Landes.

244
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,170
- Where is she? - She's in the Field Ops Office.

245
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,610
- Okay, thanks. - Yeah.

246
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,040
I don't know what to say.

247
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,440
I don't know what you expect me to say.

248
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,790
You don't have to say anything.

249
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,720
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive?

250
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,000
I couldn't.

251
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,300
If you knew I was alive, you would have been at risk.

252
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,450
I had no choice.

253
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,650
You could have chosen to trust her.

254
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,240
I'd like to speak with my daughter alone, please.

255
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,600
I don't think that's a good idea.

256
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,930
I don't care what you think.

257
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm sure you don't.

258
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,080
All that matters is you, and the judgments you make.

259
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,660
Even if it affects those that love you.

260
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,770
Kim.

261
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,670
Barry, please, let me speak to my dad.

262
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,240
- I'll be right outside. - Yeah.

263
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,660
Don't judge him.

264
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,940
He was there when no one else was.

265
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,070
The most painful thing that I've ever been through

266
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,430
was having to walk away from you.

267
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,040
Even more painful than losing your mother.

268
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,300
But it was the only way to make sure

269
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,980
that you would be safe.

270
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,020
I buried you.

271
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,460
I... I know.

272
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,780
You know, there's something wrong with people like you.

273
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,650
You can't hold on to anything.

274
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,150
Chase couldn't either.

275
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,460
He tried for a while, and then he was gone, just like you.

276
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,300
And now, you're back...

277
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,750
and I'm just supposed to...

278
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,400
I'm happy that you're alive.

279
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,610
I am.

280
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,230
But I can't give you what you want right now.

281
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,050
Okay.

282
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,440
I understand that.

283
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,440
I need you to know that I'm sorry, and I...

284
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,040
Please, just go.

285
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,290
Excuse me.

286
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,990
Burke needs you in holding.

287
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,390
I'll be there in a minute.

288
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,190
I've got to go.

289
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,180
Barry's got a conference. We have a plane to catch.

290
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,600
Please, Kimberly...

291
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,250
I want you to stay just a little longer.

292
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,700
There are some things that I still need to tell you.

293
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,830
Please?

294
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,750
I'll talk to Barry.

295
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,090
Fine.

296
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,770
I'll be right back.

297
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,890
You call for me, Tony?

298
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,680
Yeah.

299
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,330
What's going on?

300
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,700
That's what I wanted to ask you.

301
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,150
What do you mean?

302
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,260
What do you think I mean, Bill?

303
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,200
My wife was killed this morning, right in front of my eyes.

304
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,560
And nobody here has told me who did it, or why.

305
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,580
The investigation is ongoing, Tony.

306
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,190
Come on, Bill.

307
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,980
I used to work here.

308
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,620
I know that's what you say to people

309
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,800
when you don't want to tell them the truth.

310
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,600
The truth is you're not an agent anymore.

311
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,950
And what you're asking me is classified.

312
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,470
Tony, it doesn't matter what I tell you, there's nothing you can do.

313
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,780
I know there's nothing I can do!

314
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,530
Look at me, for God's sake!

315
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,610
I just want to know who did it.

316
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,980
I think for the sake of all the years I've given this place,

317
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,520
and all the sacrifices I've made, I think I deserve to know. Don't you?

318
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,720
All I can tell you is...

319
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,620
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan...

320
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,160
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas.

321
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,940
Who's behind it?

322
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,650
Who's responsible, Bill?

323
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,090
The highest we've been able to get up the chain of command

324
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,460
is someone you might know from when you worked here.

325
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,950
Christopher Henderson

326
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,360
What?

327
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,880
Why?

328
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,840
We're working on it, Tony.

329
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,550
Don't let him get away with this, Bill.

330
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,990
Don't you let him cut a deal.

331
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,670
I won't.

332
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,180
What do we know about the man who's with Kim?

333
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,160
He's registered with the state as a clinical psychologist.

334
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,540
- She was his patient? - I think so, yes.

335
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,620
He's ready.

336
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,440
Whatever he's not telling us is important.

337
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,310
He knows what's coming.

338
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,800
And he's willing to tolerate an inhuman amount of pain.

339
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,350
Open the door.

340
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,720
Damn it, Christopher.

341
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,760
I don't think you became a part of this because of self-interest.

342
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,390
I honestly believe that you think

343
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,050
what you're doing right now is the best thing for this country,

344
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,270
but it is not your choice to make.

345
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,180
That's good, Jack.

346
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,020
Disarm your subject's resolve by showing empathy,

347
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,180
and respect for his agenda.

348
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,840
This is not a joke.

349
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,450
Thousands of lives are at stake.

350
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,120
People that we promised to protect, to make feel safe.

351
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,300
There is enough time for you to tell me what I need to know

352
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,680
to stop this insanity.

353
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,800
Please.

354
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,600
I'm sorry, Jack. I really am.

355
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,060
But I can't tell you what you want to know.

356
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,290
Start it.

357
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
Mrs. Logan.

358
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,140
Mrs. Logan, if I could have a minute.

359
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,880
If this is about Aaron, it doesn't concern you.

360
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,060
No, Mrs. Logan, it doesn't.

361
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,780
And I'm not here to discuss it.

362
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,580
What is it?

363
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,150
The country's facing a crisis.

364
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,160
The President needs you.

365
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,880
He, he needs me.

366
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,920
If you think the decision to let the attack

367
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,820
on the motorcade proceed was easy for him, you're wrong.

368
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,240
I was with him when he got down on his knees and prayed.

369
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,470
He did?

370
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,830
He loves you.

371
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,850
He didn't want to lose you.

372
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,980
But with the lives of so many people in jeopardy,

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,730
he felt he had no choice.

374
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,570
We've known each other a long time, you and I.

375
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,660
Why don't you stop talking about what a positive influence I am,

376
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,670
and tell me precisely what it is

377
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,630
you're trying to get me to do.

378
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,820
Vice President Gardner is advising your husband

379
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,050
to declare martial law in Los Angeles

380
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,800
in preparation for the release of the nerve gas.

381
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,560
He wants to do it without congressional sanction

382
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,460
or a timetable to lift it.

383
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,150
He can't just rewrite the law.

384
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,920
- Hal's got an agenda. - Well, he's wrong.

385
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,840
This will make things far worse.

386
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,910
Mrs. Logan, all I know is,

387
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,650
the President is listening to Hal Gardner.

388
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,080
And it will only help the country

389
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,380
to have him listening to you as well.

390
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,680
No, hold off on deploying units 7 through 12

391
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,640
until we finalize our target scenario.

392
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,270
What is it?

393
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,740
I was running a channel clearance,

394
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,900
and I noticed that one of the environmental systems

395
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,880
put out a trouble flag.

396
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,140
It's probably a tech crew changing out a circuit board.

397
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,450
That's what I thought, but I logged on to the manifest.

398
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,520
There's nothing scheduled.

399
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,030
Carrie, I'm in the middle of coordinating with first responders.

400
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,700
We're on high alert. I don't have time for this.

401
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,810
You don't have to snap at me.

402
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,720
I just thought someone should check it out.

403
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,580
Then check it out.

404
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,470
Carrie.

405
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,870
Can you forgive me?

406
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,600
You acted like the President of the United States.

407
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,450
Yes, I did.

408
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,940
But you wanted me to be your husband first.

409
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,320
Can't pretend that I didn't.

410
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,910
I still love you as much as I always did.

411
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,100
Martha.

412
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,910
There'll be plenty of time for us later.

413
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,380
You have to get back to work.

414
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,610
The country needs you

415
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,750
more than I do.

416
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,250
Hello?

417
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,590
Anybody working on the system?

418
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,940
Chloe.

419
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,850
Hi, Kim.

420
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,470
You're still here.

421
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,900
Yeah.

422
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,060
Look, my father said that he had to do something.

423
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,730
You know how long he's gonna be?

424
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,880
No, sorry.

425
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,910
Chloe...

426
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,470
I'm kind of busy right now.

427
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,570
You knew my father was alive, didn't you?

428
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,890
For a year and a half you've known.

429
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,020
Yeah.

430
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,730
He trusted you.

431
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,620
Only because he had to; I helped stage his death.

432
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,480
You don't have to make excuses.

433
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm not making excuses.

434
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,990
Four people knew he was alive, two of them are dead:

435
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,840
President Palmer, and Michelle Dessler;

436
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,370
and Tony Almeida's in serious condition.

437
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,460
Michelle's dead?

438
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,510
The only reason I'm alive is because your dad found me in time.

439
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,430
I know this is really hard for you,

440
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,780
and it's none of my business,

441
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,130
but you should try to cut him some slack.

442
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,390
What's going on, Bill?

443
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,460
Lynn...

444
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,800
What is it?

445
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,100
We just got a call from LAPD.

446
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,740
They found your sister's body in her apartment.

447
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,630
She'd been shot.

448
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,720
What?

449
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,210
I just talked to her.

450
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,180
I saw her today. That's impossible. She can't...

451
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,070
I'm sorry Lynn.

452
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,870
The police ID'd her body.

453
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,650
My God.

454
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,830
If you need a phone

455
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,180
to make some personal calls or talk to the police...

456
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,310
Her boyfriend did this to her.

457
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,470
Tell me he's in custody.

458
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,170
Is his name Dwayne Thompkins?

459
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,410
Yeah.

460
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,600
He didn't do it.

461
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,780
They found his body, too.

462
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,920
Lynn, the police are trying to make sense of something.

463
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,200
Do you know if either your sister or her boyfriend

464
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,660
were involved in dealing drugs,

465
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,060
or had ties to.... organized crime?

466
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,390
She was a... pretty serious user.

467
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,690
But organized crime... no way. Why?

468
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,480
The killings were clearly the work of a professional.

469
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,680
Oh, my God.

470
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,340
I need to see preliminary forensics.

471
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,450
Who's investigating? I have to talk to them.

472
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,970
- I can arrange a meeting... - No, I have to talk to them now.

473
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,360
They have to search the apartment. See if my keycard's there.

474
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,010
What are you talking about? What keycard?

475
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,720
My CTU keycard! She has it, Bill!

476
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,300
What was she doing with your keycard?

477
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,200
It was stolen from me, all right?

478
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,430
Her boyfriend took it.

479
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,690
- Why didn't you report this? - I'm reporting it now!

480
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,410
We don't have time to argue about this.

481
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,430
Call and see if anybody used it to breach security.

482
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,610
It was taken about...

483
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,890
about four hours ago.

484
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
O'Brian.

485
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,320
Chloe, I'm in Holding with Lynn.

486
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,670
I need you to check the gate logs, now.

487
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,480
What am I looking for?

488
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,450
Check and see if anyone used Lynn's keycard

489
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,210
to enter CTU in the last four hours.

490
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,890
Isn't Lynn standing right next to you?

491
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,090
Chloe, do it!

492
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,720
Oh, my God.

493
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,370
It's showing that his card was used

494
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,600
less than an hour ago at the executive entrance.

495
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,500
- He was already here... - Lockdown CTU now!

496
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,680
This is Chloe O'Brian. Initiate a lockdown now.

497
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,240
Mr. Bauer, I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on.

498
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,690
He should be talking by now.

499
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,920
Damn it, Christopher. It's enough.

500
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,120
I don't want to do this. Just talk to me!

501
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,750
I can't...

502
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,920
His vitals are crashing.

503
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,140
I need to stabilize him in the Clinic before administering another dose.

504
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,650
This is Bauer.

505
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,950
We've been compromised.

506
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,590
Someone used a stolen keycard

507
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,960
to access CTU less than an hour ago.

508
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,100
- Did you get an ID? - Not yet.

509
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,090
They didn't use the card to exit. They're still here.

510
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,090
We're in lockdown, starting a search.

511
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,730
I'm on my way. Get him over to medical. Stabilize him.

512
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,610
Don't let anyone near him.

513
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,080
Did you get him?

514
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,200
Still working on it.

515
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,280
Exits are sealed.

516
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,580
Security cleared Third East, they're going room to room.

517
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,610
Give me a comm unit.

518
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,220
Audrey, is Kim still up in Field Ops?

519
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,330
With Landes, yes.

520
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,060
Get her down here. I want a guard on her.

521
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,200
- I'm on it. - I think I got him in Third West.

522
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,240
He's in processing.

523
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,690
Could exit south or north.

524
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,600
Jack, take north. We'll give you updates.

525
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,830
Mac's team will head south.

526
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,000
Copy that.

527
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,430
Pull up north and south angles.

528
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,860
There he is.

529
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,140
Edgar, run his face through recognition software.

530
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,620
Where's Carrie?

531
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,510
We need to check for grid intrusions.

532
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,240
She's checking on a warning signal in a B-socket.

533
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,200
Got it. Checking the grid.

534
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,690
You're gonna help me get out of here.

535
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,190
- He's in the north corridor. - Chloe, cover for me.

536
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,670
I want to see what's keeping Carrie.

537
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,910
- Go ahead. - All units,

538
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,490
he's moving west in the north corridor.

539
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,040
He's got one of our men.

540
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,040
Enter your passcode.

541
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,330
But it's a lockdown!

542
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,560
Just do it.

543
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,790
He's in the north stairwell, sub-level B.

544
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,880
Jack, do you read?

545
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,200
I'm on my way.

546
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,330
Bill,

547
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,700
he's in the stairwell.

548
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,240
I don't think so, Jack.

549
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,390
Davis said he checked sub-level B.

550
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,570
Bill...

551
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,440
It was all clear.

552
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,260
No, he's doubled back.

553
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,430
He's using the stairs to get the roof.

554
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,830
All right, Jack.

555
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,890
I'm sending you into the landings.

556
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,260
Let me know when you're ready to move.

557
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,470
Copy that.

558
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,580
Freeze!

559
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,380
Let me see your hands!

560
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,830
Slowly.

561
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,980
Drop the gun!

562
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,360
Now!

563
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,870
Bill, it's Jack. Hostile's down. He's dead.

564
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,200
It was the only shot I had.

565
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,570
Do you have an ID, Jack?

566
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,640
We've got a bigger problem than that.

567
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,010
He's got a device on him. Looks like a relay switch.

568
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,310
Hold on.

569
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,700
He's got a PDA.

570
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,540
- Oh, my God. - What is it, Jack?

571
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,860
It's a schematic of CTU's ventilation system.

572
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,380
I think he tried to deploy nerve gas throughout the building.

573
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,770
Order an evacuation.

574
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,140
Code six!

575
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,290
Everybody out!

576
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,630
Go! Go!

577
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,320
Jack, I have Kim with me.

578
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,040
Stay with her. I'm on my way.

579
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,660
Make sure Burke gets Henderson out of here as fast as he can.

580
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,090
All right, I'm on it. Don't move. I'll be right back.

581
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,810
- O'Brian. - Chloe, what's going on?

582
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,790
Edgar, get out of the building now!

583
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,240
Carrie?

584
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,160
We have to get out of the building now.

585
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,170
- What's going on? - Just hurry!

586
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,240
What's wrong with those people?

587
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,750
Oh, my God.

588
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,100
The nerve gas is making its way in. Go.

589
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,700
The ducts run from the outside in.

590
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,560
"Outside in"?! What does that mean?!

591
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,070
They start at the perimeter and reach the building core last.

592
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,390
Auto-lock the outer doors.

593
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,090
- Which rooms can we seal? - I'm working on it.

594
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,590
Burke, I need you to stand by.

595
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,040
We can't leave the building yet.

596
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,970
I'll let you know where you can move Henderson.

597
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,220
- Chloe, what rooms can we lock down? - Hold on!

598
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,890
We can lock down the Situation Room,

599
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,750
the upper offices and Clinic Isolation.

600
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,810
Go, people!

601
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,870
Kim, everybody, in the Situation Room! Move now.

602
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,170
I'll access Comm from my office!

603
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,360
Burke, you can move Henderson to the Clinic Isolation.

604
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,450
Seal it off for bio. I repeat: Seal it off for bio.

605
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,810
Get in the Situation Room now.

606
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,960
Move!

607
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,540
Chloe, seal it. Seal all the rooms.

608
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,380
Open the door! You have to let me in! Open the door!

609
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,380
Oh, my God. Let her in!

610
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,370
We can't break the seal.

611
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,730
You have to try and find another exit out of the building.

612
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,140
Hurry! Go!

613
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,130
Chloe, are the rest of the rooms sealed?

614
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,320
Yes, it's done.

615
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,200
Everybody, stay calm. There's nothing we can do for her now.

616
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,050
Oh, no.

617
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,660
Oh, my God.

618
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,970
Chloe.
