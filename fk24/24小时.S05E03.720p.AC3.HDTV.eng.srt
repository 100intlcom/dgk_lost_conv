1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,660
Now, why would David Palmer call my wife

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,860
about a national security threat?

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,160
Can't risk having Mrs. Logan

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,400
obsess about this phone call.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,230
David Palmer called her yesterday.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,700
Our communications office

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,100
will have a recording of their conversation.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,530
Get that for me.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,960
You don't need to be concerned that

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,860
there's any connection between David's death

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,800
and the phone call he made to you.

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,230
He said it was a matter of national security.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,100
Those were his exact words.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,530
Martha, it's David Palmer.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,330
I need to talk to you.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,230
It's hardly a matter of national security...

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,950
No, that's not what he said.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,900
That is not what he said!

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,050
Yes, it is.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,330
I have dealt with the Martha Logan situation.

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,760
I was able to alter the tape of the phone call

22
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,260
before the president heard it.

23
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,760
There's no longer any evidence on my end

24
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,020
that Palmer was trying to warn her about the attack.

25
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,600
Sir, it's Edgar. I think we can find Chloe.

26
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,400
She's accessing our system through a laptop.

27
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm running a locate now.

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,960
What'd you get for me on Chevensky?

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,230
He's a baggage supervisor at the airport.

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,800
Jack Bauer! Agent O'Brian!

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,360
We know you're down here!

32
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,020
Don't fire!

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,800
Do not fire!

34
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,160
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

35
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,900
Jack didn't kill anybody.

36
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,590
He's being framed to cover up the

37
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,530
real reason Palmer was assassinated.

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,300
Where is he?

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,660
I can't tell you.

40
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,300
Where can I find the baggage claim supervisor?

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,530
- Down that hall to the left. - Thank you.

42
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,660
Chevensky!

43
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,230
Why was President Palmer killed?

44
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400
You are going to tell me what I want to know.

46
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,330
It's just a question of how much you want it to hurt.

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,200
Mom, do you see those men?

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,800
I have to warn Jack.

49
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,020
Derek, where are you going?

50
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,130
Come back here!

51
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,930
No!

52
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,230
Quiet!

53
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,410
Quiet!

54
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,830
You will not be harmed as long as

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,330
your president complies with our wishes!

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,280
The following takes between 9Am and 10 Am

57
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,750
We have a critical incident in progress!

58
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,950
I want a facility lock down and a code five evac, right now!

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
- Clear the area! Ma'am... - Officer...

60
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,560
Officer, my son is in there.

61
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,460
I'm sorry, ma'am. We're evacuating the area.

62
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,600
Follow these people.Ma'am!

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,030
Grab her!

64
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,830
I have to get my son!

65
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,670
Derek!

66
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,950
Derek!

67
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,800
I have information for CTU!

68
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,830
Please.

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,600
My son.

70
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,460
Everyone, quiet!

71
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,900
Stay down.

72
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,720
If you cooperate, you have a chance of leaving this building alive.

73
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,200
If not, you will die.

74
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,730
Do you understand?

75
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,460
Take out all cell phones and pagers and drop them on the floor.

76
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,860
We're going to be okay...

77
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,300
Bring them in.

78
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,340
Everyone up.

79
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,130
Move it.

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,260
Chevensky?

81
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,750
Chevensky?

82
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,680
- Yeah. - Well?

83
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,730
Chevensky's not here.

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,330
We have to find him. Keep searching.

85
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,030
Let's search the other rooms.

86
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,240
Come on.

87
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,050
Let's go.

88
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,000
McClaren.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,270
Listen very carefully.

90
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,350
We have hostages.

91
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,960
If you wish to keep them alive,

92
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,160
you'll make no attempt to re-enter the terminal.

93
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,830
We are wearing explosive vests.

94
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,400
We are prepared to detonate ourselves along with our captives.

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,480
If you make any efforts to enter the terminal,

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,330
you will spend the rest of the day collecting body parts.

97
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,600
Hello?

98
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,030
Set up a security perimeter.

99
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,000
We'll operate from the northwest apron behind hangar 12

100
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,160
and get those fire trucks out of here!

101
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,530
Everybody out!

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,830
Claremont, grab that woman in the yellow next to Bailey.

103
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,600
Bring her up here. Quick!

104
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,450
All right.

105
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,850
Yeah. Thank you.

106
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,210
Bill, I just spoke to the director of Secret Service.

107
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,780
Now that Suvarov has arrived safely,

108
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,850
they're lowering their security level by one.

109
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,250
I think we should do the same.

110
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,080
I'll take our Tac Teams off standby.

111
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,180
Have we heard back from our unit that was sent out to the refinery?

112
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,150
Yeah. At least that part of Chloe's story checked out.

113
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,200
So it's possible that Jack was set up in Palmer's assassination.

114
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,850
We can't assume too much.

115
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,710
Jack still has a lot to answer for.

116
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,460
Buchanan.

117
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,700
Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack Bauer on the line.

118
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,050
- Put it through. - Yes, sir.

119
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,060
Bill, put it on speaker phone.

120
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,810
Please.

121
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,840
Jack, it's Bill.

122
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,310
Bill, I'm inside Ontario Airport.

123
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,110
Gunman have just attacked and taken over Terminal One.

124
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,380
They are carrying automatic weapons and they have hostages.

125
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,240
We haven't received any alerts.

126
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,070
Trust me. You will.

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,100
What are you doing at the airport, Jack?

128
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,700
I was following up a lead.

129
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,710
President Palmer knew of the planned attack.

130
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,110
I believe that's why he was assassinated.

131
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,000
We just received an interagency flash.

132
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,500
There's been an attack on Ontario Airport.

133
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,110
First reports are of several men carrying automatic weapons

134
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,310
and they've taken control of Terminal One.

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,700
Go to alert level four.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
Launch all available Tac Teams.

137
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,740
Curtis is in the air.

138
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,970
Redirect him to the airport.

139
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,500
Have him maintain operational control the moment he's on site.

140
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
Right.

141
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,640
Jack, we just received confirmation of the situation.

142
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,400
I want you out of there now, Jack.

143
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,600
Turn yourself in.

144
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,170
Let our people handle this.

145
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,870
Understand this, Bill.

146
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,800
I don't work for you.

147
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,970
I'm staying inside.

148
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,080
You want my intel, fine.

149
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,880
But I'm doing this my way.

150
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,270
How many hostiles are there?

151
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,940
Approximately 10 to 12.

152
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,470
Gunmen have locked down the terminal.

153
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm going to be sending you photos of the hostiles.

154
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,200
They should be clear enough that you can identify them.

155
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,300
Hold on.

156
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,270
Okay, they're transmitting.

157
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,300
All right, Jack.

158
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,540
We'll pull a schematic of the airport and forward it to your cell.

159
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,670
Bill, hold on. One more thing.

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,870
A woman is going to contact you.

161
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,770
Her name is Diane Huxley.

162
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,820
I sent her and her son to CTU for protection.

163
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,270
Who are they?

164
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,690
I don't have time to explain, but I'm responsible for them.

165
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,700
Just make sure they're safe, okay?

166
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,400
We'll take care of them, Jack.

167
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,470
Thank you.

168
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll be standing by.

169
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,340
We have to alert the president.

170
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,970
Right.

171
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,590
I'd like to personally extend my condolences

172
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,790
on the loss your country has suffered today.

173
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,550
Thank you, Mr. President.

174
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,640
I hope that what you and I accomplish here today

175
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,690
will serve as a fitting tribute to David Palmer's legacy.

176
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,790
I can't imagine anything more appropriate than

177
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,500
the two of us establishing a comprehensive

178
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,770
antiterrorism alliance between our nations.

179
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,720
If you would excuse me for a moment, Mr. President.

180
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,360
Of course.

181
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,390
What's up, Mike?

182
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,940
Terrorists are controlling the main terminal

183
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,320
of Ontario Airport in L.A.

184
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,420
Terrorists?!

185
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,340
Yes, sir.

186
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,750
There are eyewitness reports of two casualties

187
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,850
and they've taken hostages.

188
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,850
Who are they?

189
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,120
Unclear.

190
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,290
CTU Los Angeles is prepping a briefing.

191
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,950
Mr. President.

192
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,420
I suggest we move to the Situation Room.

193
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,650
Now?!

194
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,140
CTU thinks this may be related to the summit.

195
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,990
Related in what way?

196
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,290
I don't know, sir,

197
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,250
but we'll find out during the briefing.

198
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,450
Sir?

199
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,690
We should go.

200
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,590
Of course.

201
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,390
Mr. President, as you've probably been made aware,

202
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,050
a situation has developed that

203
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,950
requires my immediate attention.

204
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,850
I have just been informed.

205
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,820
This is terrible news, indeed.

206
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,490
Please let me know if there is anything I can do.

207
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,490
I will. Thank you, sir.

208
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,350
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.

209
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,790
Spencer?

210
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,890
Pulling the ground plan of the terminal off the NTSB server

211
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,310
and sending it to Jack Bauer now.

212
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,990
Good. Edgar.

213
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,350
Were you able to identify the terrorists

214
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,650
from the photos Jack sent?

215
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,960
Still no matches on the watch list.

216
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,720
I tried three different encoding arrays.

217
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,880
Did you try widening the parameters?

218
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,300
If it was any wider, we could use the phone book.

219
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,000
Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,950
Try using NP-safe adaptive search.

221
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,090
You okay?

222
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,390
Thanks for asking, Edgar.

223
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,990
Chloe...

224
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,640
you managed to rack up four protocol violations.

225
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,220
Well, it's a lot worse than that if you count agency doc codes.

226
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,010
It's more like 26 violations.

227
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,410
Do you want me to figure out whose face that is?

228
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,740
Or I could just go wait in holding.

229
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,320
See what you can do.

230
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,190
- Did it work? - We got something.

231
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,850
It's off an archive from the Bureau of Consular Affairs.

232
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,880
Anton Beresch,

233
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,850
a former army officer in one of the Russian breakaway republics.

234
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,650
Which means this definitely has something to do with the summit.

235
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,750
I'll data-mine the interagency servers,

236
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,220
see what I can come up with.

237
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,920
DOD is receiving a localized broadcast from the airport.

238
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,920
The networks are also picking it up.

239
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,790
Spenser, put it on screen.

240
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,090
...citizens of the United States,

241
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,360
today your president and the president of Russia

242
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,600
have come together to sign what

243
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,830
they have called an "historical accord",

244
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,920
an "antiterrorism alliance".

245
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,430
Your leaders claim it will bring peace

246
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,000
and security to their respective countries.

247
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,950
As you'll soon learn, it'll accomplish exactly the opposite.

248
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,030
We are acting on behold of the oppressed people of our region.

249
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,480
A people whose desire to be free is every bit as strong as your own.

250
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,650
We are prepared to use every means

251
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,590
at our disposal to achieve our goal.

252
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,990
I have hostages.

253
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,040
Unless President Logan and President Suvarov

254
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,850
make a joint statement repudiating this accord,

255
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,920
I will order their execution.

256
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,920
You have exactly 90 minutes.

257
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,250
We have to get this lunatic off the air.

258
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,350
Sir, we can contact the networks,

259
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,240
but they're under no legal obligation to comply.

260
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,110
We take these actions with the full knowledge

261
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,860
that we will be called butchers,

262
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,330
but we are only responding to the violence

263
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,950
that has been inflicted upon our own sons and daughters.

264
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,080
Until we as a people achieve our own

265
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,260
due-- national sovereignty--

266
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,110
terror will be met with terror.

267
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,710
That was a live feed from the

268
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,990
Ontario Airport in Southern California.

269
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,990
As we just heard,

270
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,100
the terrorists are demanding that President Logan

271
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,150
repudiate the antiterrorism accord.

272
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,020
This is insane.

273
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,090
How did these people get control of an entire airport?!

274
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,390
We've been preparing for this summit for 16 months!

275
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,650
Every news agency in the world is here!

276
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,900
I've staked my entire administration on this day,

277
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,550
and now these people are demanding that I go on

278
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,340
national television and publicly repudiate everything we've done?

279
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,970
Mr. President, perhaps you should take a few moments...

280
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,750
Mike! I want this handled!

281
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,150
Do you understand?

282
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't care how you do it,

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't care what it takes-- fix it!

284
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,540
All right.

285
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,990
Go ahead.

286
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,110
Curtis, this is Jack.

287
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,720
I'm staring straight down on the main concourse.

288
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,810
I've got six hostiles wearing explosive vests.

289
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,120
Four of them are staying near the hostages.

290
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,590
I expect their orders are to detonate

291
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,890
if we try and make a move,the other two are roaming.

292
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,610
I've got two security doors on the northeast side of the concourse

293
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,890
both are chained, but currently unguarded.

294
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,700
All right, get a recon unit over to the northeast wall.

295
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,920
All right, Jack, I'm gonna need you to quarterback this thing from inside.

296
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,430
Copy that.

297
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,100
Hey, I got a woman, Diane Huxley,

298
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,050
says she has info for CTU.

299
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,510
Diane Huxley. Who is she?

300
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,940
- Curtis, did you just say Diane Huxley? - Yes, I did.

301
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,470
- Is she there? - Yeah.

302
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,770
Let me speak to her.

303
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,070
I'll bring her over.

304
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,470
Hello?

305
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Diane, what's going on?

306
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,540
What's wrong?

307
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,940
Derek is inside the terminal.

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,400
What are you talking about? I left him with you.

309
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,590
He saw some men,he wanted to warn you.

310
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,470
I tried to go after him. There was an explosion.

311
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,090
Are you sure he made it all the way inside?

312
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,500
I don't know.

313
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,940
Hold on.

314
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,140
Damn it!

315
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,430
I see him.He's with the other hostages.

316
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,000
But he's not hurt.

317
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,740
Please don't let anything happen to him.

318
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,940
Jack, I can't lose my son.

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,700
Diane, listen to me.

320
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,680
I promise you on my life,

321
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,570
I am gonna get Derek back to you.

322
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,930
Do you understand me?

323
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,230
Okay.

324
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,340
Let me speak to Curtis.

325
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,160
Jack.

326
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,400
Hey, Curtis, I need to ask you a favor.

327
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,580
I want you to let Ms. Huxley

328
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,700
stay with you at the command post.

329
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,500
You got it.

330
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,030
I need you to let me know if

331
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,500
the hostiles adjust their profile in any way.

332
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,270
Copy that.

333
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,900
I'll get back to you.

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,100
Son of a bitch!

335
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,680
His name is Anton Beresch.

336
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,410
He's a member of the Dawn Brigade,a separatist movement

337
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,130
blamed for numerous terrorist bombings in Russia.

338
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,500
Precisely the kind of terrorist organization

339
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,000
today's accord was designed to combat.

340
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,200
Bill, I have no intention of calling off this signing,

341
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,100
much less making a public statement to that effect.

342
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,550
So that gives you less than 90 minutes to rescue the hostages.

343
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,800
We're already operating under that timetable

344
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,400
Sir.We have a unit on the ground,

345
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,700
and we're making an on-site assessment.

346
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,260
Spare the agency patter

347
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,960
just get it done.

348
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,770
Sir, you need to be aware,

349
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,390
we should be prepared to accept

350
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,950
additional civilian casualties.

351
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,510
More casualties?

352
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,230
It's a possibility we have to face, sir.

353
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,710
I'm not prepared to accept any such thing.

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,400
Bill, it's your job to make sure those people get out of there alive.

355
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,200
Mr. President, the terrorists are wearing explosive vests.

356
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,670
They've threatened to detonate themselves and the hostages

357
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,330
if any attempt is made to retake the terminal.

358
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,800
I'm aware of the situation.

359
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,410
Bill, have you tried initiating a dialogue with the terrorists?

360
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,690
Yes, what about talking to them? Have you tried that?

361
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,990
Beresch placed a call to an Airport Police sergeant

362
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,800
it was a blocked number,

363
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,000
but we're in the process of back-tracing it.

364
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,490
Look, whatever you do,

365
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,860
just make sure it's done by the deadline.

366
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,630
When I put my name on that accord,

367
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,170
I do not want to be signing the

368
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,550
death warrant of innocent American citizens.

369
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,500
Yes, Mr. President.

370
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,130
Do you have that number?

371
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes, sir. We just completed the back-trace

372
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
Try it.

373
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,630
We're all gonna die.

374
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,000
It's gonna be okay.

375
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,200
Yes?

376
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,600
This is Bill Buchanan,

377
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,000
a director of the Los Angeles Counter-Terrorist Unit.

378
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,330
I am listening.

379
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
The president has authorized me to speak on his behalf.

380
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully.

381
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I've told you how to resolve this peacefully.

382
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,330
Your president

383
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,870
must make a public statement.

384
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,600
I know he's considering that option.

385
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,370
Then we have nothing more to speak about.

386
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,170
There must be some other way we can address your demands.

387
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,470
I don't think you understand just how serious we are.

388
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,500
I know ,the president...

389
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,500
Data-mine the call.

390
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,500
Yes, sir.

391
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,570
Get up!

392
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,370
- Up! -What?

393
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,200
Bring him.

394
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,870
Curtis, they're moving one of the hostages.

395
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
On your knees!

396
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,540
Oh, my God.

397
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,970
Please...

398
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,950
I have a wife.

399
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
So do I.

400
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,700
No.

401
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,930
You!

402
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,030
No.

403
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,630
Curtis, they're moving another one of the hostages.

404
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,000
I can't see where. I'm changing position.

405
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,030
- Derek? - Ma'am, please, ma'am

406
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,500
That's my son.

407
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,510
- Ma'am, please. - They're gonna kill my son!

408
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
That's my son!

409
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,600
Derek

410
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,000
No, let me go!

411
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,230
In 15 minutes,

412
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,060
your president will get another

413
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,830
demonstration of our commitment.

414
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
15 minutes.

415
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,430
I'm in position.

416
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,660
How much longer till

417
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,200
- you're ready to move in? - At least a half hour.

418
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,630
We're still transferring personnel from the summit.

419
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,190
Negative. That's too long.

420
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,330
You need to advance your attack.

421
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,560
We can't. We're just not ready.

422
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,730
Curtis, they're gonna kill that kid.

423
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,230
Jack...

424
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,720
I heard that woman Diane's side of the conversation...

425
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,960
This has nothing to do with her.

426
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,090
These people are gonna continue to

427
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,560
kill hostages until the summit deadline.

428
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,120
We can't risk the lives of all

429
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,620
those hostages for this one kid.

430
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,700
You know that.

431
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
I not gonna jeopardize the mission.

432
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,530
- Just tell your men to hurry. - They will.

433
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,030
It's all connected.

434
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,960
Maybe that's enough, Mrs. Logan.

435
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,960
The doctor said you really shouldn't be watching this...

436
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,790
Evelyn...

437
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,990
David Palmer called me last night.

438
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,930
He said he had something to tell me.

439
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,930
It was "a matter of national security."

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,390
I think it has something to do with this.

441
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,630
The terrorists?

442
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,150
Yes. I tried to tell my husband and Walt Cummings

443
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,130
but they think I imagined the call.

444
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,810
So we checked the phone recordings.

445
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,260
The conversations don't match.

446
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,700
Someone altered the conversation, Evelyn.

447
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,360
Who would do something like that?

448
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,900
I don't know.

449
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,600
Now listen to me.

450
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,300
You have got to cover for me.

451
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,530
No one can know that I am gone.

452
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,430
Do you understand me?

453
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,100
Where are you going?

454
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,910
O'Brian.

455
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,030
- Chloe, is that you? - Jack?

456
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,930
What's going on? Why are you answering the phone?

457
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,260
Mr. Buchanan needed my help with the airport crisis.

458
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,500
- Are you alone? - Yeah.

459
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,110
Okay, I'm going to send a picture of one of

460
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,660
the hostiles over to your screen. Hold on.

461
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,130
Okay, I got it.

462
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,360
I want you to enlarge the upper right corner of his vest.

463
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,280
Looks like a secondary detonator

464
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,930
cell phone activated.

465
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,460
Yeah, so the leader can set off the charges individually

466
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,460
in case anybody gets cold feet.

467
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,400
I need the detonation frequency.

468
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,120
Okay, I'll have to I.D. the detonator.

469
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,060
It could take some time.

470
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,830
Just get started.

471
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,660
Did you clear this with Buchanan?

472
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,630
No.

473
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,630
Chloe,

474
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,650
can you see the live feed?

475
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,220
Oh, my God. It's Derek.

476
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,860
I need your help.

477
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,740
Okay. I'll get back to you.

478
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,730
Spenser...

479
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,960
I was really worried about you.

480
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,760
Not now.

481
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,100
I need you to reconfigure Jack's phone

482
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,200
to emit an alternate signal.

483
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,400
What for?

484
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,500
Could you just work up a procedure?

485
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,470
This is off protocol, isn't it?

486
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,260
Yes.

487
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,090
Spenser, you have more knowledge about

488
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,860
bandwidth processing than anyone here.

489
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,600
I need you.

490
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,700
Got it?

491
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,330
Yeah.

492
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,560
It's Agent Pierce.

493
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan to the Garden Room.

494
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,800
She's still not ready.

495
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,640
President Logan is expecting her

496
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,430
15 minutes before the ceremony.

497
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,300
Could I speak with her?

498
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,240
What's going on?

499
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,300
She's in one of her moods.

500
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,060
If you push her, it'll make it worse.

501
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,800
I'll wait out here.

502
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,800
Thanks.

503
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,260
It's Mr. Burk, isn't it?

504
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,770
Uh, Mrs. Logan...

505
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,430
You work in the communications office, don't you?

506
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,900
Yes, Ma'am.

507
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,600
I know that all phone conversations are recorded.

508
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,760
Where do they keep those recordings?

509
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,890
Uh, well, the calls are recorded onto a hard drive.

510
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,080
It's part of the central server.

511
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,560
Is there, by any chance, any hard copies?

512
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,860
Actually, the President insists

513
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,090
on written transcripts as backups.

514
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,900
He...he's kind of old-fashioned that way.

515
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,460
I know. Where do they store those transcripts?

516
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,560
Archive room down the hall.

517
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,430
Can you show me?

518
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,860
Access is restricted.

519
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm the First Lady.

520
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,100
I understand, Mrs. Logan,

521
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,700
uh, but there are security requirements.

522
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,730
You...you have to have an entry card.

523
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,650
Do you have one?

524
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,760
Well, yes, I do...

525
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,260
Can I borrow it?

526
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,300
It's extremely important.

527
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,060
Mrs. Logan, I'm sorry.

528
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,630
Um... there's nothing I can do.

529
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,000
Mr. Burk...

530
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,400
we can continue this little dance if you really want to

531
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,150
but you and I both know

532
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,760
I am going to get into that room

533
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,120
so you can save us both the trouble

534
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,500
and just give me your entry card.

535
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,630
Mrs. Logan, you wouldn't...

536
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,550
You know, in three seconds, Mr. Burk

537
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,740
I am going to scream louder than

538
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,920
any woman you've ever heard in your life.

539
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,330
One... two...

540
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,800
Here's the card. Here.

541
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,110
Thank you.

542
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,200
I'll return it very soon.

543
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,300
O'Brian.

544
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,620
Chloe, they're going to kill Derek

545
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,860
in less than three minutes

546
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,900
I need that frequency.

547
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,400
We're still trying to find the manufacturer of the detonator.

548
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,700
Hurry. We're running out of time.

549
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,920
I know, but if we don't get the frequency right

550
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,400
we could accidentally detonate all the vests.

551
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,030
Okay, there's no match on any of the Czech military components.

552
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,230
That leaves the German manufacturers.

553
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,860
Jack, we're trying to narrow it down.

554
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,730
Now, the first team will enterthrough the southeast door

555
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,600
and split into two flanks.

556
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,490
The primary kill shots will take out the hostiles wearing bomb vests.

557
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,690
Second team enters through the southeast door

558
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,660
forms a protective ring around the hostages.

559
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,760
We'll only have a few seconds to neutralize the hostiles,

560
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,730
so find your targets fast.

561
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,590
Go.

562
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,560
What's your time frame?

563
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,600
We're on target to launch the assault in 15 minutes.

564
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,360
Understood.

565
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,960
How old are you?

566
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,860
Fifteen.

567
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,860
Try to control your breathing.

568
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,390
Slow down.

569
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,050
See?

570
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,200
Better.

571
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,260
Please don't kill me.

572
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,830
That's up to your president.

573
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,860
Bill Buchanan.

574
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,660
Beresch is calling from the airport, sir.

575
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,460
This is Bill Buchanan.

576
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,650
The boy hasn't long to live.

577
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,260
We haven't heard from the president yet.

578
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,260
We need more time.

579
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,600
No.

580
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,860
The president must announce the summit is canceled,

581
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,900
or I kill the boy.

582
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,460
We're doing our best to get

583
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,350
an answer from the president.

584
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,560
I implore you to resolve this without further killing.

585
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,390
This boy's blood

586
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,620
will be on his hands.

587
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,750
Come on, Chloe.

588
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,650
Jack, we just got a match on the manufacturer.

589
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,560
We're trying to figure out the frequency.

590
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,200
There's no match on the 2004 series.

591
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,860
It's got to be one of these three.

592
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,960
Hold him!

593
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,360
Agent Manning!

594
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,260
I got it.

595
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,660
Here it is.

596
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,200
We've got the trigger frequency for the detonator.

597
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,560
Go to submenu three on your phone.

598
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,560
I'm at submenu.

599
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,610
Enter this code: 6-3-3-9.

600
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,300
- Now what?  - The phone needs to reboot.

601
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,500
When it does, it'll give you a ready message.

602
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,030
Then you press the star key,

603
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,000
and it should send the signal to set off the detonator.

604
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,160
Your president has abandoned you.

605
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,220
I'm not getting a ready message signal.

606
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,170
It takes time to re-flash the ROM.

607
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,900
Son of a bitch, come on!

608
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,700
I'm sorry.

609
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,700
I got it. I got it!

610
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,260
Curtis, what was that?

611
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,620
There was an explosion in the terminal.

612
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,600
We can't tell what it is from here.

613
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,790
Patch me through to Jack.

614
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,530
Stay in position! Keep the hostages together!

615
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
Check the exits, make sure the perimeter's secure!

616
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,670
It was Ibrim's vest.

617
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,590
It must have detonated by accident.

618
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,600
Jack, what's going on?

619
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,230
One of the terrorists' vests blew up.

620
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,830
But none of the hostages were hurt.

621
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,850
Were you responsible for that, Jack?

622
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,560
Jack, answer me.

623
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,330
Bill, they were going to kill another hostage.

624
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,370
I didn't have a choice.

625
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,350
I didn't compromise my position.

626
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,690
Now you tell me this.

627
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,760
Are Curtis and his team

628
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,930
on schedule?

629
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,100
Yes. The backup units are in position.

630
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,100
- Go time is ten minutes. - Okay.

631
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,100
Everyone.

632
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,830
Fall into formation "B"

633
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,600
and run circuit checks on your vests.

634
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,830
The terrorists are revising their formation.

635
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,020
I'll contact Curtis in the next few minutes with final positions.

636
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,100
Thanks, Jack.

637
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,600
Mr. Buchanan, President Logan's on the line for you.

638
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,000
Mr. President.

639
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,340
The news is saying there was some kind of explosion inside the terminal

640
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,790
Everything is under control, sir.

641
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,220
Our tactical units are in position.

642
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,400
Go time is ten minutes.

643
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,900
Then what caused the explosion?

644
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,620
Well, we're not entirely certain, sir.

645
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,110
We believe that our man inside may have been

646
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,390
trying to stall the execution of a hostage.

647
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,000
He triggered the bomb vest of a hostile.

648
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,560
Did you authorize this action?

649
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,830
No, sir, he acted independently.

650
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,600
You should know, Mr. President,

651
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,930
the man we're talking about is Jack Bauer.

652
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,960
Jack Bauer?

653
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,700
He was in the terminal when the terrorists attacked.

654
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,750
He's been helping us coordinate our operation from inside, sir.

655
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,520
I thought that Jack Bauer

656
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,290
assassinated David Palmer.

657
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,600
There's mitigating evidence to suggest that

658
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,800
Bauer may have been framed,

659
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,460
Mr. President.

660
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,000
What evidence? What are you talking about?

661
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,660
It's complicated, Mr. President.

662
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,500
Why am I only hearing about this now?

663
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,230
I didn't distract you with details that could wait

664
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,730
until after we'd resolved this hostage situation,

665
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,830
sir.

666
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,920
You tell me everything

667
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,630
and I will decide which details are relevant.

668
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,860
With respect, Mr. President,

669
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,160
we don't have time.

670
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,630
Then talk faster.

671
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,790
Mrs. Logan is due in the Garden Room right now.

672
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,700
Open the door, please.

673
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,060
Just a few more minutes!

674
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,900
Ma'am, it's my job to make sure she's there.

675
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,810
If you don't open the door,

676
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,060
I will open it myself.

677
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,330
Mrs. Logan.

678
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
How dare you barge in here.

679
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,200
Mrs. Logan.

680
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,950
This is a private residence...

681
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,260
Evelyn, if something happens to Mrs. Logan,

682
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,630
the blame will fall on you.

683
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,460
We both know that.

684
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,900
So I am urging you in the strongest possible

685
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,460
terms to tell me where she is.

686
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,430
We're moving to entry positions.

687
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,530
Davies, Matthews, are your teams in place?

688
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,230
All teams in place and ready to go, Agent Manning.

689
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,130
All right. Copy.

690
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,430
Go.

691
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,820
- Oh my God... - It's okay.

692
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,430
- Listen, listen. - Derek's alive.

693
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,400
He's okay.

694
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,600
Are you sure?

695
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,030
I can't go into details, but he's okay.

696
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,900
I have to go.

697
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,260
We're mounting our rescue operation.

698
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,460
Thank you.

699
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,630
Keep an eye on her. Let's go.

700
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,610
They're waiting for you in the Garden Room, Mrs. Logan.

701
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,930
I can get up myself.

702
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,060
All right.

703
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,300
But you still need to come with me.

704
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,930
Whatever you say, Aaron. Whatever you say.

705
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,900
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Logan...

706
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,900
It's all right.

707
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,900
I'm really sorry.

708
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,500
Evelyn, will you stop apologizing?

709
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
It's annoying.

710
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,160
Besides, I got what I came for.

711
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,900
Yes.

712
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,430
You have a problem at the terminal.

713
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,430
Explain.

714
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,990
Jack Bauer is inside providing

715
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,250
recon for CTU's rescue operation

716
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,700
which will launch shortly.

717
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,100
Are you sure?

718
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,910
This came straight from the Director of CTU.

719
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,980
And Bauer was responsible for detonating

720
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,900
the vest of one of Beresch's men.

721
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,900
Can you tell me Bauer's precise location?

722
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,330
No.

723
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,950
But I know he has a connection to one of the hostages

724
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,400
a 15-year-old boy named Derek Huxley.

725
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,130
I have to go.

726
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,570
Tell them that's being handled out of the press office.

727
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,180
Thank you.

728
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,830
Yes?

729
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,660
Mrs. Logan is back in her room, getting ready.

730
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,830
Why the delay?

731
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,200
She was in one of the archive rooms.

732
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,980
Archive rooms...

733
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,730
What was she doing there?

734
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,730
The First Lady is safe and accounted for.

735
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,460
You'll need to ask her about anything beyond that.

736
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,160
Thank you, Aaron.

737
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,250
C.T.

738
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,100
Go to the ticket counters.

739
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,400
Go to the west exit.

740
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Manning.

741
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,730
Curtis, this is Jack.

742
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,560
Beresch's redeployed six men.

743
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,600
Are you ready for final positions?

744
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,330
Go ahead.

745
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,010
Four men were deployed to the east side of

746
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,540
the terminal in front of the ticket counter,

747
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,900
the other two to the west side of the terminal

748
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,330
in front of the emergency exits.

749
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,560
- Do you copy? - Copy.

750
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,200
Okay, once you deploy,

751
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,600
I'll give you real-time updates on their positions.

752
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,500
All right, Jack. I'm starting the countdown.

753
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,960
All teams stand by to execute.

754
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,430
This is it.

755
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,230
He's in the terminal now.

756
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
Okay.

757
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,000
Hostages up!

758
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,310
Hold on one second.

759
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,800
Hold on.

760
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,950
Hold on, Beresch is changing something.

761
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,000
Jack? Jack!

762
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,960
Curtis, what happened?

763
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,000
I lost Jack.

764
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,000
What do you mean, you lost him?

765
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,060
The connection's broken.

766
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,130
Can you reconnect?

767
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,400
I'm trying.

768
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,560
Jack Bauer.

769
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,980
Derek is a very brave young man.

770
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,420
I will shoot him in the head

771
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,000
if you don't show yourself immediately.

772
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,560
- Curtis! - It's not going through, Bill.

773
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,130
Can you move in without him?

774
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,300
The last thing Jack said was

775
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,000
that Beresch was moving something.

776
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,930
He could be moving the hostages into the kill zone.

777
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,560
Abort.

778
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,260
All teams, abort the operation.

779
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,730
Repeat: This is an abort.

780
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,960
Bauer, if you want to save the boy,

781
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,460
present yourself now.

782
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,700
Mr. Bauer!

783
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,630
Derek has five seconds left to live.

784
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,030
Four

785
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
Three...

786
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,540
Beresch!

787
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,100
I'm lowering my weapon.

788
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,530
Secure him.
