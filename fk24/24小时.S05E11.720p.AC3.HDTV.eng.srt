1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,770
Jack, we've authenticated the thumb-drive data.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,240
Omicron definitely made the Sentox for the military.

3
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,430
- Who is this Henderson? - Someone I used to work for.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,030
- Where? - CTU.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,430
He's the man who recruited me. Things ended badly between us.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,500
What are accusing me now of, Jack, being in bed with terrorists?

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,080
I need complete access to Omicron's Sentox program.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,340
I've got to merge some files,

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,150
find out who was working on this project.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,080
We need I.T. They're next door.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,810
I listened to everything Bauer had to say about the thumb-drives.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,140
CTU does not have enough information to hurt us.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,190
What about Bauer?

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,230
Well, in about one minute, he'll be dead.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,100
Oh, my God...

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,490
How could I be so stupid?

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,430
Mr. McGill, we think there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade.

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,140
My people are not going to chase that white elephant.

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,690
They're busy trying to locate 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas.

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,590
Now let my people focus on their work,

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
or I will have you escorted out of here!

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,280
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.

23
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,850
- What are you suggesting? - Section 112.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,800
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles and Ms. O'Brian, put them in holding,

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,370
and then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,240
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you of your command

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,600
under the "incapacity clause" of section 112.

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,310
Mrs. Logan is riding with the Suvarovs.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,430
Get my wife on the phone.

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,030
The terrorists were very specific:

31
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,540
if I don't allow them to attack the motorcade,

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,090
they're going to release canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations.

33
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,130
You need to get out of the car!

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,570
We're under attack; we need backup now!

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,380
I thought we had an understanding.

36
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,990
It happened outside of my authority. I told no one.

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,040
If Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president,

38
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,550
then its new ally, the United States,

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,260
will pay with the lives of its citizens.

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,830
Mr. President, this is our final conversation. Good-bye.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,060
No... Wait!

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The following takes place between 5Pm and 6Pm

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,740
- How long has he been conscious? - Ten minutes.

44
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,360
Before you go in, you should be aware of something.

45
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,830
Tony's been asking for his wife.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,930
He doesn't remember?

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,270
He remembers the explosion, but that's all.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
We have to tell him Michelle is dead.

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,960
No, absolutely not. He's undergone severe trauma.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,060
This kind of stress will raise his blood pressure

51
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,050
and make the vascular damage worse.

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,050
Please, just hold off on telling him until his condition has stabilized.

53
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,140
Would you excuse us, please?

54
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,960
Tony. How are you feeling?

55
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,710
They told me they took Michelle to Cedars.

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,510
Yes, they couldn't treat her here.

57
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,070
Why? How badly was she hurt?

58
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,210
Is she going to be okay?

59
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,990
As far as I know, yes.

60
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,540
What the hell's going on here, Bill?

61
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,060
They killed President Palmer, and they tried to kill Michelle and me.

62
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,430
David Palmer was the primary target.

63
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,980
They killed him because he was going to expose someone

64
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,990
inside Logan's administration. They set Jack up to take the fall.

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,730
- Did they get Jack? - No. He's alive.

66
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,680
He's working with us here on a provisional basis.

67
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,570
Bill, I need to talk to Jack.

68
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,330
- You need to rest. - No, I don't need to rest.

69
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,750
I need to talk to Jack. Now.

70
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,990
- I'll tell him. - Thanks.

71
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,880
Could you do me a favor?

72
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,310
Could you get a message to Michelle? Tell her I'm okay.

73
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,190
I will.

74
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,060
Tony...

75
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,970
We need you to get better.

76
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,860
Copy, Blacktop One. We're standing by.

77
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,210
The Navy helicopter is on its way, ma'am.

78
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,400
It'll take us back to the retreat.

79
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,990
He... didn't warn the motorcade.

80
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,960
Ma'am?

81
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,360
Charles, he knew about the attack, and...

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
he just let it happen, Aaron.

83
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,450
That can't be true.

84
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,990
He didn't just let it happen. He...

85
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,250
He gave the terrorists the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

86
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,570
Ma'am, why would he do that?

87
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,180
How soon before you're ready?

88
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,800
I'll be leaving in a couple of minutes.

89
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,070
I just need to finish setting the arming mechanism.

90
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,910
Make sure you place the canister to maximize casualties.

91
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,460
It must look as if this is one of our primary targets.

92
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,790
It'll be taken care of.

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,530
Yes?

94
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,170
Do you have the key card yet?

95
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,830
I'll have it within the hour.

96
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,650
They're can be no miscues.

97
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,070
I'm using up one of my canisters to create this diversion.

98
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,500
Without the key card, it's all for nothing.

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
Call me when you have it.

100
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,090
I will.

101
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,700
-Hello. - I'm going to be there soon.

102
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,200
Make sure you bring the money.

103
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,770
You'll have it.

104
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,200
And you'll have your precious card.

105
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,930
Careful. It's all we got left.

106
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,980
Don't worry about it.

107
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,530
In a little while, be able to buy all you want.

108
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,070
Mrs. Logan and the Suvarovs have been treated.

109
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,990
The chopper is picking them up now.

110
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,510
What do I say to my wife, Mike?

111
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,370
She put you in an impossible situation...

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,600
It's my job to handle impossible situations,

113
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,250
and I failed, and not for the first time.

114
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,800
- Mr. President... - I should never have given in.

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,670
I should have ordered back the motorcade.

116
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,040
Sir, with all due respect, you don't have time for self-recrimination.

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,120
The terrorists' attack failed.

118
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,240
We have to assume they'll make good on their threat

119
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,420
to use the Sentox on American soil.

120
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,410
Has CTU made any progress,

121
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,240
or are they just waiting for the other shoe to drop?

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,670
They're looking for a lead,

123
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,480
working the scene where the motorcade was ambushed.

124
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,930
Bill, they're airlifting the bodies of the terrorists to CTU.

125
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,970
When will they be here?

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,770
Any minute. I'm meeting them in the morgue.

127
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,850
- Let me know what you find. - You got it.

128
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,040
- Jack's calling in. - Put him on speaker.

129
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,560
Jack, we're in an emergency briefing with department heads.

130
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,080
Bill wants to put you on speaker.

131
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,830
I thought Lynn took Bill off the active roster.

132
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,520
Bill's been reinstated, and Lynn's been relieved of duty.

133
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,290
- Okay, fine. Put me on. - All right. You're on.

134
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,710
Jack, it's Bill. What did you find at Omicron?

135
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,100
Christopher Henderson was responsible for setting up the deal

136
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,460
that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.

137
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,920
He just tried to kill me by blowing up a bunker

138
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,450
that the Sentox was developed in.

139
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,830
I managed to survive, but unfortunately the servers that control

140
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,040
the data were destroyed and Henderson managed to escape.

141
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,810
- Chloe, are you there? - Go ahead, Jack.

142
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,460
Can you hack into Henderson's office computer?

143
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,200
I already did it. Henderson's home workstation is clean.

144
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,900
He wiped his hard drive five minutes ago.

145
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,330
- There's still an active socket. - What's that mean?

146
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,630
It means he's exchanging data with an off-site link.

147
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,700
Can you locate it?

148
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,060
Yeah. The registry listing is 5714 Tarawood Drive, Toluca Lake.

149
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,300
Tarawood Drive? That's his home address.

150
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,640
I'll send a tac team.

151
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,210
- No, Bill. I need to go in alone. - Why?

152
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,080
Henderson's good; he'll be able to detect a tac team moving in.

153
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,780
How do you want to play this, Jack?

154
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,060
He left me for dead. I'm the last person he expects to see.

155
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,740
I should be able to walk up to his front door.

156
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,860
All right. But I want you in constant contact with CTU.

157
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,240
Right now, Henderson is our primary link to finding this nerve gas.

158
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,090
I know. I'll get back to you.

159
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,580
You've reached the private client line for Banco Buenos Aires.

160
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,710
Please leave a message at the tone or

161
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,830
press the star button for immediate assistance.

162
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,320
Client identification code, please.

163
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,260
Eight-four-seven-seven-C, as in "Charlie."

164
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
How can I help you, Mr. Henderson?

165
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,570
I'd like after-hours access to my personal safety deposit box, please.

166
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,490
Yes, sir.

167
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,530
Buchanan.

168
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,960
Bill, we found a schematic of some kind of ventilation system

169
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,180
on one of the terrorists. It's from the Suvarov attack.

170
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,600
Since that's the most efficient way to deliver the Sentox,

171
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,720
this could potentially be their next target.

172
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,610
Do we know what building the schematic is from?

173
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,080
Not yet. But I sent a copy off to Building and Safety.

174
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,930
They're running it against their archive.

175
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,530
Upload it to Chloe and Edgar. I want them working on this, too.

176
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Better make it fast.

177
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,600
There's a number handwritten in the margin-- 18:00 hours.

178
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,910
That means the attack could happen in the next hour.

179
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,440
Yeah.

180
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,230
That was Curtis.

181
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,050
He's going to upload a set of schematics to our server.

182
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,210
This is the likely target of their next attack.

183
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,830
There was a time-stamp on it.

184
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,920
The attack could occur sometime in the next hour.

185
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,450
- Where is it? - We don't know.

186
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,090
The only thing Curtis could tell at first glance

187
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,100
is that it's the ventilation system in some kind of industrial building.

188
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,770
How big?

189
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,360
Big enough to hold several thousand people. Let's find it.

190
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,870
- How you doing, Tony? - Fine.

191
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,730
Have you heard anything else on my wife's condition?

192
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,560
I haven't heard anything new. Sorry.

193
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,710
Tony.

194
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,550
You'll have to get back to Recovery.

195
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,060
Get away from me.

196
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,560
- Mr. Almeida, please... - I said get away from me!

197
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,620
Tony, come on.

198
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,860
Michelle...

199
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,240
- Thank God that you're all right. - Let go of me, or I'll...

200
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,830
- Martha, please... - Listen, don't touch me.

201
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,320
Martha, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

202
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,790
I didn't think that I had any choice.

203
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,360
Charles... It isn't just that you...

204
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,460
You didn't stand up to them.

205
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,120
You should have stood up to them.

206
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,050
Martha...

207
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,410
Yuri, Anya,

208
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,210
I can't tell you how glad I am that you're both all right.

209
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,320
Thank you. It was awful.

210
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,550
I'm deeply embarrassed that something like this could happen on U.S. soil,

211
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,960
but I promise you, whoever did this will be brought to justice.

212
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,020
- Excuse me, Mr. President. - Of course.

213
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,420
We both know who is responsible for this.

214
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,900
We believe it was the same group who attacked Ontario Airport this morning,

215
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,630
but we thought that they were all killed in the siege.

216
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,130
Obviously, you were wrong.

217
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,530
The situation is much more serious than you know.

218
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,230
These terrorists have possession of a military-grade nerve agent.

219
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,840
And they've threatened to use it against the civilian population of Los Angeles.

220
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,370
- How long have you known this? - We just found out about it.

221
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,030
But given this change of circumstances,

222
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,320
I'm asking you to honor the terms of our treaty.

223
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
Allow my intelligence and law enforcement agencies access

224
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:52,220
to whatever intelligence your security people have on these separatists.

225
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,720
- You will have our help. - Thank you, sir.

226
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,920
Mr. President, I hope you won't find this offensive,

227
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,220
but there's something that's been troubling me.

228
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,390
- What is it? - Mrs. Logan-- her behavior.

229
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,820
She has not been herself.

230
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,460
I'm sure that she is very upset by what just happened.

231
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,270
Yes, I imagine she would be, but I noticed this before the attack.

232
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,040
From the time she entered the car with Anya and me.

233
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,020
Yuri, the truth is, my wife has been under a doctor's

234
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,770
care for quite a while now.

235
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,050
She suffers from depression and anxiety.

236
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,210
It's been very difficult for both of us.

237
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,590
- I'm sorry to hear that. - Thank you.

238
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,660
Guard said you wanted to see me?

239
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,130
How long are you going to keep me here?

240
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,360
You're not going out there any time today, Lynn.

241
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,340
District Marshal's reviewing your case.

242
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,930
I need to ask you a favor, Bill. I know I don't deserve it.

243
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,700
I was unfair to you earlier.

244
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,630
What is it?

245
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,540
I need to make a phone call.

246
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,520
Lynn, if you think you can get out of this with a few phone calls,

247
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,600
you're mistaken. I won't let that happen.

248
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,240
It's not that, I swear it.

249
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,790
I'll give you the number, you can clear it yourself.

250
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,170
- What's this about? - My sister.

251
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,470
I need to talk to her about a personal matter.

252
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,840
It can't wait a few hours?

253
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,780
No, it can't. Bill, please, she's in a little bit of trouble

254
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,080
and I'm the only one who can help her.

255
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,650
I don't need to clear it.

256
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,130
Get Mr. McGill a phone. Give him some privacy.

257
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,610
Thank you.

258
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,350
Thank you.

259
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,950
- Hello. - Jenny, it's me.

260
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,150
Listen, I don't care that you took my wallet.

261
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,160
Keep everything that's in there.

262
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,080
I just need to get my key card back.

263
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,120
- What key card? - My CTU access card.

264
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,720
It's of no value to you. It just lets me in and out of this building.

265
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,030
Well, can't you just get them to give you a new one?

266
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,730
I mean, that's what I did when I lost the key to my laundry room.

267
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,830
Damn it, Jenny, this isn't a laundry room.

268
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,450
This is a secure government building.

269
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,540
Now, if you don't want me to call the police,

270
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,620
you'll get me back the key card today.

271
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,310
- You hear me? - Yeah, I do.

272
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,860
Listen, I got to go.

273
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,740
Where's that card from Lynn's wallet?

274
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,950
Why?

275
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,200
Cause I want to give him back his key card. We don't need it.

276
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,170
That's how I'm getting us all this money.

277
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,190
You told me we were just going to take his cash and a credit card.

278
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,630
Yeah, we're taking a credit card.

279
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,460
$20,000 line of credit, right here.

280
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,610
$20,000?

281
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,890
Who's going to pay you that kind of money?

282
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,090
Yes, Mr. President?

283
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,780
I'd like to speak with my wife.

284
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,830
I'm sorry, sir. She asked to be left alone.

285
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,620
Evelyn, I want to see my wife now. Move away from the door.

286
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,200
Sir, she ordered me not to let anyone in.

287
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,460
I'm not anyone, Evelyn.

288
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,970
I know, sir, but she specifically mentioned you.

289
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,120
I have to get to a meeting.

290
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,230
Would you please tell my wife that I would like to speak with her?

291
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,850
Of course, Mr. President.

292
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,460
Thank you.

293
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,250
I'd like you to find Aaron Pierce right now.

294
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,950
I want to know how he's doing.

295
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,290
Is there a message you want me to get to him?

296
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,720
If he's all right, tell him I'd like to see him.

297
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,470
Chloe, come here.

298
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,190
I think I got a match.

299
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,980
There's a discrepancy here.

300
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,560
That's because they're from two different layers.

301
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,110
The one Curtis had was structural,

302
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,850
but this is an electrical blueprint.

303
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,450
You're right. Mr. Buchanan.

304
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,870
Edgar matched the schematics we got from Curtis.

305
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,630
- Where is it? - Tyler Memorial. Westwood.

306
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,580
A hospital.

307
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,260
Tell Curtis to activate a tac team.

308
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,930
I'll call Tyler Memorial, tell them to evacuate.

309
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,490
Operations.

310
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,650
Put me through to Tyler Memorial Hospital.

311
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,500
This is Bauer. I'm on-site at the Henderson house.

312
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,490
Do you copy?

313
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,350
Jack, we found intel in the body of a dead terrorist.

314
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,040
There is going to be an attack.

315
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,160
- Where? - Tyler Memorial Hospital.

316
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
We think it's happening within the hour.

317
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,820
Okay, I copy. I'm moving in now.

318
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,110
- Miriam... - Who?

319
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,730
Christopher's wife. He's not here.

320
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,020
Tell Chloe I'll get back to her as soon as I have access to his computer.

321
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,200
All right, we're on it.

322
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,220
This is Curtis Manning with CTU.

323
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,620
I need to speak to the ranking security officer on site.

324
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,140
You're talking to him. Tom Wegman.

325
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,720
Mr. Wegman, I'm heading to you now with a tactical team.

326
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,580
The nerve gas will most likely be released into a ventilation unit.

327
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,480
You need to seal off the sub-basement.

328
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,160
I've called in a second security shift.

329
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,440
We'll get that area locked down.

330
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,650
Good. How long before the hospital's evacuated?

331
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,190
Uh, an hour, maybe two.

332
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,740
This attack could occur within the next 30 minutes.

333
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,770
This is a large facility, Agent Manning.

334
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,790
We have 600 patients, many of whom need assistance.

335
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,110
Mr. Wegman, if this nerve gas is released into the ventilation system,

336
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,540
everyone inside that building will die.

337
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,100
Do what you have to do,

338
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,290
but get those people out of that building.

339
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,410
Right.

340
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,660
Hello, Miriam.

341
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,260
Oh, my God. We thought you were dead.

342
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,190
Where is he?

343
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,550
What are you doing, Jack?

344
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,290
Miriam, where's Christopher?

345
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,360
He's still at work.

346
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,630
Did he call you?

347
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,070
You're scaring me.

348
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,960
In the last hour, has he called you?!

349
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:46,820
No. Now tell me what the hell is going on.

350
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,630
I need to see his computer.

351
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,740
- What are you doing? - Where is his computer?!

352
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,190
I'm not going to tell you anything until you tell me what is going on.

353
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,980
Christopher developed a chemical weapons system

354
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,700
called Sentox-VX nerve gas for Omicron.

355
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,740
He enabled terrorists to gain control of it,

356
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,400
now it's being used against civilian targets in Los Angeles.

357
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:15,130
So where is his computer?! Miriam, I am telling you the truth.

358
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,150
We have proof that he brokered the deal.

359
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,320
That's impossible.

360
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,870
Less than an hour ago he tried to kill me.

361
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,370
Move towards the living room.

362
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,320
Keep walking towards the den.

363
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,300
I want you to take a seat on the couch.

364
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,120
Look, why don't we just call him? I'm sure there's an explanation.

365
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,240
Miriam, take a seat.

366
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,910
You don't need the gun, Jack.

367
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,110
You're not going to shoot me.

368
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,530
Chloe, it's Jack.

369
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,080
I need access to Henderson's hard drive.

370
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,450
I need you to talk me through it.

371
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,330
Okay, Jack.

372
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,060
Yes?

373
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,830
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

374
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,420
Oh, yes, Aaron, come in.

375
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,510
I didn't really get a chance to say thank you before.

376
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,010
You saved my life.

377
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,550
I know that you'll say it was all just in the line of duty.

378
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,500
You're welcome.

379
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,740
The country's lucky to have men like you.

380
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm lucky.

381
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,920
I hope you'll allow me to say that.

382
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,900
Mrs. Logan.

383
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,790
Would you excuse us, Aaron?

384
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,960
What is it, Mike?

385
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,880
The President's been trying to reach you.

386
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,950
I know.

387
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,700
But I don't want to see him.

388
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,020
Would you like me to convey that to the President?

389
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,410
You can convey whatever you want, Mike.

390
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,800
Mike...

391
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,510
Mike, I want you to know nothing happened in there.

392
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,550
Whatever didn't happen, make sure it doesn't happen again.

393
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,400
- Manning? - Yeah.

394
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,970
Tom Wegman, hospital security.

395
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,700
Thanks for mobilizing your people so quickly.

396
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,230
Have you uplinked with CTU yet?

397
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,430
We're doing that now.

398
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,470
We've doubled security at all sub-basement ingress points.

399
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,630
Nobody's getting down there unless they go through us.

400
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,470
Good.

401
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,390
The bad news is we have 26 patients in ICU that can't be moved.

402
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,590
Seven of them are high-dependency newborns.

403
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,340
We can't even relocate them without the

404
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,170
specialized transport units which we don't have on site.

405
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,600
What about nearby hospitals?

406
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,290
All neonatal transport units are in service.

407
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,480
All right, thanks.

408
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,750
I want a visual sweep of all high-probability target points within the hospital.

409
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,170
Team A, start at the north end,

410
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,540
Team B take south. Move.

411
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,870
It's Viktor. I'm at the hospital.

412
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,490
And why are you calling me?

413
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,420
They must have found out about the attack.

414
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,000
The hospital's being evacuated.

415
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,580
All of the elevators and stairwells are guarded.

416
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,760
Calm down, Viktor. Bring up the schematics of the hospital.

417
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,400
There's another entrance to the sub-basement.

418
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,720
An electrical conduit.

419
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,670
There's a good chance it isn't guarded.

420
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,840
How do I find it?

421
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,160
In the Radiology wing down corridor six.

422
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,860
Call us when you're there. We'll talk you through it.

423
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,180
I'll call you in a few minutes.

424
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,210
Viktor, I need you to finish this task,

425
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,000
even if it means you don't get out.

426
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,930
I won't fail you.

427
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,230
DOD just concluded a briefing with Russian Intelligence.

428
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,360
We were given a name. Vladimir Bierko.

429
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,150
He made billions in the post-Soviet economy-- weapons and oil.

430
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,070
He bankrolled several underground radical publications promoting the separatist cause,

431
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,410
but it's believed that he was more than just a sympathizer.

432
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,970
The Russians think he's financing these attacks?

433
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,700
They think that he's directing the attacks himself.

434
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,810
Based on what?

435
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,160
A number of communiques that were intercepted by the Russian security force,

436
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,820
supported by the fact that Bierko vanished from Russia 3 months ago.

437
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,590
We posted Bierko's profile to the interagency servers.

438
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,750
Homeland Security has issued an emergency brief to local law enforcement.

439
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,490
Do you think there's any hope of finding him

440
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,290
before the attack on Tyler Hospital?

441
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,770
The most promising lead we have is a man named Christopher Henderson.

442
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,830
Unfortunately, he escaped.

443
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,650
Jack Bauer believes there may be files on Henderson's computer

444
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,130
that could lead us to Bierko.

445
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,330
He's trying to acquire those files now, sir.

446
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,120
Well, let's hope he succeeds, Bill.

447
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,700
The country's already suffered three devastating attacks today.

448
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,340
- We need to stop this madman. - Yes, Mr. President.

449
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,660
Chloe, it's Jack. Have you found anything yet?

450
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,180
The only thing on Henderson's hard drive is domestic stuff:

451
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,320
bill-paying programs, downloaded music.

452
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,780
Chloe, Henderson isn't trading music files with his office.

453
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,430
There's something else on the computer. Find it.

454
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,930
I'm doing the best I can.

455
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,090
Why don't you face it, Jack? Christopher is innocent.

456
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,450
He was innocent when you forced him out of CTU, and he's innocent now.

457
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,510
Maybe you didn't hear me earlier, Miriam, he tried to kill me.

458
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,590
If he did, then he was defending himself.

459
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,990
No, he blew up the server room at Omicron while I was still inside.

460
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,370
He was destroying evidence that would have implicated him in this conspiracy.

461
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,450
This is so familiar. You're accusing him of being a criminal.

462
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,310
Why do you hate him so much?

463
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,840
I want you to know something.

464
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,400
Chris never hated you, not even after what you did to him.

465
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,950
When he thought you were dead, he looked in on Kim.

466
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,980
He cared about your daughter, Jack, just like he cared about you.

467
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,480
We both did. You know that.

468
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,160
- I found something, Jack. - What is it?

469
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,250
It's a shadow drive. It was partitioned from the primary hard drive.

470
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,630
What's on the shadow drive?

471
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,410
A backup log that contains data points for every satellite phone call

472
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,090
Henderson has made in the last year.

473
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,420
Can you cross-reference those numbers

474
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,870
with the telephone numbers the terrorists used earlier this morning?

475
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,260
I got into the log, but the phone lists are password-protected.

476
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,910
Hold on.

477
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,580
Christopher had a secret file on his computer. There's a list of numbers.

478
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,850
And that implicates him?

479
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,010
We need access to that list.

480
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,330
- Do you know the password? - No, I don't.

481
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,550
Miriam, we believe there's going to be another attack within 30 minutes.

482
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,120
Thousands of lives are at stake.

483
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,890
Please, if you know that password, I need it now.

484
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,260
I can't help you.

485
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,690
Chloe, you're going to have to try and hack into it.

486
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,680
I'll see what I can do.

487
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,460
Hurry.

488
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,430
I'll show this to Manning.

489
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,840
Agent Manning?

490
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,500
One of our guards caught this.

491
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,380
This guy's dressed as an orderly, but I've never seen him before.

492
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,160
An orderly has no business being where he is.

493
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,490
That was five minutes ago.

494
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,590
- Where is this? - Sub-basement.

495
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,290
Team A, meet me in the southeast stairwell.

496
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,780
Team B, form a soft perimeter.

497
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,130
We have a possible suspect in play.

498
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,060
- CTU, did you copy that? - Yes, we copy.

499
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,510
Edgar, I need you to uplink the hospital video surveillance

500
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,150
for facial recognition software. See if you can get a match.

501
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,390
Got it.

502
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,660
Curtis has a suspect.

503
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,880
We're running the image through facial recognition.

504
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,640
Halfway through the database.

505
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,650
- Got something. - All right, put it up.

506
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,950
Curtis, we have a suspect.

507
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,290
His name is Viktor Grigorin. He's a Russian national.

508
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,360
Served time for drug smuggling and weapons trafficking.

509
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,840
Copy that.

510
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,590
All teams, suspect is a confirmed hostile.

511
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,290
Repeat: a confirmed hostile.

512
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:22,930
Freeze!

513
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,650
Don't move!

514
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,680
Agent Manning, you need to come look at this.

515
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,540
Search him.

516
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,670
Don't! It might be set to go off if it's moved.

517
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,600
Chemical Response Team, we need you down here now.

518
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,130
All teams, we've located the canister, and it is armed.

519
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,000
Repeat: the canister is armed.

520
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,280
CTU, Chemical Response Team is on the way in.

521
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,190
The hospital evacuation is still in progress.

522
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,950
There are still a lot of people in here.

523
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,120
Copy that, Curtis.

524
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,450
Edgar, notify LAPD and all relevant agencies.

525
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,800
I want a mandatory evacuation of the downtown core.

526
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,530
Yes, sir.

527
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,310
Jack, Henderson is using an interlaced encryption key.

528
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
What does that mean?

529
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,430
It could take me a half a day to crack it.

530
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,380
Damn it, Chloe, we don't have that kind of time.

531
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,850
I'm sorry. It's a little tougher than it looked at first glance, okay?

532
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,200
Yeah. All right.

533
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,880
Jack, you should know that Curtis and his team

534
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,840
intercepted a terrorist at the hospital.

535
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,480
- Did they take him into custody? - No. He's dead.

536
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,460
But they found a nerve gas canister. They're trying to disarm it now.

537
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,450
There are patients there that can't be evacuated.

538
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,840
Chloe, listen to me. There's nothing you can do about the hospital.

539
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,940
There's still 18 canisters out there. I need you to stay focused.

540
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:53,680
I know.

541
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,720
If I got you more personnel, would that help you crack the code faster?

542
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,980
I've already got three analysts working on it, Jack.

543
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,560
Miriam?

544
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,190
Miriam? Honey, I want you to pack a bag. I want you...

545
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,880
Don't you move!

546
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,880
Miriam, sit back down!

547
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,060
Put your hands behind your head. Get back up on your knees.

548
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,210
Now!

549
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,420
I want you to handcuff yourself. Behind your back.

550
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,660
Get up.

551
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,260
Take a seat next to Miriam on the couch.

552
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,520
- You okay, honey? - I'm okay.

553
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,550
How do I find the nerve gas?

554
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,460
I have no idea what you're talking about.

555
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,390
Where is it?

556
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,590
That's right, Jack. Start at my knee, just like I taught you.

557
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,790
Sooner you do it, sooner you'll see I don't know what you're talking about.

558
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,830
Where is it?!

559
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,050
He doesn't know, Jack! He doesn't know!

560
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,070
For God's sake, leave him alone!

561
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,370
Christopher, CTU found one of the canisters at Tyler Memorial Hospital.

562
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,440
It's armed! People are going to start dying.

563
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,850
How do I find the nerve gas?

564
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,740
Jack, leave him alone! He doesn't know anything!

565
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,840
You really trust him?

566
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,690
Ask him what's in the briefcase.

567
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,220
Unlock it!

568
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,090
Ask him what he's doing with all the money!

569
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,290
- Ask him! - Christopher?

570
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,810
Is this true? Have you been lying to me all this time?

571
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,520
I've been protecting you all this time.

572
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,230
- By lying? - It's not that simple, Miriam.

573
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,860
- I defended you. - I defended you, too,

574
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,430
against things you would not want to know because I love you, Miriam.

575
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,950
There's not one thing I've done out of self-interest or greed.

576
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,470
Even when they fired me-- even when they framed me--

577
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,900
I served my country.

578
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,720
I don't care how you justify this. I am out of time.

579
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,010
You are going to tell me now how to find the rest of the nerve gas.

580
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,820
Oh, go ahead and do it, Jack. Get it done. Shoot me.

581
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,870
Kneecap me. Go ahead and do it. Do it!

582
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,320
- You son of a bitch! - I shot her above the kneecap!

583
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,090
- Son of a bitch! - She can still walk!

584
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,140
You make me shoot her again,

585
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,830
she'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life!

586
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,350
Damn you!

587
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,520
Where do I find the nerve gas?!

588
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,480
Damn you!

589
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,940
Where is it?

590
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,500
Please, please, baby.

591
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,020
Don't you make me do this.

592
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,740
Tell him what he wants to know.

593
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,660
I can't.

594
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,860
I can't.

595
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,750
Forgive me, Miriam. I can't.

596
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,760
You son of a bitch.

597
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,990
You don't care about anybody.

598
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,500
Not even her.

599
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,580
Chloe, this is Jack. I need an ambulance on site.

600
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,780
I repeat: I need an ambulance on site.

601
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,740
Miriam Henderson's been shot in the leg.

602
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,430
I'm bringing Christopher Henderson in to CTU.

603
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,320
I'll need an interrogation room prepped,

604
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,670
and a medic standing by with hyocine-pentothal.

605
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,150
It'll be ready when you get here.

606
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,530
- You okay, Jack? - Yeah, I'm fine.

607
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,420
- Just get the ambulance here now. - Team's on its way.

608
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,930
Put Buchanan on.

609
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,090
Mr. Buchanan, Jack's on line one.

610
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,550
Jack, it's Bill.

611
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,170
What's happening at the hospital?

612
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,070
There's a CRT team on site. Stand by, Jack.

613
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,930
Curtis, what's your status?

614
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,260
We're still trying to defuse the detonator.

615
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,000
Look what we found on the hostile.

616
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,120
Hold on, Bill.

617
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,270
It's a remote timing display.

618
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,910
- Can we defuse the detonator? - Not in 60 seconds.

619
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,560
We'll have to get it out of here.

620
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,860
It could go off if we move it.

621
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,890
It's a chance I'm gonna have to take.

622
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,190
All teams, we're moving the canister to the containment unit.

623
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,230
All right, go, go, go, go, go!

624
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,910
All right, clear the hall! Clear the hall!

625
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,840
We're coming through.

626
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,100
Go, go, go!

627
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,140
Make sure the door is open.

628
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,930
Make sure the door is open.

629
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,510
Upstairs! Upstairs!

630
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,790
Go, go, go! Clear the hall!

631
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,740
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

632
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,920
Keep the hall clear! Coming through!

633
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,420
Get that door open.

634
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,330
Get it in there.

635
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,310
We're clear.

636
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,310
CTU...

637
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,960
the canister detonated inside a containment unit.

638
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,440

Good work, Curtis.

640
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,060
I have the key card.

641
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,940
How long will it take for you to reprogram it?

642
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,920
Five minutes.

643
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,990
Then we will be able to use it to access CTU.

644
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,780
Good.
