1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,300
The terrorists are controlling the main terminal at Ontario Airport.

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,550
Today, your president and the president of Russia

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,800
have come together to sign an anti-terrorism alliance.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,500
I have hostages.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,600
Unless President Logan and President Suvarov

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,700
make a joint statement repudiating this accord,

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,400
I will order their execution.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,100
I want this handled!

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,500
Do you understand?

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,600
I don't care how you do it.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't care what it takes.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,100
Fix it!

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,600
David Palmer called me last night.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,300
He said it was a matter of national security.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,100
Those were his exact words.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,300
I need to talk to you.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,400
It's hardly a matter of national security.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,300
- That's not what he said. - Yes, it is.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,000
No, that is a trick.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,400
I know that all phone conversations are recorded.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,700
Where do they store those transcripts?

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,600
Archive room, down the hall.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,100
This is Bill Buchanan.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,700
I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully.

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,800
I don't think you understand just how serious we are.

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,000
You make any efforts to enter the terminal,

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,700
you will spend the rest of the day collecting body parts.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,800
Jack, I'm going to need you to quarterback this thing from inside.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm staring straight down on the main concourse.

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,900
We've got 6 hostiles wearing explosive vests.

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,500
We have to assume their orders

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
are to detonate if we try to make a move.

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,100
Hey, I got a woman, Diane Huxley,

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,900
says she has info for CTU.

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,200
Diane, what's going on? What's wrong?

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Derek is inside the terminal.

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,300
You!

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No...

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,400
Curtis, they're moving another one of the hostages.

40
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,300
Oh, my God, it's Derek.

41
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,900
You have a problem at the terminal.

42
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,100
Jack Bauer is inside providing recon for CTU's rescue operation.

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
Mr. Bauer,Derek has 5 seconds left to live.

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,800
4...

45
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,300
Beresch!

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,400
The following takes place between 10Am and 11Am

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,100
We've been trying from here,

48
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,000
but we still can't make contact with Jack.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
Can you make a visual, Curtis?

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
Negative.

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Maybe Jack went dark intentionally.

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Unlikely. He was talking to us when his transmission cut off.

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,500
We have to assume he's been captured or killed.

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,000
Which means we need to mount this assault without his help.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,300
Without Jack directing our teams,

56
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,200
success probability falls to less than 20%.

57
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,500
President Logan is going to sign this treaty in less than 1 hour.

58
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,200
If the terrorists are still in control, they'll kill all the hostages.

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,900
What do you want me to do, Bill?

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Work up an assault plan that doesn't include Jack.

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
All right, I'm going back to the staging area.

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,900
We'll coordinate from there.

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,900
Back to your stations.

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,200
Prepare to reconfigure.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,500
All teams, stand down.

66
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,200
We're working up a new mission profile.

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,100
Mr. Bauer,

68
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,900
what is CTU's assault plan?

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
The boy means something to you, otherwise

70
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
you wouldn't have given yourself up so easily.

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,700
Tell me the plan.

72
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,800
They're going to storm the north concourse doors on my command.

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,600
I'm coordinating the operation from in here.

74
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Is there anyone else inside?

75
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,300
No.

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,600
Get me the plans to the terminal.

77
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
You've been a great help.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,900
We'll keep the boy alive from now.

79
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,300
Bring me another hostage.

80
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,400
Anything you do in here today

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,800
will not stop that treaty from being signed.

82
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
The United States Government does not negotiate with

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
terrorists, you know that.

84
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,900
Your President is a weak man.

85
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,100
He'll back down once more blood is spilled.

86
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Not him.

87
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,370
You! Get up!

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Move! Move!

89
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm not your enemy...

90
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,200
Please... Please, you don't have to do this.

91
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,700
- Vlad.I can help you buy more time, - Please!

92
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,700
No! You don't have to do this now.

93
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,200
CTU was supposed to have raided the terminal by now.

94
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,700
Why haven't we heard from them?

95
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,000
Bill Buchanan said they had a setback.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,100
What kind of setback?

97
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,900
They lost contact with Jack Bauer.

98
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Why? What happened to him?

99
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
They're not sure what happened to him,

100
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
but they need to reconfigure their assault plan.

101
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,580
Yeah.

102
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,100
I'll tell the President.

103
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,000
Beresch is transmitting from the terminal.

104
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,700
He's got another hostage.

105
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,850
We have waited patiently for you to renounce this unholy pact

106
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,000
with our oppressors, but we have heard nothing.

107
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
This is the cost of that silence.

108
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,800
What happens next is your choice, Mr. President.

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,100
If you choose to sign this corrupt document,

110
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,600
understand that you will also be staining it with the blood

111
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,540
of the remaining hostages.

112
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,900
If CTU can't pull this off in time,

113
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
that's upwards of 60 people, Mike.

114
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
You know, I've never done anything in my presidency

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
that I didn't feel was right for the country.

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Of course not, Sir.

117
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,300
Nobody thinks otherwise.

118
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,600
I know I'm ambitious,

119
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,700
that I want this treaty to be the hallmark of my presidency,

120
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,900
but I never thought I would sacrifice innocent life.

121
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Mr. President

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,300
you are not responsible for the actions of these murderers.

123
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,400
I could postpone this.

124
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,300
Sir?!

125
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,700
I give them what they want, maybe nobody else has to die.

126
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,800
Do you think these people would actually release the hostages?

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,700
We both know that would never happen.

128
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,400
You're doing the only thing you can do.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,900
Mrs. Logan, if someone altered the recording

130
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,200
of your conversation with David Palmer,

131
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
the President needs to know.

132
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
No. Not now. Not yet.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What are you waiting for?

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Charles is much too preoccupied.

135
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Between the Summit and the hostage situation,

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,500
he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Besides, he thinks I'm unstable.

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Which means I have to show it to him in just the right way.

139
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,500
So, until the treaty is signed,

140
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,700
I'm not letting this out of my sight.

141
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,200
What's happening?

142
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm sorry, I don't have time to explain.

143
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,500
You said you were going in to get the hostages.

144
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,100
We lost contact with Jack.

145
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,200
What does that mean?

146
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
We're not sure what happened.

147
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,900
But we need to change our assault plan.

148
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,600
- Is Jack okay? - We don't know.

149
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,400
What about Derek?

150
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,700
As soon as we get more information, I'll make sure you're told.

151
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,500
- Please, I... - Ms. Huxley...

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,000
I need to go.

153
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,700
The situation continues to grow more tragic.

154
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,300
We've just received a video feed

155
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,200
confirming that another hostage has been executed

156
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,000
inside the main terminal at Ontario Airport.

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,700
Jack...

158
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,300
Don't say anything.

159
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,900
We're going to get through this. Just don't say anything right now.

160
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,800
You're going to call CTU and tell them you've revised your assault profile.

161
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Tell them to come to the emergency door south of gate 12.

162
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
They won't just do that because I ask them to.

163
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,800
They'll need an explanation.

164
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,900
That's your concern, Mr. Bauer.

165
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,900
Overwrite volume four with the approach vectors,

166
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
and re-key with the airport grid.

167
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay, hold on, just for one second.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,500
We don't have one second.

169
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,800
We're running out of time to save the hostages.

170
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,100
Want some help, Spenser?

171
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,500
He doesn't need any help.

172
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,600
Just keep managing the two-ways or else we're gonna have dropout.

173
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Excuse me.

174
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,200
You're Ms. O'Brian, right?

175
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,800
- Who are you? - Lynn McGill. I'm from District.

176
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,600
I met you when you came out for that memory management lecture.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,700
If you say so. What do you need?

178
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,100
- I need to talk to Bill Buchanan. - Is he around?

179
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,600
He's in the Situation Room.He's kind of busy right now.

180
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,700
I see him. Thanks.

181
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,200
I look forward to working with you today.

182
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,000
You don't know who Lynn McGill is, do you?

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,400
No, and I don't care.

184
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,800
Get back to work.

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
Once Curtis and his teams go in there,

186
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,900
I want an update on deployment of HRT.

187
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,400
Mr. Buchanan, I assume they told you I was coming.

188
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,300
Lynn, please... call me Bill.

189
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,700
If we were having a beer or something, but at work,

190
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,290
it's better if we maintain a more formal mode of address.

191
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,000
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,800
Look, we're in the middle of final prep here...

193
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,700
I know, I understand President Logan

194
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,300
wants us to go into the terminal as soon as possible.

195
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,200
Yes, before the treaty is signed.

196
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,400
Is Curtis Manning ready to send his teams in?

197
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
He is, but we're flying blind.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,800
My briefing sheet says that we have Jack Bauer on the inside.

199
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
And we haven't heard from him for close to 20 minutes now.

200
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,900
Well, that's interesting.

201
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Lynn, I read the bulletin from Division,

202
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,300
but I still don't know why you're here.

203
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,100
District was getting heat from the White House.

204
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,300
Heat about what?

205
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,700
Jack Bauer.

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
They just want to know things are running smoothly.

207
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,900
- We're on track, Lynn. - Well, I'm sure you are...

208
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,600
but that's my assignment.

209
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
Is your tactical wired through to all the servers?

210
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,600
Yes, it is, you can go ahead and plug into Station Four.

211
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,300
I'd prefer to work from your office, Mr. Buchanan.

212
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
I hate to displace you, but I think I should have a central vantage point,

213
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,740
and I just want to make sure

214
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,600
that you're okay working from another station.

215
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,000
Fine.

216
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,100
Good.

217
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,600
And, uh, it's not a big deal,

218
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,800
but just so that everyone's clear on the chain of command,

219
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,350
I think you should address me as

220
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,900
Mr. McGill in front of the others.

221
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,800
You know, Lynn, I'd rather not.

222
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,100
Just a suggestion.

223
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,600
Anyway, I need your office.

224
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,800
And that's not a suggestion.

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,060
Fine.

226
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,200
Mr. Buchanan, it's Jack Bauer on line 1.

227
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,000
Is Curtis plugged into this call?

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
I'm on, Bill.

229
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,800
Go ahead, put Jack through.

230
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,500
You're both on with Jack Bauer.

231
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,900
Jack, what happened?

232
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,300
One of the hostiles got too close,

233
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,000
I had to end the transmission.

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
All right, we'll restart the countdown.

235
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,900
Negative, Curtis.

236
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,200
We need to scrap the existing plan,

237
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
find a new breach point.

238
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,100
My men are already in position.

239
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,900
They moved the hostages within the kill zone.

240
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,800
They'll be taken out with the crossfire.

241
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,100
There's an emergency door just south of gate 12.

242
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,600
It's unguarded.

243
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,300
You should be able to punch through with no opposition.

244
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,900
I see it, but I'm not comfortable with this entry point.

245
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,200
It's the only shot we've got.

246
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,900
Are you there now?

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,300
Yes. It's clear.

248
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
I'm in a flank two position.

249
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,300
I repeat, I am in flank two position.

250
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,000
Curtis, how long before your teams can redeploy?

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,900
About 20 minutes.

252
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,700
The President's going to sign that treaty within 30 minutes.

253
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,100
I'll go as fast as I can.

254
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Jack, I'll call you when my men are in position.

255
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
You can call us in.

256
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,900
Copy that. I'll be standing by.

257
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,300
Ivan and Ishmael, stay with the hostages.

258
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,800
The rest of you come here.

259
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,700
Vlad, guard them.

260
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,400
You are doing great.

261
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,500
Manning.

262
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,400
It's Buchanan.

263
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,400
How long until your people are ready to move on the terrorists?

264
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,500
About 15 minutes.

265
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,400
- Why so long?  - When Jack called and changed the breach point,

266
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,800
I had to modify everything, including the explosives.

267
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,400
They have to be repositioned precisely.

268
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Maybe it's a mistake to write down Jack's new information.

269
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,500
It might take too long.

270
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,100
Jack's aware of our deadline.

271
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,400
If he didn't think it was worth the delay

272
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,700
he wouldn't have made the call.

273
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,950
I trust him.

274
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,950
All right, Curtis, 15 minutes.

275
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,390
You have to make this happen.

276
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,790
- I will. -Call when you're in position.

277
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,910
Mr. Buchanan? Mr. McGill needs to see you in his office.

278
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,660
It'll have to wait. Tell him I'm busy.

279
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,070
He said it had to be now.

280
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,390
Fine.

281
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,640
No, I'm settled in fine.

282
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,590
If I need anything, I'll call. Thanks, Donna.

283
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,250
What is it, Lynn?

284
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,910
I'm up to my ears trying to coordinate this hostage situation.

285
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,480
Sit down, Mr. Buchanan.

286
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,060
Would you stop with the "Mr. Buchanan"?

287
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,620
We need to get this assault in motion now.

288
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,790
Sit down, Bill.

289
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,580
I informed the White House

290
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,530
that the rescue operation is back on track.

291
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,390
Thank you.

292
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,440
I must admit, though, I felt a little inappropriate

293
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,290
talking about an operation that I didn't personally review, so

294
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,740
before you send your men into the terminal.

295
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,460
I'd like to see the Playbook.

296
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,990
Look, I can't have you micro-managing my work here, Lynn.

297
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,290
If you want to do my job, just let me know. I'll go home.

298
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,790
Please don't be defensive. I'm not challenging you.

299
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,790
I'm just trying to do my job.

300
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,490
I'll have Chloe send it to your laptop.

301
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,190
Anything else?

302
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,790
That's all for now.

303
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,990
Bill?

304
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,490
Fighting me isn't going to increase our chances

305
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,490
of saving those people's lives.

306
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,830
Lynn wants to look at the revised assault plan.

307
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,310
Send it to him.

308
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,780
Does that mean he's running point, instead of you?

309
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,740
It just means he wants to see the plan, Chloe.

310
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,820
Bill, Curtis just confirmed

311
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,570
that his team will be ready in ten minutes

312
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,490
based on Jack new intel.

313
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,430
As of this time, there is no word as to whether

314
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,930
or not the president is going to call off the signing

315
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,690
of the historic treaty agreement between the United States

316
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,690
and Russia scheduled for just under an hour.

317
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,880
There been any response from the White House

318
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
since we killed the last hostage?

319
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,390
They released their statement confirming the signing

320
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,050
of the treaty is going ahead as planned.

321
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,400
They won't capitulate,as long as they think

322
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,750
their rescue attempt will succeed.

323
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,190
Once we kill them, then they'll realize their options have run out.

324
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,990
The only chance these people had of being rescued is gone because of me.

325
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,490
People were going to die here today, Derek.

326
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,390
That was their plan.

327
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
This is not your fault.

328
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,980
I'm the reason you went along with them.

329
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,500
If I wasn't here...

330
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,690
Stop it.

331
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,690
This is not over.

332
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,290
While there has been no official rebuke of the terrorists' demands

333
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,990
statements from the White House

334
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,890
appear to confirm the president's position

335
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,090
is unchanged, and that the treaty will be signed within the hour,

336
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,790
as scheduled.

337
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,190
That puts the lives of the approximately 60 men,

338
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,400
women and children being held as hostage in question.

339
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,290
Were the terrorists to carry out their intentions...

340
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,090
Good news, Sir.

341
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,510
CTU has reestablished contact with Jack Bauer.

342
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,790
The rescue operation is back on track.

343
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,100
But that's still no guarantee.

344
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,930
- Excuse me, Sir? - The hostages may be killed when we go in there.

345
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,830
Let's be honest.

346
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,830
That's more likely than not.

347
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,390
We don't know that, Sir.

348
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,190
President Suvarov is waiting for you outside.

349
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,830
You're walking outside together onto the stage.

350
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,730
We all agreed to the protocol.

351
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,930
It's time already?

352
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,890
Yes, Sir.

353
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,560
Mr. President.

354
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,680
Shall we?

355
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,500
My people have just informed me that the assault has been delayed.

356
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,080
It's happening now.

357
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,260
It will happen before the treaty is signed.

358
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,340
Don't worry.

359
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,350
Mr. President, like you,

360
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,650
I have staked much of my political future

361
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,350
on the success of this treaty.

362
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,880
If this rescue attempt fails

363
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
it will not only be rendered meaningless,

364
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,960
it will become a mockery.

365
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,640
And so will we.

366
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,100
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan.

367
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,170
The ceremony's beginning any minute.

368
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,990
- She'll be out in a moment. - Oh, may I...

369
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,960
have a word?

370
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,740
You're aware Mrs. Logan was found in one of the archive rooms?

371
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,740
Uh... I don't know anything about that.

372
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,910
Aaron Pierce said you lied to him.

373
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,170
You told him Mrs. Logan was in her room, when

374
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,500
she was actually going through classified documents.

375
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,690
I don't think you understand

376
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,430
just how grave this situation is.

377
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,050
What do you mean?

378
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,400
Mrs. Logan removed a document from the archive

379
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,650
that contains highly-sensitive intelligence protocols.

380
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,380
That's not what she said it was.

381
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,410
What exactly did she say she took?

382
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,740
I think that you should talk to her about this.

383
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,440
Evelyn, this is important.

384
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,560
What did she tell you?

385
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,230
She said it was a transcript of a call she had with David Palmer.

386
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,620
And I'm sure when she said that, she believed it.

387
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,480
You're aware if this document finds its way into the wrong hands,

388
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,780
that you'll be held responsible.

389
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,170
I'm not the one who took it.

390
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,550
No, you aided and abetted.

391
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,110
You'll not only lose your job,

392
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,800
you'll be prosecuted.

393
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,950
That's not fair.

394
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,480
I tried to talk her out of this.

395
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,660
All I'm asking is that you tell me where did she put it.

396
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,650
She has it with her. It's in her blouse.

397
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,860
She said she wouldn't let it out of her sight

398
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,070
until she talked to the president about it.

399
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,470
Walt?

400
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,000
Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm ready now.

401
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,900
Presidents Logan and Suvarov will each make statements,

402
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,080
which will be followed by the signing of the treaty.

403
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,330
How much time will there be between the moment

404
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,580
I step out on stage and when I sign the document?

405
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,150
Not long.

406
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
Does CTU know that's how long

407
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,170
they have to launch the rescue attempt?

408
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:32,580
Yes, Sir.

409
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,630
They're completely synchronized with what's going on here.

410
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,780
I hope so.

411
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,930
The lives of those hostages depend on it.

412
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,270
Today was supposed to be

413
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,750
the crowning achievement of my presidency.

414
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,690
Instead, everybody's waiting to hear

415
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,640
what's going to happen at the airport.

416
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,930
- So, how are you feeling? - I'm fine.

417
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,630
Don't worry about me.

418
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,900
How come you just keep getting better looking as you get older,

419
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,950
and I just keep getting older?

420
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,990
What are you talking about? You're the most beautiful first lady

421
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,460
Pennsylvania Avenue has ever seen.

422
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

423
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,090
President Logan and President Suvarov.

424
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,820
The treaty signing is a minute and a half ahead of schedule.

425
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,450
Should you call Curtis and let him know

426
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,460
he might need to speed up the assault prep?

427
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,920
No. Curtis is moving as fast as he can.

428
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,510
A call from me isn't gonna make him move any faster.

429
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,960
I just thought he might like to...

430
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,450
I said no, Chloe.

431
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,820
The only way to make sure the assault happens in time to save the hostages

432
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,200
is to try to slow down the signing.

433
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,800
- What's wrong with Buchanan? - Nothing.

434
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,530
I think he just realizes we're not gonna be able to save the hostages.

435
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,470
Before we begin the treaty signing

436
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,840
I would like to address

437
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,200
what's happening just a few miles away from here.

438
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,440
As you know, terrorists have already taken innocent life

439
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,100
in an attempt to stop this historic treaty from being signed.

440
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,300
President Suvarov will not let this happen.

441
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,800
I will not let this happen!

442
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,500
Yes, Mike?

443
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,150
Bill I should have heard from you by now.

444
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,240
Have your men gone in yet?

445
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,460
We're not quite ready.

446
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,160
You have to go in now.

447
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,640
- The president's about to sign that treaty. - I understand.

448
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,000
We're pushing as hard as we can.

449
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,190
In the meantime, is there anything you can do on your end?

450
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,190
Like what?

451
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,490
Can you stall things?

452
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,600
Can you slowdown the ceremony?

453
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,540
Bill, the entire world is watching this on live television.

454
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,070
The presidents of the United States and Russia are on stage now.

455
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,170
This process has been set in motion.

456
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,010
No, I can't stall.

457
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,420
Okay, I'll call you back.

458
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,420
No. You stay on the phone with me.

459
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,340
I need to know the moment your people go in.

460
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,550
Yes, Sir.

461
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,010
This barbaric lawlessness

462
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,020
that's taking place at Ontario airport,

463
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:23,630
only underscores the need the necessity for this accord

464
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,740
and for our continued vigilance and commitment

465
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,840
to fighting terrorism around the world.

466
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,690
It looks like President Logan is going through with the signing.

467
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,360
He said he's not going to give in to your demands.

468
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,000
Are you sure this is going to work?

469
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,510
It will work.

470
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,510
And the reason the president is so confident is that

471
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,070
he thinks his rescue attempt will save the day.

472
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,890
Are you sure can end up that assault?

473
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,900
As soon as the CTU agents come through the entry point

474
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,870
that Jack Bauer fed to them,they'll all be killed.

475
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,120
One of the president's aides will then walk up to the podium

476
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,130
and whisper into his hear that there'll be no rescue

477
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,440
that his signature on the treaty

478
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,800
will be the death warrant of the hostages.

479
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,210
That will stop him, I assure you.

480
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,650
Well, just in case you're wrong and he signs the treaty,

481
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,510
you'll be ready to carry out your threat?

482
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,990
Every one of my men is committed to doing what needs to be done today.

483
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,520
We've upgraded our estimate of how many wounded there'll be.

484
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,000
I need ten more ambulances at the airport before we launch.

485
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,910
The rescue operation you're about to execute

486
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,700
is radically changed from your initial approach.

487
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,320
It was revised based on new intelligence from Jack Bauer.

488
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,590
Which he phoned in after being dark for nearly 20 minutes I was there

489
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,730
- Right. - I need to call you back.

490
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,560
Well, I can't say that his explanation

491
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,390
for being out of touch is entirely satisfactory.

492
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,380
Jack said he was trying to avoid detection.

493
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,000
Wh... What are you suggesting?

494
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,300
There's too many unusual circumstances at work here...

495
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,650
I want to try to understand it better

496
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,980
before we send our people in.

497
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,500
I'll need the entire transcripts of your communications

498
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,300
with Mr. Bauer since he's been inside.

499
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,100
To what end?

500
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,910
Thouroughness.

501
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,690
I don't need a sorting run on the calls

502
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,960
just raw transcripts will be fine.

503
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,040
Fine, I'll send them to you.

504
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,790
Thank you.

505
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
Curtis in on line 3.

506
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,590
Curtis, what is your situation?

507
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,690
My men are in place, and we're setting the entry charges.

508
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,420
Any complications?

509
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,190
No

510
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,970
We're also jamming the trigger frequency

511
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,780
so Beresch can't detonate the vests remotely.

512
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,370
We should be able to make our entry on target.

513
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,490
Good.

514
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,570
Stay on the line with me untill we get the go.

515
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,370
O'Brian.

516
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,870
Uh, Miss O'Brian,

517
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,290
I'm trying to understand the transcript of

518
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,710
Jack's last call to CTU,

519
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,030
and there a few items I...

520
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,790
Mr. McGill, I'm really busytrying

521
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,560
to help keep revised assault on schedule...

522
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,250
What do you need?

523
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,790
I understand, and don't want to slow you down,

524
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,240
but I'd appreciate it if you unlock me volume five

525
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,690
there are a few things

526
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,580
- that I'd like to see. - I don't need to know what you'd like to see.

527
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,310
Okay, it's unlocked.

528
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,430
Good.

529
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,680
This Lynn McGill person's really slowing things down.

530
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,030
Yeah, that's his style.

531
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,740
I worked whith him before.

532
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,000
He usualy loses about 20% of his staff in the first

533
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,600
couple of days after taking control of the new office.

534
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,920
That many people quit?

535
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,800
No.

536
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,520
Mostly were fired.

537
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,470
In the volatile climate of twenty 1st century,

538
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,260
the sharing of detering technologies by

539
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,360
responsible powers is the surest guarantee of global peace.

540
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,150
But let this accord be proof that

541
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,930
our two great nation stand together

542
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,690
in their comitment to fight

543
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,390
the enemies of peace and freedom.

544
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,880
Akhmed found Chevensky.

545
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,110
He's dead. He killed himself...

546
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,760
we found him in the baggage room.

547
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,040
What about the key card?

548
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,480
Chevensky had it hidden right where he said he would.

549
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,830
The rest of you will work cleanup on whoever makes it through that line of fire.

550
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,750
Assume CTU is in body armor so go for the head shot.

551
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,660
You... and you,

552
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,480
guard the hostages.

553
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,750
Kill anyone who tries to break away.

554
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,820
Head down!

555
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,100
It is time, the black night is broken

556
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,250
by the dawning of the light of global peace.

557
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,810
Curtis.

558
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,480
Jack, my men are in place.

559
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,510
Okay.

560
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,190
Now, remember, I am in a flank two position...

561
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,420
make sure your men don't hit me when they come in.

562
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,200
Roger that.

563
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,170
Ready to start the countdown on your word.

564
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,060
Jack?

565
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,780
Move in at your discretion.

566
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,940
All teams, we have a green light.

567
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,270
Counting down from 60 seconds on my mark.

568
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,160
Now.

569
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,390
Jack, we'll see you inside.

570
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,270
Everyone, 60 seconds.

571
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
Stop the assault!

572
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,390
Put Curtis on the phone.

573
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,270
What are you talking about?

574
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:02,980
They're walking into a trap.

575
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,210
Look at the transcript.

576
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,880
When Jack issued the command directive

577
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,170
he used the term "Flank two."

578
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,630
Yes, he was trying to give us his position inside the terminal.

579
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,220
No, he wasn't.

580
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,650
"Flank two" is a duress code used to

581
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,080
indicatethe agent is communicating under duress.

582
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,980
We ran Jack's calls through a protocol filter

583
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,490
if there'd been a duress signal in there we would've found it.

584
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,340
You filtered through the current codes.

585
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,450
When Jack was active,

586
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,160
"Flank two" was a duress code.

587
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,040
Chloe, confirm that.

588
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,270
Jack is trying to tell us

589
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,510
he's being used to send misinformation.

590
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,810
If Curtis Manning's teams go in now

591
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,610
they'll be ambushed.

592
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,760
He's right.

593
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,320
Curtis, abort the countdown. Repeat, abort, abort.

594
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,570
Stand down. All teams stand down.

595
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,330
We're aborting entry. Repeat, we're aborting entry.

596
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,730
Confirm that we're standing down. What's wrong Bill?

597
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,070
We detected a duress code in Jack's call.

598
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,230
We have to assume that terrorists are

599
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,000
feeding him the information he gave us.

600
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,980
Redeploy your men according to the original assault plan

601
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,960
and do not contact Jack.

602
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,740
If Jack contacts you, buy time.

603
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,850
Copy that. We're moving.

604
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,900
You're gonna outflank the terrorists?

605
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,090
Yes.

606
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,240
That should work.

607
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,020
All teams, reposition for entry through the east and north gates

608
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,990
plan Bravo repeat plan Bravo

609
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,970
through the east and north gates. Go!

610
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,880
Acknowledged.

611
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Redeploy protocol one.

612
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,040
What's happening?

613
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,070
Ma'am, I need you to step back to the vehicle.

614
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,210
Now.

615
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,250
He said 60 seconds three two ago.

616
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,470
What is CTU waiting for?!

617
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,140
I don't know.

618
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,110
You heard what I heard.

619
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,380
It's Jack.

620
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,400
Jack.

621
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,660
What's happening?

622
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,030
There was a malfunction on the entry charges.

623
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,550
What's the time frame?

624
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,280
Any minute.

625
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,030
They're resetting the detonators.

626
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,910
Stand by.

627
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,460
Copy that.

628
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,090
They're in position.

629
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,230
Stay ready!

630
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,740
Yeah.

631
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,930
Is it done?

632
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,520
No. CTU hasn't attacked yet.

633
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,450
You said it would happen before the signing.

634
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,070
And you told me the president would never let it go this far.

635
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,020
He's signing it.

636
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,610
You have no choice.

637
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,200
Kill them all.

638
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,410
No!

639
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,000
You okay?

640
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,120
Yeah.

641
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,080
We secure the terminal besides the hostiles

642
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,920
there appears to be no further casualties.

643
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,760
Repeat remaining hostages are unharmed.

644
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,620
Good work, Curtis.

645
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,110
You get that, Mike?

646
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,050
Got it. Thanks for the good work.

647
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,650
Mr. President, I have some good news.

648
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:44,080
I have just received word that the crisis at the Ontario Airport is over.

649
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,960
The rescue operation that I authorized was successful.

650
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,200
The terrorists have been captured or killed.

651
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,790
And, best of all

652
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,250
this has all been accomplished with no further loss of innocent life.

653
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,300
Excuse me agent!

654
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,480
My name is Jack Bauer.

655
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,620
I know who you are, Sir.

656
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,870
Can I use your pick?

657
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,690
This is Derek Huxley.

658
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,800
His mother is waiting for him at the command post.

659
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,360
- Can you please take him there? - Of course.

660
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,350
What about you?

661
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,640
Come here.

662
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,120
I have to finish this.

663
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,800
Go take care of your mother.

664
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,440
- Yeah. - Okay.

665
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,600
Go.

666
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I'm missing one.

667
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,390
Everybody, I need your attention.

668
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,160
We're looking for a man who was being held here with you.

669
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,070
He's a white male, mid-30s.

670
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,950
He was wearing a bright yellow tie.

671
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,380
Did anyone see him leave?

672
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,230
Anyone?

673
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:21,000
Keep the hostages here until I get back.

674
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,790
Mom!

675
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,340
Derek!

676
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,900
They were going to kill me.

677
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,950
Jack saved my life.

678
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,830
He saves everyone's life.

679
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,510
Mrs. Huxley,

680
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,810
I need you and your son to follow me.

681
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,200
Can I see Jack Bauer?

682
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,320
I'm sorry, I have instructions to transport you to CTU.

683
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,560
This way, please.

684
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,180
Mister President.

685
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,860
Thank you very much.

686
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,240
Thank you.

687
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,930
- Charles? - Oh, watch your step honey.

688
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,610
I need to talk to you.

689
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,150
Sweetheart...smile, it's over.

690
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,950
Charles, I just need a few minutes alone with you.

691
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:47,180
- Yes soon. - No! Not soon, right now... this is very important.

692
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,420
Martha, when I am done with this, I'll call for you.

693
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,630
- I promise. - All right this ends now.

694
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,990
I have played my role without interfering.

695
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,070
Now it is time for you to attend to me.

696
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,800
- And I will. - Charles, do not patronize me!

697
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Something is going on.

698
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,810
- I am not crying wolf again. - Martha...

699
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:14,560
Please do not ruin this moment for me.

700
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,480
We'll talk later.

701
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,780
Martha. Everything all right?

702
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,240
No, it's not all right.

703
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,960
I have to talk to my husband.

704
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,300
The situation is more dangerous than he realizes.

705
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,770
Whoa, and what situation is that?

706
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,580
I'm sorry, Walt.

707
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,150
I can only talk to Charles about this.

708
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,350
Curtis just confirmed the area's been contained and

709
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,900
they're reporting only minor injuries among the hostages.

710
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,650
Good, thank you.

711
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,480
You should probably route all field updates through Mr. McGill

712
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,230
for the time being.

713
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,300
Okay.

714
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,460
Bill, if you have a moment.

715
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,270
Lynn, uh.I owe you an apology.

716
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,120
For what?

717
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,170
Well, if you hadn't recognized the duress code

718
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,220
that Jack transmitted, well...

719
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,000
Bill, you're the reason I figured out what he was doing.

720
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,720
What do you mean?

721
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,120
Well, I admit, I was suspicious of Mr. Bauer

722
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,010
but you were so adamant about his integrity that I just...

723
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,360
looked for a way to reconcile the contradiction, so...

724
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,870
thank you.

725
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,370
I assume Mr. Bauer's been taken into custody?

726
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,800
Well, I plan to debrief him here

727
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,230
but not as a suspect.

728
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,130
Well, he hasn't been officially cleared in the deaths

729
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,030
of David Palmer or Michelle Dessler.

730
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,560
Well, based on mitigating evidence in Chloe O'Brian's testimony

731
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,530
we're confident that Jack was framed for those murders.

732
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,530
I appreciate that,

733
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,820
but it still doesn't change a very tangled situation.

734
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,910
I mean, we have surveillance footage that places

735
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,200
Jack Bauer at the site of David Palmer's assassination.

736
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,510
Well, clearly, it was doctored.

737
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,360
Not according to preliminary tests.

738
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,570
If we're gonna get to the bottom of this,

739
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,330
Jack Bauer has a lot to answer for.

740
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,740
Bring him in now.

741
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,030
The rest of the terminal's clear.

742
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,500
Jack.

743
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,640
It's good to see you again.

744
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,540
It's good to see you.

745
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,710
We've got a problem

746
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,330
one of the hostages is missing.

747
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,770
He was working with the terrorists.

748
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,110
Give me a description, I'll take care of it.

749
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,240
I'll help you now... let's go.

750
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,520
Jack, you need to go back to CTU.

751
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,970
Buchanan just gave orders to take you into custody.

752
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,820
I watched Beresch give this guy a key card.

753
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,620
Something else is going down here.

754
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,090
- We've got to find this guy now. - And I'll get right on it,

755
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,250
but I need you to go with these men, please.

756
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,700
He's a white male,

757
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,960
mid-30s, wearing a dark suit and a yellow tie.

758
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,360
He's about five-eight.

759
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,830
We'll find him.

760
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,990
Okay. Thanks.

761
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,350
These are my weapons.

762
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,780
Altieri, Hutchinson

763
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,680
we have a possible sleeper among the hostages.

764
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,710
We're looking for a Caucasian male

765
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,650
We're looking for a Caucasian male five-eight, dark suit, yellow tie.

766
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,730
Where have you been?

767
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,700
We had a problem with Chevensky.

768
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,840
Where is he?

769
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,950
Dead.

770
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,160
You have the key?

771
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,180
Masks.

772
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,730
All right, now.

773
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,040
One, two, three.

774
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,630
Push it, push it.

775
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,520
Do you have the merchandise?

776
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,790
Yes, we're moving the canisters out now.

777
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,700
Good.

778
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,200
Transportation's been arranged.

779
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,350
Call me when you're out.

780
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,660
I will.

781
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,580
Evelyn, did you get a chance to speak to my husband?
