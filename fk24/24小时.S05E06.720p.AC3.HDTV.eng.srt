1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,180
Any problems getting the canisters out?

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,980
No. They were hidden exactly where you said they'd be.

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,350
Russians will finally understand the consequences

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,210
of occupying our homeland when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,840
Erwich has just cleared airport security.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,780
Then the authorities don't know anything's been stolen.

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,870
Not yet.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,770
Then the only thing we have left to take care of is Bauer.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,860
You paged me?

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,110
I need you to do something.

11
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,500
We have our hands full searching for the nerve gas.

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,630
Bauer is a priority.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,040
I just signed a treaty.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,630
Now all of a sudden

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,670
I find out that the terrorists

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,010
are still out there... with nerve gas.

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,180
You people have to listen to me.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,460
I had a document.

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,730
It was hidden in my blouse.

20
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,360
It's gone.

21
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,350
Someone stole it from me.

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,370
This is what she was like before you sent her to Vermont.

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,100
Are you suggesting that I readmit her?

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,770
For her sake,

25
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,510
if nothing else.

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,300
Aaron, my wife is gone.

27
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,630
We have a priority alert.

28
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,560
You've been burrowing into classified CTU protocols without authorization.

29
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

30
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,310
Stop.

31
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,250
I know you logged on to the security subsystem

32
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,360
where you had no right to be.

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,830
Someone knew that Jack was alive.

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,200
It's critical to our investigation

35
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,860
that we find out who that was.

36
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,740
Did you let that man into CTU?

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,780
This man is a professional assassin.

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,680
He just killed Dr. Paulson, he tried to kill me.

39
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,090
Who told you to let that man into CTU?

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,430
The White House.

41
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,240
Mr. Cummings.

42
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,770
The following takes place between 12Pm and 1Pm

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,470
I don't understand the problem.

44
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,690
David Palmer was murdered because he was about

45
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,430
to expose Walt Cummings' connection to the terrorists.

46
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,210
When Cummings failed to frame me for Palmer's murder,

47
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,190
he tried to kill me.

48
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,840
All that may be true, Jack

49
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,660
but we don't have proof.

50
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,320
We can prove that Cummings used

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,980
Spenser to get Jack's assassin into CTU.

52
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,070
All we have is Spenser's word.

53
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,260
That's not enough to build a case.

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,800
You don't have time to build a case.

55
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,750
You want the nerve gas,

56
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,020
Cummings is your connection.

57
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,930
Cummings is the President's Chief Advisor.

58
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,270
How exactly do you suggest we get to him?

59
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,450
I can secretly meet with Mike Novick

60
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,400
enlist his help.

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,430
How do we know Novick's not in this with Cummings?

62
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,150
Because I know him.

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,080
He'll listen to me.

64
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,900
And the President will listen to him.

65
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,420
With Novick's help, we can isolate Cummings.

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,150
Jack, as much as I appreciate you wanting to be involved

67
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,790
you don't work here anymore.

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
That's exactly the reason why I should do this.

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,220
If it backfires, there'll be no fallout on you.

70
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,880
I think it's worth a try.

71
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,480
I agree.

72
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,830
It's your call.

73
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,230
All right, Jack.

74
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,420
But just so we're clear,

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
this is about finding the nerve gas,

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,550
not getting revenge for David Palmer.

77
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,490
Understood.

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Work out your protocols with Ms. Raines.

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,590
We'll keep looking through Cummings' background

80
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,830
for anything that supports our case.

81
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,460
We're gonna need to set up a secure channel

82
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,360
for you to contact us on.

83
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,660
Can you bring up the satellite photo of the compound?

84
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,530
Jack, I'm sorry if I'm being a little distant.I just...

85
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,970
It's taking me a little while to get used to you being alive.

86
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,690
I understand.

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll call Novick.

88
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,000
Jack.

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,490
When Cummings finds out that you're still alive,

90
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,490
he's gonna come after you again.

91
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,560
Yeah.

92
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,900
Yes?

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,150
Is Bauer dead?

94
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,730
I haven't received confirmation yet.

95
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,830
Your man should have taken care of this by now.

96
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,000
Perhaps he had to alter his strike window.

97
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,330
Has the nerve gas reached the port?

98
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,090
Not yet.

99
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,940
But they should be arriving any minute.

100
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,290
Good.

101
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,810
I have to go.

102
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,290
I'm late for a briefing.

103
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,620
You have all the shipping documents in order?

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,070
The canisters will arrive at port

105
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,590
in your country in eight days.

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,390
Ground transportation to your base camp will take another day.

107
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,180
Will you need my help getting them to your target?

108
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,880
No.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,920
I've arranged transport to Moscow.

110
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,350
Have they found my wife yet?

111
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,870
No, sir,

112
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,440
but Secret Service is confident

113
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,610
she's still on the grounds.

114
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,760
If they're so damn confident,

115
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,730
why can't anyone find her?

116
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,840
What the hell are they doing?

117
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,410
I'm sure it's just a matter of time

118
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,490
Mr. President.

119
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,170
Sorry I'm late.

120
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,610
I was just setting up the video.

121
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,170
This was made by terrorists,

122
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,550
to document the effects of exposure to nerve gas.

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,030
It was recovered from a training camp two years ago.

124
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,000
Disorientation occurs moments after exposure.

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,280
Now the video jumps forward

126
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,860
no more than a couple of minutes, we estimate.

127
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,000
Within that time,

128
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,200
there's permanent damage to the central nervous system.

129
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,260
Violent seizures take over.

130
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,890
Bronchial membranes blister and peel away.

131
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,290
Death occurs within...

132
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,230
Stop.

133
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,130
Now, according to DOD,

134
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,380
the Sentox-Six nerve gas stolen from the airport

135
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,280
is far more lethal than the gas we just saw used.

136
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,370
If released in a town or city, for example,

137
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,390
the cloud will remain lethal for much longer.

138
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,060
Are we any closer to finding the canisters?

139
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,000
There haven't been any reports of progress, sir.

140
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,900
Excuse me, Mr. President.

141
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,720
I need to return a call to the State Department.

142
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,830
Do you have those updates, Walt?

143
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,790
Yes, here's one from CTU.

144
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,820
Also one from Homeland Security.

145
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,600
This is Bauer.

146
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,950
Jack. Mike Novick.

147
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,760
It's good to hear your voice.

148
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,280
Yours, too, Mike.

149
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,090
I'm so sorry about David Palmer.

150
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,270
I know how much he meant to you.

151
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,180
Yeah...

152
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,530
What's going on?

153
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,590
I have a lead on the stolen nerve gas.

154
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,900
Isn't CTU coordinating the search?

155
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,480
This is something I need to bring directly to you.

156
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,800
I don't understand.

157
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,810
I can't talk about it on the phone, Mike.

158
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,220
We need to meet.

159
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,520
No one can know about this, not even the President.

160
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,850
I'm not comfortable with all this secrecy, Jack.

161
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,960
You need to give me some idea what this is about.

162
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,270
It concerns Walt Cummings.

163
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,220
There's an area

164
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,160
a few hundred yards outside the southwest gate.

165
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,790
It's at the far side of the property from the main house.

166
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
Thanks, Mike.

167
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,020
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

168
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,510
Jack...

169
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,520
Hey.

170
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,290
They said we can leave soon.

171
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,140
I know, I heard.

172
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,810
What about you?

173
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,700
Are you coming home with us?

174
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,570
No, I need to stay here.

175
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,830
CTU still needs my help.

176
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,510
Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment

177
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,180
is that all right?

178
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,810
Yeah, of course.

179
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,990
Take him downstairs.

180
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,520
She'll be there soon.

181
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,690
You're not coming back to us at all, are you?

182
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,190
No.

183
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,580
I never thought I was going to be back here at CTU.

184
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,310
I would never have gotten you involved

185
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,400
in all of this, I promise you.

186
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,570
It's the woman who interviewed me, isn't it? Audrey Raines.

187
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,130
You were involved with her.

188
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,230
I could tell by the way you looked at each other.

189
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,160
I was with her before I had to disappear.

190
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,130
Are you still in love with her?

191
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,070
Yes.

192
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,420
Does she still love you?

193
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,560
I don't know.

194
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,050
Mr. Bauer.

195
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,940
Your transportation's standing by.

196
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,300
I'll be right there.

197
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,110
I'm sorry, I have to go.

198
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,370
Thank you.

199
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,450
Thank you.

200
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,490
I'm not comfortable with all this secrecy, Jack.

201
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,510
You need to give me some idea what this is about.

202
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,490
It concerns Walt Cummings.

203
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,270
There's an area,

204
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,450
a few hundred yards outside the southwest gate.

205
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,690
It's at the far side of the property from the main house.

206
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Your man didn't do his job.

207
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,530
Don't put that on me, Nathanson.

208
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,870
You were supposed to have Bauer killed hours ago.

209
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,340
I'm not going to warn you again.

210
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,960
Pull yourself together.

211
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,270
You heard the call, didn't you?

212
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,280
Bauer's coming here to expose my role in all this.

213
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,800
You're assuming he knows the extent of it.

214
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,920
Well, it's obvious he knows enough.

215
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,970
Now, what the hell am I supposed to do?

216
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,520
At this point

217
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
there's only one thing you can do.

218
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,890
Mrs. Logan,

219
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,120
please come out of there.

220
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:45,910
Mrs. Logan...

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,670
Aaron...

222
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,370
don't let them take me.

223
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,910
You've got to listen to me.

224
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,810
They're just trying to help you.

225
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:58,440
No.

226
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,190
No.

227
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,850
They're trying to set me up.

228
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,920
They're trying to make it look like I had a breakdown

229
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,460
so they can cart me off to some psychiatric hospital.

230
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,210
Ma'am...

231
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:05,990
Aaron...

232
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,460
It's someone in my husband's administration.

233
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,600
They're trying to shut me up

234
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
because I know the truth.

235
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,290
What truth?

236
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,770
David Palmer.

237
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,830
I know...

238
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
Don't let him take me, Aaron. Please?

239
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,250
We have our orders, Mrs. Logan.

240
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,530
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,750
Aaron... please...

242
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,240
Aaron...

243
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,650
Audrey

244
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,390
did you check with the airports?

245
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,120
Yes. They've all been alerted on the missing canisters.

246
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,160
And CHP?

247
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,800
Same thing.

248
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,840
Trucks are being checked at all major interstates.

249
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,670
Make sure there's no mention of the Sentox nerve gas.

250
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,850
The White House is clear about that.

251
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,280
Yes, I know.

252
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,220
The bulletin only describes the missing canisters.

253
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,830
There's no mention of chemical weapons.

254
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,280
Good.

255
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,560
The last thing we need is for the public

256
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,930
to find out that nerve gas is out there.

257
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,160
Schaeffer...

258
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,210
...what were you doing in there?

259
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,530
Making sure the canisters were secured properly.

260
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,710
Don't want them knocking around

261
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,230
when this gets loaded onto a ship.

262
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,520
My men secured the canisters according to my instructions.

263
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,150
You don't need to be concerned.

264
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,630
All right.

265
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,730
Here are the customs documents you need

266
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,760
when the shipment arrives,

267
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,910
along with the remote trigger

268
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,910
and the arming codes.

269
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,920
I'll take the rest of my payment now.

270
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,240
Our arrangement was you'll get your final installment

271
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,200
when the ship left port.

272
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,730
There's not gonna be a problem.

273
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,010
They're loading out in less than an hour.

274
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,930
Then you won't have long to wait.

275
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,570
Fine.

276
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,480
Ms. Raines?

277
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,670
Yes.

278
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,820
We've been released.

279
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, good.

280
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,800
Can I ask you something?

281
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,720
Of course.

282
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,400
Do you still have feelings for Jack?

283
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,190
I'm sorry, but that's personal.

284
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,000
I know, but he's been living with my son and me for the last six months.

285
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,400
We started to become a family...

286
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,800
...and I care about him.

287
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,420
Do you know he still loves you?

288
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,300
If you don't love him, let him go.

289
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,590
Bauer.

290
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,920
Jack, it's Audrey.

291
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,930
What's going on?

292
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,700
Jack...

293
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,250
What?

294
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,700
Audrey, what?

295
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,000
When this is over,

296
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,420
are you coming back?

297
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,360
I don't know.

298
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,290
Are you going back to Diane?

299
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,530
No...

300
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,580
I don't know what I'm doing yet.

301
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,510
I haven't had any time to think about it.

302
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,880
Is it true what she said?

303
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,510
What'd she say?

304
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,210
That you still love me.

305
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,980
I never stopped loving you...

306
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,150
not for one second.

307
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
Then don't go away again, Jack, please.

308
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,960
It's more complicated than that.

309
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,950
I know.

310
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,780
It's time.

311
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,170
I gotta go.

312
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,060
Jack...

313
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,470
I have to go.

314
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,700
Yeah, I know, I know. Okay. Bye.

315
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,570
No, no!

316
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,800
Keep me out of this!

317
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,780
The last thing I want to do is comment to the press

318
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,630
about the roadblocks going up.

319
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,700
And we can't have any leaks about the nerve gas.

320
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,630
It would just cause a panic.

321
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,030
Come in.

322
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,690
Pardon me, sir.

323
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,660
We found Mrs. Logan.

324
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,660
Is she all right?

325
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,430
She's fine, sir.

326
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,400
She was hiding in the stables.

327
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,810
Stables? What the hell

328
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,900
did she think she was doing?

329
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,560
Mr. President...

330
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,340
I feel awkward mentioning this, but...

331
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,600
Mrs. Logan said some things...

332
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,460
About David Palmer.

333
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,660
Yes, sir.

334
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,520
I've heard her conspiracy theories, Aaron.

335
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,580
I've heard them all.

336
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,730
But thank you for your concern, Aaron.

337
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,480
They found my wife.

338
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,440
Good.

339
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,240
Mr. President...

340
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,290
we need to talk.

341
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,250
What is it, Walt?

342
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,310
I was hoping to spare you from this

343
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,690
but I'm afraid Jack Bauer is forcing my hand.

344
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,740
He's on his way here to meet with Mike Novick.

345
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,860
Bauer? Why?

346
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,820
He's going to accuse me

347
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,320
of helping the terrorists acquire the nerve gas.

348
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,820
That's ridiculous.

349
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,670
No, sir.

350
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,090
It's the truth.

351
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,930
What did you say?

352
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,060
Through a proxy, I leaked

353
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,970
information to the terrorists

354
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,000
about where the nerve gas was hidden.

355
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,210
You have to understand, sir,

356
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,810
this gas was never going

357
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,860
to pose a threat to American lives.

358
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,640
Never pose a threat?!

359
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,590
People died in the airport!

360
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,810
Hostages were killed!

361
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,560
We had hoped to limit the collateral damage.

362
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,550
"Collateral damage"?!

363
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,370
What are you thinking?

364
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,990
This is an unspeakable crime.

365
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,550
Walt... you have to answer for this.

366
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,240
Mr. President...

367
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,450
it's in your best interest to hear me out

368
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,000
before you make that phone call.

369
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,840
What do you mean

370
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,420
"my best interest"?

371
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,380
Sentox gas is being smuggled out of the country

372
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,370
by separatists who think they are going to use it

373
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,560
against the Russians.

374
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,700
However, that nerve gas will never reach Russian soil.

375
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
And you know this how?

376
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,070
We control the remote detonators on those

377
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,690
gas canisters.

378
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,020
As soon as they reach the terrorists' base,

379
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,630
we'll trigger the canisters by satellite

380
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,570
and release the gas.

381
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,140
So everything that happened today

382
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,410
was just to kill a some terrorists?

383
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,900
No, the goal is to produce a smoking gun,

384
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,510
proof of the existence

385
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,100
of weapons of mass destruction in Central Asia.

386
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,160
This is unbelievable.

387
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,700
It's necessary.

388
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,090
It will finally give us a pretext

389
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,330
to increase our military presence in the region,

390
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,460
guaranteeing the flow of oil for the next generation.

391
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,860
How dare you.

392
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,180
How dare you act without my consent.

393
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,180
How dare you put this administration

394
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,330
this entire country in jeopardy.

395
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,000
You're a traitor.

396
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,950
No, no,

397
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,550
Mr. President,

398
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,550
I am a patriot!

399
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,640
Doing what needs to be done

400
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,200
for the continued safety and well-being of this nation!

401
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,800
My God...

402
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,200
you gave the order to have David Palmer killed.

403
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,840
That was an unfortunate

404
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,560
but necessary intervention.

405
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,220
He found out too much and we had...

406
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,070
Walt!

407
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,560
You're rationalizing murder

408
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,000
the murder of a president.

409
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,290
You're going to contact these people

410
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,260
and recover the nerve gas before it leaves the country.

411
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,210
I'm afraid I can't do that.

412
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,920
Why not?

413
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,800
I don't know where the nerve gas is.

414
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,590
And the man I have working inside

415
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,910
has gone dark-- he's unreachable.

416
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,070
Now, you'll let things play out as they are.

417
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,810
Otherwise, your administration will be implicated

418
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,100
and your presidency will be destroyed.

419
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,160
It's your choice Mr.President.

420
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,660
Jack.

421
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,230
Thanks for seeing me like this, Mike.

422
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,840
What is it?

423
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,890
Did you tell anyone we were meeting?

424
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,270
Of course not.

425
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,650
Son of a bitch!

426
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,290
Who did you tell?

427
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,710
Who did you tell?!

428
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,150
I didn't tell anybody, Jack!

429
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,780
Jack Bauer, stay right where you are.

430
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,860
Put down your weapons and put your hands up.

431
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,620
What's the meaning of this?!

432
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,390
Tell your men to stand down!

433
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,460
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.

434
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,220
He's here at my request!

435
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,170
We have orders to use force if necessary.

436
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,490
Orders? From who?

437
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,260
The President of the United States.

438
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,720
Get on your knees.

439
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,300
Thanks.

440
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,960
Novick and Bauer have been taken into custody.

441
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,880
So we're just gonna lock Mike Novick up?

442
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,280
For the time being.

443
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,140
Well, what good will it do?

444
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,160
Eventually, he's gonna get out,

445
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,650
and he's gonna talk to the press.

446
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,460
What can he say?

447
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,430
He doesn't know anything.

448
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,170
I thought you told me

449
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,610
he talked to Jack Bauer.

450
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,980
We stopped Bauer before he could give Mike any details.

451
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,250
What's he gonna think?

452
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,130
We're detaining him.

453
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,770
Bauer was about to divulge national security secrets

454
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,040
that Mike's not authorized to hear.

455
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,000
That's why Mike's being detained.

456
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,210
And what about Bauer?

457
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,660
He must have talked to other people at CTU

458
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,400
and told them what he knows.

459
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,030
As soon as this

460
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,190
nerve gas leaves U.S. soil,

461
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,690
it's gonna be very difficult to prove

462
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,660
that either of us is connected to this in any way.

463
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,640
And you're sure

464
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,820
that these-these-these detonators will work,

465
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,450
that the Sentox gas will be released before it can be used

466
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,640
against the Russians?

467
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,020
Yes.

468
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,800
Right now all you need to do

469
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,330
is authorize me to terminate CTU's involvement in this matter.

470
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,840
We'll tell them we've got the situation under control

471
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,270
and that we'll deal with Bauer.

472
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,580
Who, after all,

473
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,560
is not officially affiliated with them any longer.

474
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,340
All right.

475
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,490
Good.

476
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,460
Yes?

477
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,000
Mr. President, I have Mrs. Logan for you.

478
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,730
Not now.

479
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,470
Yes, sir.

480
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,940
Dunley.

481
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,750
What is Jack Bauer doing here,

482
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,910
why is he under arrest,

483
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,400
and why wasn't I told?

484
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,000
Orders of the president.

485
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,240
Directly?

486
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,660
No. It came through Walt Cummings' office.

487
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,390
Okay.

488
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,720
Thank you.

489
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,240
We're no longer running point on the search for the canisters.

490
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,930
We've been ordered off by Division.

491
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:36,890
Why?

492
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,040
The White House wants to use their own people to coordinate from now on.

493
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,760
That doesn't make sense

494
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,330
we'll waste hours

495
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,010
getting another agency up to speed.

496
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,270
Yeah, I know.

497
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,320
I tried calling the president.

498
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,260
He's not taking my calls.

499
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
What about Mike Novick?

500
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,370
Jack should be with him by now.

501
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,600
Novick's people say he's unreachable,

502
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,800
and Jack's cell goes right to voice-mail.

503
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,830
Something's wrong.

504
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,810
Yeah, I know,

505
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,520
but I don't know what we can do about it.

506
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:53,910
I do.

507
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:54,940
What?

508
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,820
We can disregard the order.

509
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,320
We're not disregarding a presidential order.

510
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,440
If we don't, we will not find this nerve gas.

511
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,470
Sending Jack Bauer

512
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,940
to have a conversation with Mike Novick

513
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,770
as a private citizen is one thing,

514
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,420
but I'm not about to start considering disobeying

515
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,540
a direct order from the White House.

516
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,280
That's because you don't have the experience

517
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,240
to know any better.

518
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,360
Mr. Buchanan,

519
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,000
will you step outside for a moment?

520
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,510
I can't have you talking to me like that

521
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,160
in front of these people.

522
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,880
You're right. I'm sorry.

523
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,760
Are we clear about who's in charge here?

524
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,010
Yeah, but my advice stands.

525
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,990
If this order jeopardizes

526
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,070
our chances of finding that nerve gas,

527
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,320
it's your responsibility to ignore it--

528
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,000
at least until we can make our case to the White House.

529
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,750
You also need to learn to make decisions faster.

530
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,310
Bill...

531
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,200
One more thing that comes with experience.

532
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,390
Lynn,

533
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,180
if we don't do everything in our power

534
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,250
to stop these terrorists,

535
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,730
we're not doing our job.

536
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,760
Okay,

537
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,720
disregard the order.

538
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,260
Thank you.

539
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,900
Is there anything else you'd like me to pack for you?

540
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,330
Maybe a few of your...

541
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,700
nicer dresses?

542
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,590
I'm being confined to a psychiatric ward, Evelyn.

543
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,080
I don't think there are

544
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,950
gonna be any black-tie events.

545
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,120
Sorry.

546
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,340
How'd this happen?

547
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,260
What's that, Mrs. Logan?

548
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,170
Charles and me.

549
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,690
I was his confidante.

550
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,350
All those years in Congress, my... opinion

551
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,100
was the one that mattered most to him.

552
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,130
And now I'm...

553
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,500
...less than an afterthought.

554
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,550
I'm sure the president would be here

555
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,590
if he could.

556
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,950
He's the President of the United States,

557
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,450
Evelyn.

558
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,540
He can do whatever he wants.

559
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,050
If he wanted to be here,

560
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,000
he would be.

561
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,100
Mr. Bauer,

562
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,740
you're being moved

563
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,000
per the president's orders.

564
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,880
Where?

565
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,950
To a class three detention facility.

566
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,760
On what charges?

567
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,360
I was invited here by Mike Novick.

568
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,000
Those are my orders, sir.

569
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,410
You're Pierce, right?

570
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,650
Aaron Pierce. You served under David Palmer.

571
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,820
Yes, I did.

572
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,790
I need to speak with you just for a moment, please.

573
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,580
That's not possible.

574
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,390
It concerns David Palmer's killer.

575
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,230
All right.

576
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,600
David Palmer was assassinated

577
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,780
because he was on the verge of discovering

578
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,280
that the terrorists that attacked us today

579
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,910
were being helped by someone

580
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,000
within Logan's administration.

581
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,660
Who?

582
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,650
Walt Cummings.

583
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,860
Why would Mr. Cummings be involved

584
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,380
with terrorists?

585
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,840
I couldn't tell you.

586
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,200
But I can tell you

587
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,360
that the terrorists are now in possession

588
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,880
of a weaponized nerve gas,

589
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,370
and Walt Cummings may be

590
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,750
the last chance we have to stop them in time.

591
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,330
Walt Cummings ordered the

592
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,210
assassination of David Palmer.

593
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,130
I know that's hard to believe,

594
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,550
but I can prove it, it's true.

595
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,980
Actually, it's not that hard to believe.

596
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,700
The First Lady also thinks

597
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,460
someone in the administration was involved.

598
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,890
Your primary responsibility as lead agent

599
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,620
is to protect the President

600
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,160
of the United States.

601
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,130
Someone in his administration

602
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,700
is undermining his authority.

603
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,360
That is equivalent to a coupd tat.

604
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,690
Agent Pierce, please...

605
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,010
please, I need your help.

606
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,210
Bauer's escaped.

607
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,600
When? I didn't get a code alert.

608
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,270
My comm's down.

609
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,730
Call it in, have agents cover the west gate--

610
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,900
that's where he was headed.

611
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,680
What about you?

612
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,620
I'll take your post.

613
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,000
Go.

614
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:12,960
Yes, sir.

615
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That was NSA

616
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,870
CTU hasn't transferred

617
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,260
the search operation to their jurisdiction yet.

618
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,060
What's the problem?

619
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,080
I don't know.

620
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,470
But you need to call Lynn McGill,

621
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,820
make sure we're in charge of this.

622
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,690
I've been avoiding his calls because

623
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,460
he's just gonna ask me

624
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,520
why I'm pulling CTU off the search operation

625
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,050
and I don't know what to tell him!

626
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,070
You don't have to tell him anything.

627
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,820
You're the president.

628
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:38,810
Agent Pierce,

629
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,010
we're in the middle of a meeting

630
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,030
if you don't mind.

631
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,840
Mr. President

632
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,670
my name is Jack Bauer

633
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,850
and I'm sorry to have to confront you like this

634
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,980
but your chief of staff is withholding information

635
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,700
that is vital to this nation's security.

636
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,720
Stop this!

637
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,190
I'm the President of the United States--

638
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,380
get your hands off this man!

639
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,170
Agent Pierce, do something!

640
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,890
I am, Mr. President.

641
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,220
I'm upholding my oath to protect you.

642
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,000
That won't have any effect, sir.

643
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,810
I've overridden the distress line.

644
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,680
Mr. Cummings is guilty of conspiring with terrorists.

645
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,330
He facilitated the theft of a military-grade nerve gas,

646
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,110
and today is responsible for

647
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,160
the death of at least three people,

648
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,600
including David Palmer.

649
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,250
I know about that,

650
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,000
but there's an explanation.

651
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,700
What do you mean, you know about that?

652
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,120
Mr. Bauer, please,

653
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,640
I just found out a couple minutes ago.

654
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,890
It's very complicated.

655
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,330
I don't know what this man has told you,

656
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,580
but we need to find that nerve gas now,

657
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,620
and I mean immediately

658
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,720
before it is too late.

659
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,000
It's already too late.

660
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,000
What do you mean?

661
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,320
Apparently, it's on its way out of the country.

662
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:42,810
Where is it?!

663
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,620
He told me he doesn't know!

664
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,130
He's lying to you, sir!

665
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,120
The man I have inside has gone dark,

666
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,240
I don't know.

667
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,100
I'm done talking with you,

668
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,940
you understand me?

669
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,580
Now you read my file.

670
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,400
First thing I'm going to do,

671
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,470
I'm going to take out your right eye

672
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,640
then I'm going to move over

673
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,510
and I'm going to take our your left.

674
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,180
And then I'm going to cut you.

675
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,190
I'm going to keep cutting you

676
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,940
until I get the information that I need,

677
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,380
you understand me?

678
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,210
So for the last time, where is the nerve gas?

679
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,520
I don't know.

680
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:17,600
Stop!

681
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,880
Stop. Stop!

682
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,460
I'll tell you!

683
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,890
I'll tell you!

684
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:21,790
I'll tell you.

685
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,270
It's-it's on a freighter

686
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,660
leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

687
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,810
How is it concealed?!

688
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,590
In a container carrying medical supplies.

689
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,530
What's the container number?

690
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,320
I don't know.

691
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,190
What's the number?!

692
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:31,720
I don't know!

693
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,220
I-I'd tell you, I swear.

694
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,670
Mr. Bauer!

695
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,000
I don't know.

696
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,380
Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack Bauer on line three.

697
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,750
Jack, what's going on?

698
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,720
We've been trying to reach you.

699
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,440
Bill, hold on.

700
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,750
I'm going to put you on speakerphone.

701
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,230
Bill, I'm standing here with the president.

702
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,880
The nerve gas is at Long Beach Harbor

703
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,420
in a container full of medical supplies

704
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,570
on a freighter bound for Central Asia.

705
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,890
It's set to depart at 2:30 p.m.

706
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,810
How solid is the intel, Jack?

707
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,200
It came directly from Cummings.

708
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,360
Mr. President, we've been trying to reach you

709
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,530
about an order we received changing our jurisdiction.

710
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,920
Disregard the order.

711
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,820
Then you want CTU to maintain operational control of the retrieval?

712
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,350
Yes. Absolutely.

713
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,520
I'm alerting CBP.

714
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,840
Get hazmat teams in there and set up a perimeter.

715
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,900
Have medical teams standing by

716
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,210
in case the gas is released.

717
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:35,720
Got it.

718
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,670
Good work, Jack.

719
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,680
Are you heading back to CTU?

720
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,770
I don't know yet.

721
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,420
Jack, we'll let you know when we have

722
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,000
more information on the container.

723
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,050
Copy that.

724
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,560
Mr. President,

725
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,610
Agent Pierce and I are prepared

726
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,980
to hand ourselves over to the authorities now.

727
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,100
Aaron.

728
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,080
Yes, Mr. President?

729
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,290
Take back your shield

730
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,480
and get Walt Cummings out of my sight.

731
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,290
Yes, sir.

732
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,120
He told me it was too late, and I believed him.

733
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,550
You need to understand, I trusted Walt Cummings...

734
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,060
but he lied to me.

735
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,100
I was coerced.

736
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,760
There is, uh, one more thing that we need to discuss.

737
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,400
What is that, sir?

738
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,110
You.

739
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,690
The fact that you're alive

740
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,510
presents problems for both of us.

741
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,470
Yes, Mr. President.

742
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,880
I accomplished what I set out to do

743
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,680
which was to identify and locate David Palmer's killer.

744
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,410
I would like to stay on until

745
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,610
the nerve gas is retrieved.

746
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,770
After that, I give you my word

747
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,800
I will simply disappear again.

748
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,780
All right.

749
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,560
I think that would be best

750
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,960
for the good of the country.

751
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,680
Yes, sir.

752
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,100
Thank you, Mr. Bauer.

753
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,600
Thank you, Mr. President.

754
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,190
Excuse me.

755
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,540
I'll see you soon.

756
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,100
Wait. Kevin. Hold up

757
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,220
What's happening?

758
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,850
- Martha. - Charles...

759
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,820
Come on. Get out of the car.

760
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,350
Be careful.

761
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,810
What?

762
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,550
You were right.

763
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,320
There was a conspiracy.

764
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,660
David was trying to

765
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,860
warn you and warn me.

766
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,710
I should have listened to you.

767
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,150
I-I...

768
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,260
Y-you... you believe me now?

769
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,360
It was Walt Cummings.

770
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:09,930
He lied to me.

771
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,020
He convinced me that you were out of control.

772
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,890
Walt?!

773
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,150
Sending you back to the... the clinic in Vermont was his idea.

774
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,720
And you went along with it.

775
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,330
I'm sorry, Martha.

776
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,000
Sending me away without a word...

777
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,840
like I was... some nuisance to be gotten rid of.

778
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,660
Excuse me, Mr. President,

779
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,030
but you wanted to know when a link with CTU

780
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,210
was established.

781
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, um... thank you, Wendy.

782
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,110
See that the First Lady's bags

783
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,350
get back to her room.

784
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,510
Of course.

785
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,000
I've got to go.

786
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,370
Chloe, do we have confirmation on the intel Jack gave us?

787
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,080
There's only one ship

788
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,340
scheduled to leave the port

789
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,780
of Long Beach at 2:30.

790
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,460
It's a freighter heading for Central Asia,

791
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,810
leaving from Pier F.

792
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,810
We don't have CTU teams in the vicinity,

793
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,080
but we've got a Customs and Border Protection

794
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,520
task force on site under our directive.

795
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,380
All right, make sure that CBP understands

796
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,150
the nerve gas is housed in 20 canisters

797
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,700
of gray metal that are unmarked.

798
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,410
They're going out in a shipment of medical supplies.

799
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,420
Yeah, yeah, they know all that already.

800
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:38,870
But there's going to be

801
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,870
about a thousand cargo containers on that ship

802
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,560
and we don't know which one the nerve gas is in.

803
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,380
It's container 539146,

804
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,970
box seven.

805
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,820
I was able to hack into the ship's manifest.

806
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,750
It's the only container stocking medical supplies.

807
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,420
That's great.

808
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,380
Make sure all the strike force units have that.

809
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,590
Right.

810
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,210
Lynn, the White House is requesting

811
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,430
a live feed from the assault.

812
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,530
We'll have Chloe patch them in once the TAC teams

813
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,980
reach the staging area.

814
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,820
All right, got it. Yeah.

815
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:04,650
That's him.

816
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,930
His name is Ivan Erwich.

817
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:08,390
He's a chemical engineer

818
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,500
trained at the University of St. Petersburg.

819
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,540
Joined his country's separatist movement six years ago.

820
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,560
Do we have any clearer images any file photos?

821
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,660
No, which is why we need you to I.D. him

822
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,560
when the strike force has a visual.

823
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,050
Okay, just make sure that CPB knows

824
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,530
that we need to take Erwich alive.

825
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,120
They know. Stand by.

826
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,700
What's the situation?

827
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,760
The strike team is in place, Mr. President.

828
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,330
We're just waiting for the video feed to come up.

829
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,650
Feed's up.

830
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,630
CTU, we've located the target container.

831
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,230
No hostiles present.

832
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,710
You have the green light, Agent Finn.

833
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,230
Remember,

834
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,880
do not discharge your weapons

835
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,320
unless absolutely necessary.

836
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,950
If a bullet breaches one of those canisters,

837
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,570
we'll have a massive casualty situation.

838
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,550
Copy that.

839
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:16,820
Masks on.

840
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,520
Go!

841
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,660
Don't move!

842
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,640
Put your hands in the air now!

843
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,000
He's dead.

844
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,540
Open 'em up.

845
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,430
Open 'em up.

846
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,500
Let's go! Open 'em all up.

847
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,290
This one.

848
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,220
Empty. Next.

849
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,280
Moving on, moving on.

850
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,460
Come on, get it open.

851
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,000
Empty. Next. Come on, move it.

852
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,480
Open it open it.Next.Open it

853
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,590
come on, come on.

854
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,370
What do we got?

855
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,880
What do we got?!

856
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,480
Nothing?!

857
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,780
There are no gas canisters here, CTU.

858
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,710
Repeat, the nerve gas is not here.

859
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,880
Get Walt Cummings in here now!

860
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,510
Yes, sir.

861
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,300
Damn it!

862
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,680
The nerve gas isn't there.

863
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,470
It has to be.

864
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,130
Where are the canisters?!

865
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:24,750
I don't know.

866
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,420
I-I've told you everything.

867
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,080
They have to be there.

868
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,120
- Oh, God... - What is it?

869
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,760
That's Schaeffer, the man we had inside.

870
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,830
They must've found out

871
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,460
we reprogrammed the detonators.

872
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,020
It's his cell phone, sir.

873
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,850
Who's calling you?

874
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,890
That's Schaeffer's number.

875
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,070
Bill?

876
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,880
I want you to monitor and record this call.

877
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:16,910
We're on it.

878
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,050
Answer it now.

879
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,310
Yes?

880
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,080
We know you've altered the arming codes, Mr. Cummings.

881
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,070
Who is this?

882
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,410
I think you know my name...

883
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,260
as I now know yours.

884
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,350
Your man Schaeffer confessed everything.

885
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Is President Logan with you?

886
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,210
The President had nothing to do with this...

887
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,000
nor did anyone else in the government.

888
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,520
I was acting alone.

889
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,630
Do you really expect me to believe that?

890
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,990
It's the truth.

891
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,980
Erwich, listen.

892
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,370
We can negotiate something.

893
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,340
I don't negotiate with my enemies.

894
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,460
I eliminate them.

895
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:57,020
Your country is about to pay a very steep price.
