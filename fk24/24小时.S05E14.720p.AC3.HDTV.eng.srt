1
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,310
Have you got it yet?

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,080
Told you I'd call you as soon as I have everything.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,940
I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette.

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,390
And if you could've gotten

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,460
the detailed specs of a facility this secure

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,400
from someone else, you would've.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,640
CTU is no longer an obstacle.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,290
This facility has been contaminated with Sentox VX-1 nerve gas.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,580
Everybody

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,380
leave the situation room. Move! Now!

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,910
Seal it.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,680
Lynn, it's Jack.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,980
We found a computer interrupt in the AC control unit.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,830
Now if we can shut that down in the next few minutes, we can stop the gas

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,290
from permeating the safe zones.

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,210
The problem is you're the only person close enough to get to it.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,960
Lynn, the truth is if I could get there,

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,600
I would do this myself, but I'm not close enough.

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,060
And I'm going to have to ask you to do it without any protection.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,980
He did it.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
CTU is protecting this city.

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,840
Are you saying they're no longer capable of doing that?

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,110
I'm saying they've been seriously compromised here.

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,780
We've got terrorists with nerve gas canisters out there.

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,880
Who is going to stop them?

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,800
Mr. President, I suggest an emergency restructuring.

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,610
CTU is no longer an operational entity.

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
It's a building with workers who will report to us.

29
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,890
I can see no other option right now

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,260
but to impose marshal law on the city of Los Angeles.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,230
What I will not do

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,900
is stand by and watch Hal Gardner use you

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,760
to promote his own agenda.

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,610
You killed my wife Michelle Dessler this morning.

35
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,960
She was my life.

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,340
And you took her.

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,810
My God, he's got a gun.

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,760
You can't do this.

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,510
We have to get him talking.

40
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,740
He's our only lead to Bierko and the Sentox gas canisters.

41
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,980
You've had your chance.

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,110
He's mine now.

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,040
Tony!

44
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,540
The following takes place between 8Pm and 9Pm.

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,210
Jack, I am so sorry.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,410
Security find Henderson yet? No, he got

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,410
out of the building before the lockdown.

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,940
An external cam got a shot of him as he was leaving.

49
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,810
And the car that he was using was found a block away.

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,910
But I think that we might've got what we needed from him.

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,380
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,480
Chloe was able to decrypt a file from his computer.

53
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,980
She got a name of someone connected to Bierko.

54
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,580
Who's Collette Stenger?

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,980
She's an international intelligence broker.

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,980
State secrets, intellectual property.

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,080
What's her connection to Bierko?

58
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,060
Interpol claims that she and Bierko

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,500
met at least twice over the last eight months.

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,240
And we think she helped broker the deal.

61
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,440
Is she still in Los Angeles?

62
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,160
She gave a name of a hotel to customs.

63
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,760
But nothing's to say that she's actually there.

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,890
Curtis is prepping a tactical team to try to bring her in.

65
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,090
Okay. Good work.

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,580
Manning.

67
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,580
Curtis, it's Jack.

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,310
When is the tac team leaving?

69
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,910
- Right now. - I'm going with you.

70
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,940
All right.

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,680
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

72
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,040
member of the press corps...

73
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,990
Just so you're aware, there will be no Q&A

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,900
following the president's statement.

75
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,190
But you can submit questions to my office...

76
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,490
You're having second thoughts?

77
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,590
Putting soldiers on the streets of L.A.,

78
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,060
this will not be a popular announcement.

79
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,940
Maybe not.

80
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,110
But it's the right move.

81
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,210
Hal, would you excuse us, please?

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,710
Mrs. Logan, the president's about to go on the air.

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,410
I'll be brief.

84
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,210
I would like a moment alone with my husband.

85
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,080
I've made up my mind, Martha.

86
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm not debating this anymore.

87
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
Just listen, listen please.

88
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,460
Mike Novick spoke to someone at CTU.

89
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,240
They think they have a lead on this man Bierko.

90
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,010
They think they may find him before he launches another attack.

91
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,000
CTU was just hit. 40% of their people are either dead or unable to work.

92
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,530
To think that they would be able

93
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,160
to stop this attack, that's just wishful thinking.

94
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,210
Maybe not.

95
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,380
Bringing the military in is the best way to maintain order.

96
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,080
The Vice President's right about that.

97
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,260
Of course he is.

98
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,430
What's that mean?

99
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,860
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

100
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,500
that he proposed this whole thing to set you up for a fall?

101
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,940
So he gets the nomination next year.

102
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,250
That's insane.

103
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,850
Hal's only motivation is what's best for the country.

104
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,400
There's going to be fallout.

105
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,700
Hal knows it.

106
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,080
And you know it.

107
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,280
Mr.President.

108
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,540
I have to go.

109
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,110
Charles...

110
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,090
Ladies and gentlemen,

111
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,600
the President of the United States.

112
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,560
As you all know, America has been hit today

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,830
by a series of terrorist strikes,

114
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,560
beginning with the assassination of former President David Palmer

115
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,510
and the murder of innocent Americans at Ontario Airport,

116
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,930
followed by the attempted assassination of Russian President Yuri Suvarov.

117
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,850
These events are being orchestrated

118
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,760
by terrorists operating within our borders.

119
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,280
Our most recent intelligence suggests

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,460
that they will strike again and soon.

121
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,530
I can and will do my sworn duty

122
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,460
to ensure the safety of the American people.

123
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,620
Therefore I am issuing an executive order

124
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,220
imposing a curfew on all civilians

125
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,830
in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

126
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,940
This curfew will be effective immediately

127
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,180
and will be enforced by the military.

128
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,910
As disruptive and distasteful as I know this is for many of you,

129
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,410
I would ask that you remember that we are at war.

130
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,210
Bracing ourselves against future attacks...

131
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,810
D.O.D. is asking for a list of our casualties.

132
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,270
I don't want any names released

133
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,330
until the next of kin have been notified.

134
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,040
Let me know when that happens.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,340
This place is a sinking ship.

136
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,450
We should be taking over now

137
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,840
not going through the charade of an assessment.

138
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,370
Until we're ready to transition

139
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,900
we need everyone here functioning.

140
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,100
Once the remaining canisters of nerve gas have been found

141
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,160
and the terrorists captured,

142
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,980
then we'll assume full control.

143
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,980
Karen.

144
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,880
Hello, Bill.

145
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,280
Bill Buchanan, Miles Papazian from my office.

146
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,380
I appreciate your coming, but that wasn't necessary.

147
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,080
We just need to replace some key personnel.

148
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,880
We're all sorry about the loss of lives here,

149
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,180
but the White House feels you may need more than that.

150
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,440
They want an assessment

151
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,700
of how Homeland may best assist CTU.

152
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
I'll brief you in my office.

153
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,290
Fine.

154
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,440
Miles, familiarize yourself with the networks

155
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,730
and then start the survey.

156
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,210
Let's go.

157
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,210
Upstairs.

158
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,080
Chloe O'Brian?

159
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,980
Who are you?

160
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,980
Homeland Security.

161
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,980
I asked your name, not who you work for.

162
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,980
I need a vacant station set up.

163
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,180
I'm kind of busy right now.

164
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,060
I'm seeing Edgar Stiles listed on my report as a casualty.

165
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,190
Is that right?

166
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,060
Yeah.

167
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,880
Then his station should be available.I'll set up over there.

168
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,290
I'll be reinstalling operating protocols for everyone in your group,

169
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,590
so I'll need your keycard.

170
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,590
No.

171
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,590
I'm sorry?

172
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,990
You can't have my keycard.

173
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,190
We're here with a priority admin directive.

174
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,490
You can confirm that with your supervisor on your own time.

175
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,280
We're live in Los Angeles, where just a few minutes ago,

176
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,640
Army units stationed in L.A. County

177
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,990
began moving in force across city limits.

178
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,400
This is the first time a military presence of this scale

179
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,960
has been activated in a major metropolitan area.

180
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,510
While White House officials have stopped short

181
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,050
of officially declaring full-scale martial law...

182
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,890
Where are you going?

183
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,690
I just need some fresh air.

184
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,660
These mobile Army divisions were activated

185
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:42,720
in which he declared an enforced curfew.

186
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,750
shortly after the President's press conference

187
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,990
I do not trust him.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,260
Ma'am?

189
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,150
The Vice President.

190
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,040
This is Aaron Pierce.

191
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,310
Aaron,

192
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,330
it's Wayne Palmer.

193
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,060
Sir, I am so sorry about President Palmer,

194
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,880
more sorry than I can describe.

195
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,140
Aaron, I know how close you were to my brother.

196
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,240
You must have known he felt the same way about you.

197
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,080
Thank you for saying that.

198
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,310
Actually, Aaron, he's the reason I'm calling.

199
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,500
There's something from my brother I need to give you personally.

200
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,340
I should be there within the hour.

201
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,510
You're coming here?

202
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,960
Yeah, I know it sounds impulsive, Aaron.

203
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,330
Yeah, I know it sounds impulsive, Aaron.

204
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,180
There's a curfew in effect, sir.

205
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,260
I know, I know. I left before it was declared.

206
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,180
If I may say so, this is an odd request.

207
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,130
Aaron, my brother trusted you with his life.

208
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,480
I am asking you to trust me.

209
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
All right.

210
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,380
I'd also appreciate it if you would keep this between us.

211
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,030
I'm hoping there's somewhere we can meet discreetly.

212
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,380
I'll find a place.

213
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,380
Thank you, Aaron.

214
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,080
I'll call you when I'm close.

215
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,860
The effects of this action will no doubt

216
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,140
ripple across the country, as other cities begin to take note.

217
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,980
So while legislators debate

218
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,780
the legality of President Logan's action,

219
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,080
martial law is already a fact...

220
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,110
Mike, turn it off.

221
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,910
"Debate the legality of President Logan's action."

222
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,500
Did you hear that? They're talking about this like it's an illegal action.

223
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,210
Don't worry, Mr. President.

224
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,010
I'm in control of the situation.

225
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,740
Our legal people are working on it right now.

226
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,400
Do we have anything more from CTU?

227
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,730
They're still following up on this Bierko lead.

228
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,260
As soon as they have something to report,we'll be the first to hear.

229
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,680
Give me details of the current threat assessment.

230
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,970
There's a high probability that Bierko is planning an attack

231
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,260
on a much larger scale than anything we've seen today.

232
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,180
That's why he targeted CTU.

233
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,210
to cripple our ability to stop him.

234
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,740
And the question is: Was he successful?

235
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,780
When you look at the numbers,

236
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,700
you were harder hit than you thought, Bill.

237
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,080
We're still functioning.

238
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,280
Maybe not at a 100%,

239
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,180
but when you install the people I've asked for...

240
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,140
we'll be back to fighting strength.

241
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,840
Have you made any progress finding Bierko?

242
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,340
We've identified a woman we believe might lead us to him.

243
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,140
Collette Stenger.

244
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,510
We've just sent a tac team to bring her in.

245
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,010
Good.

246
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,660
I enjoy watching you get dressed

247
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,140
almost as much as I enjoy watching you get undressed.

248
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,060
You should get dressed yourself and send the bags down.

249
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,510
This deal you're working on,

250
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,610
I hope you're getting a lot of money for it.

251
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,080
I never talk about my business, you know that.

252
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,480
I know...

253
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,780
but Maria called about this villa in Positano.

254
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,180
She said when you see it, you'll love it.

255
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,400
We'll call her later.

256
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll see you at the airport, okay? In 45 minutes.

257
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,480
I'll be there.

258
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,430
Yes.

259
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,960
I'm on my way.

260
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,980
And you have everything I asked for?

261
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,890
Of course.

262
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,490
Good.

263
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,100
Do you have the money?

264
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,440
As soon as I verify the merchandise

265
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,990
I'll have it transferred to your account.

266
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,190
I'll be there soon.

267
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,990
Does she have the schematics and the access codes?

268
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,190
Yes.

269
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,590
Everything we need.

270
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,290
The Distribution Center is a difficult target.

271
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,380
It would be much easier to hit a less secure location.

272
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,580
No, Mikhail,

273
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,580
this is the place.

274
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Release the Sentox here...

275
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,180
and 200,000 people die.

276
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,080
And we need a second satellite repositioned as soon as possible.

277
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
- Good. - Thank you.

278
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,890
I saw a request for proficiency evaluations

279
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,100
for all CTU personnel on my secondary screen.

280
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,030
That's a formality. The fact is, we don't have time for evaluations right now.

281
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,990
Then why was it put in the pipeline?

282
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,360
Like I said, it's a formality.

283
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,090
You're here to shut this place down, aren't you?

284
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,480
And the evaluations will be filled in later as a matter of protocol.

285
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,680
I told you before, the White House...

286
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,780
I know what you told me before.

287
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,780
Now tell me the truth.

288
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,130
The truth is, CTU is being absorbed by Homeland.

289
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,560
Which means, from now on, every operational decision needs to go through me.

290
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,880
Bill, what did you expect?

291
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,300
You've been infiltrated.

292
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,900
56 of your peoplehave been killed.The others are demoralized...

293
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,500
They're not demoralized,they're angry!

294
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,600
They want to fight back.

295
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,900
They're willing to lay down their lives.Some already have...

296
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,800
It's done, Bill.

297
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,260
The decision's been made.

298
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,430
And I know neither one of us wants

299
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,600
this transition to interfere with ongoing protocol,

300
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,300
so let's just keep it between us.

301
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
At least until this crisis plays out.

302
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,100
Bill?

303
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,430
Homeland is being overly aggressive with their survey.

304
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,210
What is going on?

305
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,210
Nothing.

306
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,590
It's just a formality.They'll be gone as soon as they finish their evaluation.

307
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,210
Where are we on the military mobilization?

308
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,090
Martial law is in effect in nine of the 15 L.A.districts.

309
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,980
I'm setting up checkpoints for the rest of the county now.

310
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,380
I hope the president's doing the right thing.

311
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,440
Alpha Team,

312
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,790
we're approaching Collette Stenger's apartment

313
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,450
and we're ready to move.Are you in position?

314
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,560
Affirmative. We've got the lobby covered.

315
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,250
Copy.

316
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,960
I think she went for the roof. Cover the stairs.

317
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,130
Let's go.

318
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,250
We're going up top.

319
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,750
Drop the gun!

320
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,050
Stand down or he dies!

321
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,650
I said stand down!

322
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,960
Our people are all around you.

323
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
They will drop you before you could pull that trigger.

324
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,790
Put the gun down!

325
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,660
What do you mean your "people?" Who are you?

326
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,160
Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.

327
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,760
Show me identification.

328
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,160
I'm with the German Federal Intelligence Service.

329
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,160
My name's Theo Stoller.

330
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,660
What are you doing in this country?

331
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,030
I'm here on special assignment...

332
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,060
by agreement between our governments.

333
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,960
Now you can get the hell out of here before you destroy my cover.

334
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,370
That's not going to happen.

335
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,230
O'Brian.

336
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:22,970
Chloe, it's Jack.

337
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,370
I want you to check on a foreign agent on the SA list.

338
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,470
"Theo Stoller."

339
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,870
Okay.

340
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,670
Got it: "Theo Stoller,

341
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,170
height, 5'll", brown hair, brown eyes."

342
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,030
He's a German operative,but trained in England at MI-6.

343
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,260
There's even contact information: cell phone...

344
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,290
That's all right, Chloe.That's enough, thanks.

345
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,190
I told you, you have to get out of here now.

346
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,090
We can't do that.

347
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,490
You were with Collette Stenger.

348
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,690
We need her to help us find Vladimir Bierko.

349
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,690
I don't know him.

350
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,540
Bierko's responsible for the terrorist attacks

351
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,860
that took place in the city earlier today.

352
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,380
He's preparing to mount another one as we speak.

353
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,180
Collette Stenger is the only way we can find him.

354
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,480
Where is she?

355
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,680
I can't help you.

356
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Why not?

357
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,580
Giving you Collette jeopardizes my operation.

358
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,980
What operation?

359
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,940
I've been undercover for the last six months

360
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,560
gathering intel on Collette's clientele.

361
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,190
We've identified cells in three countries,

362
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,090
but she's connected to a dozen more.

363
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,990
She's too valuable to give up.

364
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,390
If we don't find Bierko

365
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,490
hundreds of thousands of innocent people will die here today.

366
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,190
That is more important than your preemptive operation.

367
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,890
It's not a question of importance,

368
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,430
it's a question of different agendas.

369
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,800
Your job is to save American lives.

370
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,790
Mine to save German lives.

371
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,060
You're asking me to betray my duty to my country.

372
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,680
Ask yourself what you would do in my position.

373
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,880
You better start asking yourself what you would do in mine.

374
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,190
Now, let's go.

375
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,100
I'm here by permission of your government,you can't touch me.

376
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,180
Right.We'll see about that.

377
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,620
Well, make sure that your superior

378
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,480
understands that if this attack happens,

379
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,460
my government will hold your country accountable.

380
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,030
Jack, it's Buchanan.Audrey will be joining us momentarily.

381
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,390
You're also on the line with Karen Hayes from Homeland Security.

382
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,490
She's been providing support to CTU

383
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,390
and she's also been in contact with the White House.

384
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,990
Did President Logan get in touch with the German Chancellor?

385
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,590
He's tried the chancellor's unreachable for another hour.

386
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,090
We don't have another hour.

387
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,190
They're stalling, there's nothing we can do about that.

388
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,990
Jack, this is Audrey.I was just speaking with German Intelligence.

389
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,830
They're refusing to order their agent to cooperate with us.

390
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,290
Maybe you can get a deal with him.

391
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,860
Okay, I'll talk to Stoller again.

392
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,200
Good. Call me if you get him to change his mind.

393
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,400
Yeah.

394
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,280
Curtis?

395
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,960
Let me have a moment with him alone.

396
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,910
Jack, what are you doing?

397
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,140
It's all right.

398
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,210
All right.

399
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,260
Your intelligence service denied our request for cooperation.

400
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,630
So has your government.

401
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,910
I'm not surprised.

402
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,530
Collette Stenger is a golden goose.

403
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,110
There's no upside in giving her up.

404
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,310
Maybe I could provide you with one.

405
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,040
Meaning?

406
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,340
I will give you something that is more valuable than Collette Stenger.

407
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,180
It's hard to know what that might be.

408
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,960
Our roster of all known terror suspects

409
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,330
working around the world, our WET list.

410
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,830
As allies, we've requested this WET list many times before.

411
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,610
But the NSA has always said,giving us the list would jeopardize their operations.

412
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,640
It will.

413
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,030
I don't work for the NSA, I don't work for CTU.

414
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,710
This is personal.And right now, you're not giving me another choice.

415
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,680
All right.

416
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,210
I'll give you Collette

417
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,010
in exchange for the WET list.

418
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,240
Good.

419
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,140
Let's see what we can do.

420
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,880
Agent Bauer.

421
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,740
I'm aware of several names that should be on that list.

422
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,380
Don't try and pass me a fake.

423
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,480
O'Brian.

424
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,610
Chloe, it's Jack.

425
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,960
Do we still have a back door into NSA's secured mainframe?

426
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,360
I can't really talk right now, Jack.

427
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,830
Okay, fine. Then, listen.

428
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,200
I need you to log on to their server

429
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,560
download the WET list, and send it to my PDA immediately.

430
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,510
Why?

431
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,890
The WET list is what we're gonna have to pay to get Collette Stenger.

432
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,230
Jack, that list is as top secret as it gets.

433
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,280
Homeland Security sent a team over here.

434
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,480
You're gonna have to clear it with them.

435
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,710
We can't afford to take the chance of them saying no.

436
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,840
I'm not saying I won't do it without their approval.

437
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm saying I can't.

438
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,780
They took my keycard.

439
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,510
I can't get into the NSA mainframe without it.

440
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,480
Just do what you have to.It's our only way to get Bierko.

441
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,140
Fine. I'll call you back.

442
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,310
Excuse me, Miles.

443
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,410
My God!

444
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,040
What is the matter with you?

445
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,140
Sorry.

446
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,410
What's wrong with you?

447
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,430
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

448
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,480
Yeah?

449
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,540
Jack, I got on the NSA server.

450
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Did you get the file?

451
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,340
Not yet. They put an extra layer of authentication in place.

452
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,980
Can you get around it?

453
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,640
Hold on.

454
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,680
Okay, I got it.

455
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,410
I hope you know what you're doing.

456
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,410
I'm uploading it now.

457
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,890
Thanks.

458
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,110
I got it.

459
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,460
Well, that appears legitimate.

460
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,610
It is.

461
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,840
Give me back the memory card.

462
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,780
You can't upload the WET list to your people

463
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,360
until I have Collette Stenger in custody.

464
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,780
Well, fair enough.

465
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,910
We have to go now.

466
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,930
I'm supposed to meet her at the Van Nuys airport in less than 20 minutes.

467
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,530
What kind of a car is she driving?

468
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,980
I don't know.I'm supposed to park in car Lot C and wait for her.

469
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,380
She'll probably recon the area before she makes contact.

470
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,940
She's, uh, cautious by habit.

471
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,190
Curtis, we're on the move  Van Nuys Airport.

472
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,690
We'll give you the details when we're on the way.

473
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,550
When you receive the funds,

474
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,500
transfer them immediately into the Caymans account.

475
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,310
In Euros.

476
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,110
My bank is ready to accept the transfer.

477
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,340
The file is encrypted.

478
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,160
What is the decryption key?

479
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,630
Transfer the funds.

480
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,610
It's been sent.

481
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,590
Thank you.E-mail me confirmation of the transfer.

482
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,730
The decryption key is Charlie Alpha Three Nine Alpha.

483
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,040
It worked. This is what you wanted.

484
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,180
Of course it is.

485
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,340
Until next time, gentlemen.

486
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,340
Are the men ready?

487
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,340
Yes.

488
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,230
Torch this place.We're moving out.

489
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,980
Governor, I'm not trying to co-opt your authority,

490
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,780
but we are in the middle of a crisis here.

491
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,880
Now, you can either transmit my orders word for word to the National Guard

492
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,180
or I can federalize them,and give them my orders directly

493
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,790
your choice.

494
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,110
Excellent.

495
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,530
Thank you, Governor.I look forward to your croperation.

496
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,750
Sir, we have a situation at one of the roadblocks

497
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,910
that the region three commander needs your call on.

498
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,640
Tell me.

499
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,640
Wayne Palmer is insisting he be let through one of our roadblocks.

500
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,240
He claims he still has his clearance and that he's on official business.

501
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,550
And where exactly is that?

502
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,080
He was stopped trying to get on the access road coming towards the retreat.

503
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,680
He's on his way here? To do what?

504
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,480
He wouldn't give the officer in charge of the roadblock any information.

505
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,530
What should I tell the roadblock, sir?

506
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,400
Captain, all I'm asking you to do is call and confirm

507
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,100
I have a grade two clearance, that's it.

508
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,460
Sir, regardless of your clearance authorization to let you through

509
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,100
must come down through the appropriate chain of command.

510
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,910
And just who would that be, huh, Captain?

511
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,040
Who's in charge of the military's role in this?

512
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,810
Riggs.

513
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,240
Understood.

514
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,010
Thank you, sir.

515
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,540
You can go on through now, sir.

516
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,940
Let him through.

517
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,410
Thank you, Captain.

518
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,840
All teams are in position, Jack.

519
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,210
No one moves in until I confirm that it's her.

520
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,140
Copy that.

521
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,780
Collette won't show herself if she senses anything's wrong.

522
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,210
Make sure he stays hidden.

523
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,530
Don't worry. He will.

524
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,740
What will happen to her?

525
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,780
To Collette.

526
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,660
I don't know yet. Why?

527
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,980
Uh, just curious.

528
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,410
You've been in my situation?

529
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,180
I've been undercover for long stretches of time, yeah.

530
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,280
And been involved with a woman during that time?

531
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,250
There's no question we are doing what has to be done for our countries,

532
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,290
but sometimes it's harder than others.

533
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,680
Chloe, could you join us in the Situation Room, please?

534
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,980
Sure.

535
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,780
What's going on?

536
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,120
Why don't you tell us, Ms. O'Brian?

537
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,810
I don't know.

538
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,380
We've got you hacking into a top secret NSA archive.

539
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

540
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,040
I pulled a mirrored archive of your web traffic.

541
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,840
Whatever you took from NSA was uploaded to Jack Bauer's remote node.

542
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,690
Ms. O'Brian, tell us exactly what document you passed to Jack Bauer.

543
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,210
Chloe,

544
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,740
this is going to get much worse if you force me to have NSA run a back trace.

545
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,840
What is it?

546
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,310
Jack needed the WET List.

547
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,210
What?!

548
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,280
Why on earth would you give him that?

549
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,580
Theo Stoller wouldn't lead us to Collette Stenger without it.

550
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,490
Chloe, giving that list to another intelligence agency could be disastrous.

551
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,610
Years of work could be rendered useless our own agents could be exposed.

552
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,080
Jack needed it, okay?

553
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,190
No! No, it's not okay.

554
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,290
And you expected us to give your agents a chance?

555
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,690
Get me Bauer.

556
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,180
Put it on speaker phone, or I'm getting out of this car.

557
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Fine.

558
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,440
This is Bauer.

559
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,810
Jack, it's Bill.

560
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,040
Karen Hayes is here, as well.

561
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,100
If you're with Theo Stoller,

562
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,680
get some place you can talk privately.

563
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,700
I can't. We're in the middle of an operation.

564
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,340
If I move I'll jeopardize our position.

565
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,580
Then you'll have to have this conversation in front of him.

566
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,240
Have you given him the WET List yet?

567
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,810
Yes.

568
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,910
Has he given it to German Intelligence?

569
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,210
No.

570
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,910
Then get it back. Now.

571
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,510
I can't.

572
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,610
If I do that, Stoller won't cooperate.

573
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,690
And then we'll lose Collette Stenger.

574
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,480
Bill, will you explain this to her?

575
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
It's not his decision.

576
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Retrieve the WET list now

577
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
or I will order Agent Manning and his team to do it.

578
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,680
Right now, Collette Stenger is our only connection to Bierko.

579
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,450
If you blow this operation, you will be responsible

580
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,480
for every life lost in his next attack.

581
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
I don't like to be threatened, Mr. Bauer.

582
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,180
Ms. Hayes, that's not a threat, that's a fact.

583
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,230
German Intelligence will move preemptively on people

584
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,280
that we have been watching for years.

585
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,180
Our ability to prevent terrorist attacks will be severely threatened.

586
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,890
Then that's a risk we'll have to take.

587
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,610
Right now, we have to deal with this situation.

588
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,230
It's not your call.

589
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,530
It's not mine, either.

590
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,810
We need authorization from the President.

591
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,560
Then get it.

592
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Jack, one of our forward teams I.D.'d a woman fitting Stenger's description

593
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,580
driving a red Lexus making its second circuit around the lot.

594
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,240
This could be her.

595
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,480
We have a possible suspect approaching.

596
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,660
Ms. Hayes, are you telling me that I have to abort this operation?

597
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,690
Yes or no?

598
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,240
Ms. Hayes, this is your call.

599
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,540
You don't know for certain that this woman will lead us to Bierko.

600
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,980
No, not for certain.But, right now, she's our only lead.

601
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,710
Are you willing to take this chance?

602
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,510
You've left me no choice.Proceed.

603
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,100
But you have severely compromised this situation

604
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,040
and I promise you there will be repercussions.

605
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,880
Fine.

606
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,810
Are we all right?

607
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,140
We're fine.

608
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,640
Red Lexus turning the corner.A hundred yards away and approaching.

609
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,330
No one move until I give a go.

610
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,810
The red Lexus is parked.

611
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,290
Move the center mirror, so that I can see the car.

612
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,190
There.

613
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,210
Now get her out of the car.

614
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,310
I have a positive I.D.

615
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,690
All teams move in.

616
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,230
All teams move, move, move! Let's go!

617
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,010
Put your hands where I can see them!

618
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,310
Theo, get in the car, now.

619
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,380
What are you doing?

620
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,710
Let me see your hands!

621
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,710
Let me go.Now!

622
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,080
Theo, get out of there.

623
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,680
I'm sorry.

624
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,280
Theo, who are you?

625
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,180
Move! Letting him go.He's given us what we want!

626
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,780
Put your hands up!

627
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Turn and face the car!

628
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,280
Put your hands on the roof!

629
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,480
Do it!

630
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,280
Where is Bierko?

631
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,460
We know you're working with Bierko.

632
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,330
Where is he?

633
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,210
Fine.

634
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,010
Take her back to staging.

635
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,030
I want a team searching this car.

636
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,260
Take everything back to the staging area.

637
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,880
Now!

638
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,860
It's Theo.

639
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,380
I'm en route to the hotel.

640
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,760
Tell Heinrich I'm uploading something

641
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,560
he's been wanting for a long time.

642
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,980
Stoller.

643
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,080
Theo, it's Jack.I'm sorry.

644
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,280
I thought we had a deal.

645
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,660
When this is over, I promise you,

646
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
I will help you rebuild your investigation.I give you my word.

647
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,290
I had your word.

648
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,890
Now I know what it worth.

649
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,190
What have you got?

650
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,990
Nothing.

651
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,630
She's covered her tracks.

652
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,560
There's no sign

653
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,460
of what she sold to Bierko.

654
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,890
Come with me.

655
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,480
Collette Stenger,

656
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,380
my name is Jack Bauer.

657
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,880
Who is Theo really?

658
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,380
German Intelligence.

659
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,030
Then he sold me for a price.

660
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,080
German and American Intelligence don't work together often.

661
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,680
Where is Bierko?

662
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,780
The fact is, I actually had feelings for Theo.

663
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,840
I never once suspected.He was very good.

664
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,190
I always thought that there

665
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,790
were some things that you cannot fake.

666
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,640
Bierko.

667
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,210
Tell them to leave.

668
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:45,810
Jack?

669
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,510
It's all right.

670
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,660
Curtis, have your men move back

671
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,280
Just give us a second.

672
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,680
You've heard him.

673
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,080
Theo had a price.What's yours?

674
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,180
I'm not for sale.

675
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,580
Everyone is for sale.

676
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,530
This isn't a game, lady.

677
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,660
We're running out of time.

678
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,990
You better tell me what you want.

679
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,380
All right.

680
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
Full immunity. No holdbacks.

681
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,780
Signed by your president and transmitted to lawyers in Zurich and Tripoli.

682
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,040
But I can't tell you where Bierko is.

683
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,810
Why not?

684
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,010
Because he's already gone.

685
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,560
I met him at a safehouse,

686
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,710
but he was already on his way to carry out the attack.

687
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,710
What were you selling him?

688
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,310
I don't know.

689
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,430
What do you mean, you don't know?

690
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,620
I mean I don't know.

691
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,960
It was a schematic.

692
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,460
What kind of a schematic?

693
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm paid to broker the information,

694
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,690
not dwell on the details.

695
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,190
I make it my firm policy.

696
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,190
You expect me to believe that you acquired information

697
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,490
for a terrorist group and you didn't know the specifics?

698
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
You can believe whatever you want.

699
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,530
The fact is, I got the schematics from a source

700
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,920
and they were digitally encrypted.

701
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,820
That source can tell you what they mean.

702
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,690
Give me immunity and I'll give you my source.

703
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,560
Those are my terms.

704
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,180
You haven't offered us very much.

705
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,910
I'll see what I can do.

706
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,710
Buchanan.

707
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,960
Yeah, it's Jack.

708
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,590
She wants full immunity signed by the president.

709
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,290
She claims that she doesn't know where Bierko is.

710
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,910
That she just brokered a deal for a set of schematics,and then delivered them.

711
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,260
She doesn't know what building they're for,

712
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,110
but she can provide us with the source of the schematics.

713
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,580
She doesn't know what she sold him?

714
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,480
She said it was digitally encrypted.

715
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Do you believe her?

716
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,690
She's an independent contractor.

717
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,060
In her line of work, sometimes

718
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,560
what you don't know will save your life.

719
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,890
Either way,

720
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,790
if she's telling the truth, we don't have a lot of time.

721
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,490
She said Bierko already left to set off his next attack.

722
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,890
Miles, call Mike Novick, let's get this started.

723
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,090
Jack,

724
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,690
this better work.

725
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,190
And for the record, I don't like it.

726
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,260
We've paid a steep price.

727
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,290
There'll be fallout on the WET List.

728
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,190
No, there won't be.The fallout will be from German Intelligence.

729
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,390
I programmed the memory card to self-destruct.

730
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,900
Why didn't you tell us this before?

731
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,860
I told you, I was in the car with Stoller.

732
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,530
Get back to me as soon as this is done, we need to move fast.

733
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
I think it's clear.

734
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,780
CTU was hit,but we're still doing our job.

735
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,810
I believe that's an argument to maintain our autonomy.

736
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,880
Well, I'll withhold judgment on that.

737
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,530
We're giving a free pass to a terrorist collaborator,

738
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,130
and I have yet to see what we're getting from it.

739
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,910
Has the document been received in Tripoli as well?

740
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,310
And it meets with your approval?

741
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,710
So, there's no way that they can fail to live up to the terms?

742
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,460
Merci, Herve. Au revoir.

743
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,310
The safehouse is a manufacturing facility at 12451 Saticoy Boulevard.

744
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,750
As for the data I sold to Bierko,it's something

745
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,010
that I received from a contact at the Department of Defense.

746
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:36,910
What's his name?

747
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,560
Her name.

748
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,480
Audrey Raines.

749
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,330
You are lying to me.

750
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,080
She sold me the information, Mr. Bauer.

751
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,230
Apparently she had a price.

752
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,780
Put her in the car.
