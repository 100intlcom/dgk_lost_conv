1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,250
We have waited patiently

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,330
for you to renounce this unholy pact with our oppressors,

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,130
but we have heard nothing.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,210
This it the cost of that silence.

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,410
If you choose to sign this corrupt document,

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,740
understand that you will also be staining

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,930
it with the blood of the remaining hostages.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,190
If CTU can't pull this off in time

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,370
that's upwards of 60 people, Mike.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,960
Mrs. Logan, if someone altered the recording of your conversation

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,520
with David Palmer, the president needs to know.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,480
Between the summit and the hostage situation,

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,910
he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,350
Until the treaty's signed, I'm not letting this out of my sight.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,230
What did she tell you?

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,800
She said it was a transcript of the call she had with David Palmer.

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,930
I understand President Logan wants us to go into the terminal asap.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,400
Yes, before the treaty is signed.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,900
Curtis, what's your situation?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,450
My men are in place, and we're setting the entry charges.

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,970
We should be able to make our entry on target.

22
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,730
I assume Mr. Bauer's been taken into custody?

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,240
Well, I plan to debrief him here.

24
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,740
Bring him in now.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,930
Diane, what's going on? What's wrong?

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,900
Derek is inside the terminal.

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,750
I see him.

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,400
He's with the other hostages but he's not hurt.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,170
Please don't let anything happen to him.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,350
This is not your fault.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,470
I'm the reason you went along with them.

32
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,550
This is not over.

33
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,050
Fire!

34
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,040
We got a problem. One of the hostages is missing.

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,650
He was working with the terrorists.

36
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,940
Give me a description; I'll take care of it.

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,440
I'll help you now-- let's go.

38
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,010
Buchanan just gave orders to take you into custody.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,190
I watched Beresch give this guy a key card.

40
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,020
Something else is going down here.

41
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,670
We've got to find this guy now.

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,600
The following takes place between 11Am and 12Pm

43
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,050
Sorry we have to bring you in like this, Jack.

44
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,680
It's all right, Mara. I understand.

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,170
A year and a half.

46
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,230
How did you manage to stay invisible for so long?

47
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,020
Apparently I wasn't as invisible as I should have been.

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,200
Tyler.

49
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,340
Mara, it's Curtis. Put Bauer on.

50
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,900
It's Agent Manning.

51
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,390
Yeah?

52
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,470
Jack, you say the suspect was hiding among the hostages?

53
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,480
Yeah, right up until the assault began, somewhere around 10:30.

54
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,090
Then he must have broken for an exit.

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,540
What exit was closest?

56
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,680
Without an alarm? Between gates six and seven.

57
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,190
- Thanks, Jack. - Yeah.

58
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,710
Pull up external video starting at 10:30.

59
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,070
All cameras covering gates six and seven.

60
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,540
We're away.

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,500
Mrs. Logan?

62
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,060
Mrs. Logan?

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,130
Oh, my God.

64
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,590
Help! Someone!

65
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,800
Something's happened to the First Lady. Get a doctor, now.

66
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,110
According to Jack, he should be between gates six and seven,

67
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,290
just outside this view.

68
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,560
I got this feed from ten minutes ago.

69
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,220
Try camera seven.

70
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,860
Camera four.

71
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,920
Tighten up.

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,840
Yellow Tie. Got him. Now let's follow him.

73
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,970
Damn it. What camera covers the adjacent sector?

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,890
14A, but it's a bad angle.

75
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,930
Pull it up, anyway. Match the time codes.

76
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,500
Okay, here he is.

77
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,820
This is two minutes, 25 seconds later.

78
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,010
- What hangar is that? - Hangar Double-B.

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,750
- Has it been searched yet? - No.It was outside the secured perimeter.

80
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,320
All right, I'm going to take a field team, head over there.

81
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,580
Send this info to Comm. Team A with me. Let's go!

82
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,750
Hangar Double-B. Let's go.

83
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,650
CTU. Stiles.

84
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,120
Edgar, Jack told us about a suspect hiding among the hostages.

85
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,600
We just picked up surveillance on him.

86
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,530
He entered Hangar Double-B at roughly 10:57.

87
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,750
Did you check it out yet?

88
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,700
No, we're going in now. I'll need comm.

89
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,430
I'm on it. Chloe, what volume is airport facilities on?

90
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,310
Hennessy Four.

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,850
Team  Two, cover the rear.

92
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Check it out.

93
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,830
Everyone else, search the building, see what you can find.

94
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,280
Craig, it's Curtis. Send a forensics team down here now.

95
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,670
Tell them they'll need a full bio-pack with spectrum analyzers.

96
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,270
Any problems getting the canisters out?

97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,390
No. They were hidden exactly where you said they'd be.

98
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,440
Everything on schedule with our transport?

99
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,620
Customs documents are being finalized at the port.

100
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,910
Good. The Russians will finally understand the consequences

101
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,290
of occupying our homeland when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

102
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,970
When did this happen?

103
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,450
A few minutes ago. I came back in, and I found her on the bed.

104
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,190
What  do you mean "came back in"?

105
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,960
You  mean you left her alone.

106
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,850
What happened, Doctor? Is she all right?

107
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,410
She seems to be now, but I'd have to do some tests to find out why she blacked out.

108
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,920
I didn't black out.

109
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,870
Someone did this to me. Someone attacked me, Charles.

110
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,420
- Shh, shh. Martha... - You have to do something.

111
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
You have to do something. They're trying to get me.

112
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,460
No, no one's trying to get you. We just want you to be well.

113
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,690
Honey, listen. Listen, listen. I had the proof, and now it's gone.

114
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,350
What proof? What are you talking about?

115
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,810
The proof that David Palmer called me to warn me about today.

116
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,710
Are we still on this?

117
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,070
We've never been off of it.

118
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,970
You just wouldn't listen to me.

119
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,670
Sir. Is everything okay?

120
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,600
I think so.

121
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,310
No.  No, damn it, it's not okay!

122
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,200
You people have got to listen to me.

123
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,000
I had a document, from the archive room.

124
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,240
Where was this document?

125
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,260
I am trying to tell you.

126
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,640
It was hidden in my blouse. It's gone. Someone stole it from me.

127
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,770
Martha, you've been under a lot of stress.

128
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,110
We all have. Let... let... No, let Dr. Hill...

129
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,680
Let Dr. Hill examine you and we can figure out how to get you better.

130
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,620
You don't believe me.

131
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,170
You don't believe your own wife.

132
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,900
I have an important phone call from the Secretary of State that I have to get to.

133
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,500
If there's any sudden changes, you get back to me as soon as possible.

134
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,800
Yes, Mr. President.

135
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,820
Charles, don't leave.

136
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,800
Honey, I'll be right down the hall.

137
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,410
No, no, no, honey, honey, don't leave me.

138
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,850
- You need to get some rest. - Please...

139
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,540
Close that door.

140
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,000
What do I do about this, Walt?

141
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,140
This is what she was like before you sent her to Vermont.

142
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,010
Are  you suggesting that I readmit her?

143
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,310
You have to consider the option. For her sake.

144
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,200
She said she'd rather die than go back in there.

145
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,850
Sir, if she's going to persist with these conspiracy theories

146
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,700
it's only a matter of time before she talks to someone who believes her.

147
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,810
Then we really will have a problem.

148
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,760
I wish you were wrong, but I don't think you are.

149
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,700
Do you want me to handle this, sir?

150
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,620
Make the arrangements. But don't let Martha find out.

151
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,120
Let me be the one to tell her.

152
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,230
Yes, sir.

153
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,590
Yeah.

154
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,440
Have you handled the problem there?

155
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,810
Yes. Martha Logan won't be giving us any more trouble.

156
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,540
Good. Erwich has just completed transferring the gas to the semi.

157
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,030
He's on his way to the port.

158
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,080
And the authorities don't know anything's been stolen?

159
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,860
Not yet.

160
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,770
Then the only thing we have left to take care of is Bauer.

161
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,980
- Where is he? - On his way to CTU.

162
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,780
Mm. He's getting too close.

163
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,980
He's already started putting the pieces together.

164
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,860
I know. He needs to be taken out.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,710
- I'm handling it myself. - How?

166
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,950
Once he gets to CTU, your hitter won't be able to get near him.

167
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,410
I've have someone on the inside who can help us.

168
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,260
- Then use him. - Done.

169
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,260
You sure those readings are right?

170
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,980
They're right. 2,000 parts per million.

171
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,710
That can only be military grade.

172
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,980
I'll tell him.

173
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,800
Where are you going? I need you to finish the shell script.

174
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,640
Not now.

175
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,380
Since when do you say "not now"?

176
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,000
According to this, the hangar was leased to some offshore company,

177
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,260
but it's been vacant for at least 18 months.

178
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,870
Sir?

179
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,730
I just heard from Curtis. He was right.

180
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,170
There was nerve gas in hangar Double B.

181
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,580
That's what killed the rats.

182
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,570
There were trace amounts found in the animals' blood.

183
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,520
But the concentrations were definitely mil spec-- weaponized.

184
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,890
So this man in the yellow tie,

185
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,260
the suspect that Bauer's telling us about

186
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,630
that's what he was doing at the airport?

187
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,920
Stealing canisters of nerve gas out of the hangar?

188
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,020
Stealing from whom?

189
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,440
Military destroyed its stockpiles years ago.

190
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,530
Well, maybe this nerve gas wasn't produced by the military.

191
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,170
Edgar, have forensics get a signature off the trace samples.

192
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,080
See if they can figure out who manufactured it.

193
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,540
Chloe, elevate our alert status.

194
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,530
Activate all available personnel and get Curtis back here.

195
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,430
We're gonna need everyone we have.

196
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,570
I wouldn't issue a statement about the First Lady for another couple days.

197
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,900
Let your successes today run front and center on all the networks.

198
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,440
That sounds right.

199
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,040
Dr. Hill, please, come in.

200
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,320
- How's Martha doing? - Well, she's asleep now.

201
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,480
Have you figured out what caused the blackout?

202
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,540
I spoke with her psychiatrist, Dr. Carlstrom,

203
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,370
and none of the medication she's been prescribing

204
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,210
would have caused this kind of collapse.

205
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,840
So we still don't know what it was.

206
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,430
Not yet, no.

207
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,470
Mr. President, I need to speak to you and Walt alone.

208
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,970
Thank you, Doctor. Keep a close eye on her.

209
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,530
- We'll talk soon. - Yes, Mr. President.

210
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,810
What's up, Mike?

211
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,970
I'm afraid the situation at the airport has taken an unexpected turn.

212
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,140
What's the problem? The hostages were saved,

213
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,430
we've captured or killed all the terrorists.

214
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,740
Not all of them.

215
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,950
One of the terrorists was posing as a hostage.

216
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,400
He used the hostage crisis to cover a theft.

217
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,460
A theft? What was stolen?

218
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,900
A cache of chemical weapons.

219
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,230
What kind of chemical weapons?

220
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,780
Nerve gas.

221
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,840
Is it ours?

222
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,100
No, sir. CTU is still trying to source it.

223
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,840
But it was buried in a bunker at the airport.

224
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,890
It seems this man had another crew waiting for him there.

225
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,000
Do we have any idea what the terrorists are planning?

226
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,500
Well, they haven't made any demands or issued any threats, yet.

227
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,050
Well, what are we doing to stop them?

228
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,530
CTU is running an interagency search effort.

229
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,580
They're coordinating ground operations, filtering intelligence.

230
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,420
Has the press found out about this, yet?

231
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,130
No, sir. It's being kept internal.

232
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,480
Whatever retaliation we were bracing for an hour ago is nothing

233
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,230
compared to what these people are capable of doing now.

234
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,130
Sir, I'll assemble the Homeland Security team to discuss evacuation scenarios.

235
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,680
I sent everyone updates on the airport forensics.

236
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,110
What did you want me on next?

237
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,180
Check the task list.

238
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,620
You don't need to ask me every time you need something new to do.

239
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,100
I don't care if you are my boss or

240
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,390
if you regret sleeping with me last night.

241
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,180
No one talks to me like that.

242
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,610
Really? I just did.

243
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,560
Yeah.

244
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,620
Now, what's your problem?

245
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,550
- I don't have a problem. - Then what do you want?

246
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,160
- Nothing. - Edgar.

247
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,600
Look, I'm sorry that my private life hasn't remained private today.

248
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,480
I'm thinking the opposite.

249
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,830
- What do you mean? - You're too private.

250
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,570
We've known each other for years.

251
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,880
And today I find out you're keeping secrets from me?

252
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,850
Haven't you ever taken a psychology class? People keep secrets.

253
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,880
I don't. Not from my friends.

254
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,360
Why didn't you tell me Jack was alive?

255
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,060
Oh, come on. It's called national security.

256
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,520
Yeah, well, what about Spenser?

257
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,560
I didn't even know you two were going out.

258
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,790
Give me a break.

259
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:18,370
Okay, when we find the nerve gas and the alert level drops

260
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,030
we  can have some chamomile tea and I'll tell you all my secrets, okay?

261
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,320
You paged me.

262
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,410
- Has Bauer arrived at CTU? - No, not yet.

263
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,370
When he does, I need you to do something.

264
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,960
We have our hands full searching for the nerve gas.

265
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,320
Bauer is a priority.

266
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,610
I need you to clear an entrance into CTU.

267
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,200
I'm sending it now. Okay.

268
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,320
Miss Raines.

269
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,040
I'll  get back to you. Yes?

270
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,720
I take it you're up to speed on the nerve gas stolen from the airport.

271
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,270
I was just filling in DOD.

272
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,740
Diane Huxley and her son were brought in to be debriefed.

273
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,270
I'd like you to interview her.

274
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,580
Interview her about what?

275
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,050
Any information she has that could help us find the nerve gas.

276
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,030
What could she possibly know about that?

277
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,520
I've reviewed the evidence against Jack Bauer,

278
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,330
and I'm inclined to agree with your assessment

279
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,010
that he was framed for the assassination of David Palmer.

280
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,890
Thank  you.

281
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,700
I also think that whoever framed Jack

282
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,840
is also involved with the theft of this nerve gas.

283
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,920
Which means that Diane Huxley could have had

284
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,970
contact with that person without realizing it.

285
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,690
I'm not a trained interrogator.

286
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,900
But you know Jack Bauer better than anyone else in here.

287
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,700
You have something in common with this woman.

288
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,600
It might help her open up.

289
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,010
I realize it's awkward, but I need you to do it.

290
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,410
Fine.

291
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,070
I'll see what I can get from her.

292
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,480
Thank you.

293
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,540
Where is she?

294
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,270
She and her son just cleared security.

295
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,930
Miss Huxley, I'm Audrey Raines.

296
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,220
- Hi. - Hello.

297
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,430
This is my son, Derek.

298
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,850
Hi.  I'm gonna be asking you a few questions.

299
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,340
And Derek, I want you to be checked out by a doctor

300
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,760
while I speak with your mother.

301
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,290
There's nothing wrong with me.

302
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,100
It's just procedure. When you're done, you and I will speak.

303
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,260
Can you take him to medical, please?

304
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,960
It's okay, I'll see you in a bit.

305
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,090
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

306
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,840
- Is Jack gonna be here soon? - He's on his way in.

307
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,740
Come with me.

308
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,860
I had no idea he worked in a place like this.

309
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,210
It's just up these stairs.

310
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,180
- Did you know him before? - Yes.

311
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,270
I knew him.

312
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,650
A lot of people here thought you were dead until today.

313
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Yeah, I know. Excuse me.

314
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,770
- Chloe. - Hi, Jack.

315
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,900
- You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay.

316
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,020
We wouldn't have made it out of that airport without your help.

317
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,910
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

318
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,320
Mr. Bauer, Lynn McGill from Division.

319
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,280
Mara, I'll assume custody at this point, thank you.

320
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,740
You're no longer a suspect in President Palmer's murder

321
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,560
but while you're here, you will need this.

322
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,040
It'll give you level two clearance.

323
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,700
Thank you. Was Agent Manning able to apprehend the suspect?

324
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,860
No. It seems the person you identified used the hostage situation

325
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,800
as a cover to steal a cache of weaponized nerve gas from the airport.

326
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,500
Nerve gas? How do you know that?

327
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,650
Following your lead, Curtis found trace

328
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,710
amounts in a hangar adjacent to the terminal.

329
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,540
We don't know how much there is and where it came from,

330
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,660
but it is a military grade chemical weapon.

331
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,540
Do you have any leads?

332
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,700
Not yet, but we're gonna run the search operation from here.

333
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,470
You're not gonna be able to track these terrorists

334
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,370
fast enough with a standard search operation.

335
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,340
The only way you're gonna get that nerve gas in time

336
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,120
is if you find out who ordered the hit on David Palmer.

337
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,520
I  agree.

338
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,650
I think Palmer was about to expose this plot.

339
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,060
I think that's why he was killed.

340
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,870
I also think that if you can help us identify who framed you,

341
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,600
we can intercept this nerve gas while there's still time.

342
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,800
- Hello, Jack. - Hey, Bill.

343
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,730
President's been informed of the nerve gas.

344
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,300
He wants to ensure the media doesn't find out.

345
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,540
Well, make sure Division restricts information flow.

346
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,930
We'll continue this conversation when I'm done.

347
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,780
Good to see you again, Jack.

348
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,200
It's good to see you, too, Bill.

349
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,140
I'm so sorry about Michelle.

350
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,640
I never meant to put her in jeopardy.

351
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,220
Of course, you didn't.

352
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,480
How's Tony doing?

353
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,940
He's still unconscious, but the doctor says he's going to pull through.

354
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,800
Good. We're gonna need to speak to him as soon as possible.

355
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,250
They know to call us.

356
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,150
Jack... Audrey has been working for us.

357
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,210
She's here in the building now?

358
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,280
She's debriefing Diane Huxley.

359
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,650
Why is she talking to Diane?

360
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,330
Lynn asked her to.

361
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,900
I'm not used to calling him Jack.

362
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,090
He said his name was Frank Flynn.

363
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,200
I thought he worked for the oil company.

364
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,520
You probably know more about him than I do.

365
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,380
We all thought he was dead for the last year and a half.

366
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,900
So what do you want to know?

367
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,370
You said that Jack was living with you for the last six months, is that correct?

368
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,210
He was renting a room.

369
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,840
So, you don't have a personal relationship with him?

370
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,860
I'm not sure that's any of your business.

371
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,330
I'm sorry, I just... I need to know how close you and Jack were,

372
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,450
whether he confided in you or not.

373
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,690
Jack's a private person.

374
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,330
I always knew he was keeping something from me. I just never pushed it.

375
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,990
I accepted him for who he was.

376
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,550
Ms. Raines...

377
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,130
whoever he was before...

378
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,850
it doesn't change the way I feel about him.

379
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,130
He was good to me, he was good to my son.

380
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,060
He meant a lot to us. He still does.

381
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,850
I see.

382
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,800
Did anyone ever come by and ask about Jack?

383
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,080
What do you mean?

384
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,840
Someone knew that Jack was alive.

385
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,710
It's critical to our investigation that we find out who that was.

386
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,750
No. No one asked about him. No one ever came to see him.

387
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,870
Can you excuse me for a minute, please?

388
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,920
Yeah.

389
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,560
Jack.

390
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,720
I don't even know where to begin.

391
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,630
You have to believe me. I couldn't tell you I was still alive.

392
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,470
Jack, you don't need to apologize.

393
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,320
I did it for your own protection.

394
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,920
It's been hard for me, thinking you died, believing that I was angry at you...

395
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:50,840
that I hated you. I wasn't able to forgive myself for that.

396
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,070
You had every reason to hate me.

397
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,570
I was responsible for Paul's death. I lied to you.

398
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,500
Jack.

399
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,530
You made a hard decision.

400
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,860
I never imagined I'd get another chance to tell you this.

401
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,270
But I want...

402
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,500
I want you to know that I don't blame you for what happened with Paul.

403
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,020
Thank you.

404
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,980
Jack...

405
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,860
There's so much that I want to say to you, I know it's...

406
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,160
Mr. Bauer. Mr. Buchanan needs to see you.

407
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,300
- I'll be right down. - I should go.

408
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,310
Evelyn, is Mrs. Logan still asleep?

409
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes, she's finally getting some rest.

410
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,900
Good. You should probably start gathering some of her things.

411
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,770
I thought the president was staying through the weekend.

412
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,220
He is... but she'll be leaving today.

413
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,340
Where's she going?

414
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,960
Just make sure she has the essentials

415
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,250
to make her trip comfortable.

416
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,630
Yes, sir.

417
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,750
Edgar said he saw you come in here. What are you doing?

418
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,980
Setting up a new socket.

419
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,510
We're overloaded from the NSA database.

420
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,400
- Why are you here? - Looking for you.

421
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,640
What for?

422
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,680
I need to get into your utilities volume.

423
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,670
Why didn't you message me?

424
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,420
Okay, I wanted to say something, too. Let's not make a big drama out of it.

425
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,450
What?

426
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:16,570
I was unfairly harsh to you a few minutes ago. I didn't mean anything.

427
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,330
All right. Apology accepted.

428
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,040
It wasn't really an apology, it was more of an observation. I mean, the fact...

429
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,320
Spenser.

430
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,170
Damn it, why do I do that?


432
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,270
- Edgar Stiles. - It's Chloe.

433
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,210
What is it?

434
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,970
I need to know Spenser's clearance level?

435
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,100
Why are you asking?

436
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,500
Spenser works for me, and I need to know his clearance level,

437
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,800
so could you please open the header file and give it to me, Edgar?

438
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Fine.

439
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,520
Level three.

440
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,600
Chloe?

441
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,240
Call Buchanan, tell him I need to talk to him now. It's important.

442
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,930
Division sent me.

443
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,630
One of your mainframe servers is cycling slow.

444
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,370
You're not on the manifest.

445
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,970
I was told it'd be taken care of.

446
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,120
I'm going to clear this with the systems administrator.

447
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,790
Are you Hank, from on-site support?

448
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,990
- Yeah. - My fault.

449
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,800
I was supposed to advance him an emergency clearance.

450
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,160
All right. Place the bag on the conveyor belt, and walk right through, sir.

451
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,900
- All clear. - Thank you.

452
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,360
- Thank you. - Thank you.

453
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,930
I'll show you the way.

454
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,380
Mr. Cummings told me it would be best to keep you off the manifest.

455
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,160
Classified material generally runs on servers nine and twelve.

456
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,020
All the information you need on Bauer should be there.

457
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,080
I don't know what files Mr. Cummings asked you to download

458
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,680
but you need to keep vector counts the same,

459
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,720
or it'll get flagged.

460
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,770
I got it.

461
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,500
Okay.

462
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,900
I need to get back to my station.

463
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,960
Evelyn, what are you doing?

464
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,670
Mrs. Logan, are you feeling better?

465
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,950
Why are you packing my things?

466
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,730
Walt Cummings asked me to.

467
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,470
Why?

468
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,820
Where are we going?

469
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,810
I don't know if the president's going with you.

470
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,540
Evelyn, stop. What's going on?

471
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,880
They just asked me to get you ready to leave.

472
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,770
They're sending me to Vermont, aren't they?

473
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,640
Charles is having me committed.

474
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,330
I'm sorry, Mrs. Logan. I honestly don't know anything else.

475
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,080
It's fine.

476
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,780
I'll get dressed.

477
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,860
Edgar, my FGA is locked. Where's Chloe?

478
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,310
How should I know?

479
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,930
- Can you unlock this? - No.

480
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,320
Mr. Wolff? Please come with us.

481
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,520
What do you want?

482
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,470
Mr. Buchanan has ordered us to take you to him immediately.

483
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,490
I'm in the middle of a critical task here.

484
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,500
Mr. Stiles has been authorized to take over your work load.

485
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,900
Did you know about this, Edgar?

486
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,840
Yeah. I just got the bulletin. Sorry.

487
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,090
Mr. Wolff. Please.

488
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,720
I'm coming.

489
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,470
Chloe? Sir. What is going on here?

490
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,110
Sit down, Spenser.

491
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,000
You've been burrowing into classified

492
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,210
CTU protocols without authorization.

493
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,330
I don't know what you're talking about.

494
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,670
Stop-- I know you were logged onto the security subsystem,

495
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,150
where you had no right to be.

496
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,610
We're going through your system so

497
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,000
you might as well tell us now what you were doing.

498
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,140
- I told you I was opening... - That's enough!

499
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,090
You've accessed files outside your clearance level

500
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,700
at least 18 times in the four months you've been here.

501
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,850
Sir, whatever you think you've found, it's a mistake.

502
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,240
I've done nothing wrong.

503
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,700
Come on, Spenser, you obviously have your own agenda here.

504
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,950
I don't have an "agenda."

505
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,560
And while you're at here

506
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,090
why don't you explain why it was necessary to crawl into my bed.

507
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,900
Which certainly wasn't what it appeared to be,

508
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,470
just like your work here isn't what it appears to be!

509
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,340
Chloe, Chloe. Chloe, let me handle this, please.

510
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,470
Sir, obviously you can't take anything she says into consideration.

511
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,880
I was careless.

512
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,630
And, inadvertently, I caused her some emotional pain.

513
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,940
Oh, please.

514
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,130
And now she's trying to get back at me.

515
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,270
I don't think so, Spenser.

516
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,810
Sir, I'd like to talk to a lawyer.

517
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,300
Forget about a lawyer!

518
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,430
We're in the middle of a terrorist crisis

519
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,890
There are lives on the line.

520
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,800
You're going to tell us what you've been doing here,

521
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,730
and you're going to tell us now.

522
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,970
I hope this goes better than when I sent her up there the last time.

523
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,610
Dr. Hill and his staff are on standby if she overreacts.

524
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm not looking forward to this.

525
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,710
Evelyn?

526
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,960
- Mr. President. - Where is she?

527
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,750
She's in the bathroom, sir.

528
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,480
Martha?

529
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,340
Marty?

530
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,370
Are you sure she's in there?

531
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,220
Yes, sir. She's getting dressed.

532
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,520
Marty?

533
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,000
Aaron? My wife is gone.

534
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,680
This is Pierce. We have a priority alert.

535
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,510
The First Lady has left her quarters and is unaccounted for.

536
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,410
All agents in the main wing, move to points north and west.

537
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,000
Anyone spotting her, check in immediately.

538
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,450
So the only people who knew you were alive were David Palmer

539
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,540
Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler and Chloe O'Brian.

540
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,330
Yeah, and at least one other person who killed

541
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,130
David Palmer and tried to frame me for it.

542
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,960
And you don't know who that other person might be?

543
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,240
- No. - Any theories?

544
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,140
About a year and a half ago, David Palmer called me.

545
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,960
Told me there's someone in Logan's administration was targeting me.

546
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,440
Which is why you faked your own death and assumed a new identity?

547
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,020
Yeah, except it didn't work.

548
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,200
I believe that whoever tried to kill me 18 months ago

549
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,480
somehow found out I was still alive,

550
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,150
and waited until today to exploit that information.

551
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,640
Someone inside President Logan's administration?

552
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,000
That's what David Palmer told me

553
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,790
a year and a half ago, and I believe him.

554
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,900
Well, first of all,

555
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,640
that would mean someone in this administration

556
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,760
is also tied to the theft of the nerve gas.

557
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,740
Yeah. You're going to have to look into that.

558
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,250
Even if you're right

559
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,560
there are hundreds of people in Logan's administration.

560
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,270
It would take an investigation of that

561
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,980
magnitude months to gain any traction

562
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,590
and we don't have months to work with.

563
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,630
I'm sorry to interrupt,

564
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,180
but Dr. Paulson is calling from medical.

565
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,020
Put him through.

566
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,540
- Mr. McGill? - Yes?

567
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,170
Tony Almeida's regained consciousness and is in recovery.

568
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,250
Can he talk?

569
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,300
Yes. He's very weak, you'll have to be brief.

570
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,130
Let him know I'll be down in a few minutes.

571
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,650
Tony asked if be could speak to Jack Bauer first.

572
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,600
He says it's important.

573
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,430
He's a friend of mine.

574
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,660
Tell Mr. Almeida that Jack will be down in few moments.

575
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,910
I'll let him know.

576
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,360
Thank you. I'll be right back.

577
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,550
- Jack. - What's going on?

578
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,060
I know you're busy. I...

579
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,040
I just wanted to apologize.

580
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,980
You have nothing to apologize for.

581
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,640
Yes, I do.

582
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,620
I thought you were just another loser

583
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,480
trying to take advantage of my mom.

584
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,350
I was wrong.

585
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,610
You were trying to protect her.

586
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,520
Your mother is lucky to have someone

587
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,340
who loves her as much as you do.

588
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,460
As soon as this is over, I promise you,

589
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,340
you and I are going to get a chance to sit down and talk.

590
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,770
But right now I have to go.

591
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:58,570
Yeah.

592
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,080
Take care of your mother.

593
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,190
Who gave you the Level Five authorization?

594
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,920
Don't look at me. Answer him!

595
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,680
I can't. I can't talk to anyone here about this.

596
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,110
Whatever you were doing is over, Spenser.

597
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,500
Sir, I was able to pull Spenser's screen activity from the archive.

598
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,940
This is what he was looking at ten minutes ago.

599
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,390
Looks like he was using in-house surveillance to track someone through CTU.

600
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,660
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer?

601
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,320
What the hell's going on here, Spenser?

602
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,350
I was following orders.

603
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,400
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer, they have a reason.

604
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,980
Who is they?

605
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,130
I won't say anything else.

606
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,480
Chloe, find security, have them locate Jack now.

607
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,910
- Dr. Paulson? - Yes.

608
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,310
I'm Jack Bauer. Tony Almeida wanted to speak with me.

609
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,540
Oh, of course, Mr. Bauer. Just remember to please keep it brief.

610
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,850
Thank you, sir.

611
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,360
Tony.

612
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,570
Tony, it's Jack.

613
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,450
Jack, you all right?

614
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,970
I think he cracked my rib.

615
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,710
I've been trying to reach you, but the lines were locked out.

616
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,110
What happened? Who is he?

617
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,860
I don't know, but he's a professional.

618
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,980
He killed Dr. Paulson, then he tried to kill me.

619
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,000
You have any idea how he got into CTU?

620
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,480
We identified a mole working in Chloe's department.

621
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,780
- Who? - Spenser Wolff.

622
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,860
We've been interrogating him, but he hasn't talked yet.

623
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,350
- Where is he? - Holding.

624
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,980
Get a doctor down here to monitor Tony Almeida now.

625
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,470
Lock this room down.

626
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,060
Contact Lynn McGill, have him meet me in Holding.

627
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,800
Bring up visual surveillance on Medical Room Two.

628
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,050
Open the door.

629
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,340
I want to show you something. Get up!

630
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,230
Did you let that man into CTU?

631
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,910
This man is a professional assassin.

632
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,820
He just killed Dr. Paulson, and he tried to kill me.

633
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,440
Did you let him into CTU?

634
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,820
No. They told me he was here to place a tap on one of the servers.

635
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,050
- That's all I knew. - Who told you?

636
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,570
I was here as part of an Internal Affairs investigation.

637
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,440
Are you starting to understand how much trouble you are in?

638
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,150
Now, I'm gonna give you one more chance.

639
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,700
Who told you to let that man into CTU?

640
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,860
The White House.

641
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,910
Mr. Cummings in the White House.

642
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,560
Cummings recruited me after I started working here.

643
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,630
He said that they wanted to make sure CTU was operating...

644
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,550
within the rules.

645
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,760
You have to believe me.

646
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,300
I thought I was serving the President.

647
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,520
Yeah. Take him back to Holding.

648
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,150
Walt Cummings killed David Palmer, and he tried to have me killed.

649
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:43,730
Even if it is true, we have to build a case before we call the President.

650
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,980
We don't call the President. He's here in California. We go see him now.

651
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,950
Cummings is the President's Chief of Staff, Jack. And his friend.

652
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,590
Without any hard evidence, CTU can't touch him.

653
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,370
I'm not CTU.

654
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,370
I'll go get Walt Cummings myself.
