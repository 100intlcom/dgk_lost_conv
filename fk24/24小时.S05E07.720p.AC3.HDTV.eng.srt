1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,830
Has Bauer arrived at CTU?

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,270
No, not yet.

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,800
I need you to clear an entrance.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,970
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer?

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,030
What the hell's going on here,

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,470
- Spenser? - I was following orders.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,630
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer, they have a reason.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,000
This man is a professional assassin.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,330
He just killed Dr.Paulson.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,370
He tried to kill me.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,570
Did you let him into CTU?!

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,270
They told me he was here

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,870
to place a tap on one of the servers.

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,830
- That's all I knew. - Who told you?

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,470
The White House.

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,800
Mr.Cummings.

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,500
David Palmer was murdered because he was about to expose

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,870
Walt Cummings' connection to the terrorists.

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,030
You want the nerve gas? Cummings is your connection.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,130
Cummings is the President's chief adviser.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,130
How exactly do you suggest

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,600
we get to him?

23
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,800
I could secretly meet with Mike Novick.

24
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,800
Who did you tell?

25
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,030
Who did you tell?!

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
I didn't tell anybody, Jack!

27
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,130
Tell your men to stand down!

28
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm sorry, sir.We can't do that.

29
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,700
Put your hands in the air!

30
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,870
Sentox gas is being smuggled out of the country

31
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,900
by separatists who think they're going to use it

32
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,300
against the Russians.

33
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,900
However, that nerve gas

34
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,030
will never reach Russian soil.

35
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,470
And you know this how?

36
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,370
We control the remote detonators on those gas canisters.

37
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,100
As soon as they've reached the terrorist base,

38
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,500
we'll trigger the canisters by satellite

39
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,530
and release the gas.

40
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,800
You're a traitor.

41
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,370
You'll let things play out as they are.

42
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,800
Otherwise, your administration will be implicated,

43
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,130
and your presidency will be destroyed.

44
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Mr.President,

45
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,500
my name is Jack Bauer

46
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,900
and I'm sorry to have to confront you like this.

47
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,570
But your Chief of Staff is withholding information

48
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,200
that is vital to this nation's security.

49
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,600
Stop this!

50
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,470
I'm done talking with you.You understand me?

51
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,700
So for the last time, where is the nerve gas?

52
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,460
Stop! Stop!

53
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,230
Stop! Stop! I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

54
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,530
It's on a freighter

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,500
leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

56
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,570
CTU, we've located the target container.

57
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,490
No hostiles present.

58
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,390
You have a green light.

59
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,600
Take possession of the canister.

60
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,430
Open 'em up.Let's go.Open 'em all up.

61
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,870
Empty.Next.Moving on.

62
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,670
What do we got, nothing?!

63
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,170
There are no gas canisters here, CTU.

64
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,700
The nerve gas is not here.

65
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,330
Where are the canisters?

66
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,070
I've told you everything.

67
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,800
We know you've altered the arming codes, Mr.Cummings.

68
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,200
Erwich, listen.

69
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,400
We can negotiate something.

70
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,230
I don't negotiate with my enemies.

71
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,100
I eliminate them.

72
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,930
Your country is about to pay

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,570
a very steep price for betraying us.

74
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,180
The following takes place between 1Pm and 2Pm.

75
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,700
I was approached six months ago by a man named James Nathanson.

76
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,700
He was my contact.

77
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,800
Who is he?

78
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,030
Former CIA.

79
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,970
Said he was recruiting like-minded individuals

80
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,200
for this initiative.

81
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,330
"Initiative."

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Is that what you call this?

83
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,300
You helped terrorists acquire weaponized nerve gas!

84
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,930
I told you we were gonna trigger the canisters

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,470
once the separatists reached their base in Central Asia.

86
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,030
This was not supposed to happen.

87
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,470
But it happened!

88
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,600
You got into bed with these people, and now they're

89
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,570
threatening to use the gas on American citizens!

90
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,130
Oh, you make it sound like our goal was to kill Americans!

91
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,930
What the hell was your goal, Walt?

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,930
Explain that to me.

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,500
We're patriots, Mr.President.

94
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,700
We were acting in the best interests of this country.

95
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,330
How is any of this in our best interest?

96
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,670
Shoring up a strategic partner

97
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,630
in the war on terror,

98
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,330
ensuring a stable flow of oil.

99
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,430
How is any of that not in our national interest?

100
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,430
I have Chloe O'Brian's on the line for Jack Bauer.

101
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,600
Chloe, are you set up for the trace?

102
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,170
All set, Jack.

103
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,970
We're ready to call Nathanson.

104
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,630
How long do I have to keep him on the line?

105
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,930
Until I give you a signal.

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
Chloe, dial the number.

107
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,070
The line's been disconnected, Jack.

108
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,870
There's nothing to grab onto.

109
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,200
They must know something went wrong.

110
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,830
He's gone dark.

111
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,270
- Damn it, Walt! - I don't want

112
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,530
this weapon deployed on US soil any more than you do,

113
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,200
but Nathanson cannot help you now and neither can I.

114
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,630
These terrorists are operating on their own.

115
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,020
Mr.President, I think he's telling the truth.

116
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,030
He can't help us, not anymore.

117
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,000
Aaron

118
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,780
get him out of here.

119
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,730
Yes, sir.

120
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,130
Jack.

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,620
What do we do now?

122
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,320
I need to be debriefed.

123
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,670
After that, I'm leaving, sir.

124
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,070
Given the current situation,

125
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,270
things have become more complicated.

126
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,800
CTU is gonna have to be responsible

127
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,730
for the retrieval of the canisters.

128
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,230
Why are you leaving?

129
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,530
Sir, I have a daughter

130
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,470
that doesn't know that I'm still alive.

131
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,600
If I have to disappear again, in all fairness to her,

132
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,800
I don't think she should know.

133
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,700
Jack, terrorists just threatened

134
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,230
to deploy chemical weapons on US soil.

135
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,600
They have the ability to kill millions of people.

136
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,000
I understand that, Mr.President,

137
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,030
and I believe that CTU can handle this.

138
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,120
Jack, your experience can make

139
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,030
a crucial difference in stopping them.

140
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,030
Look...you and I have a complicated history.

141
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,070
I realize that.

142
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,970
And I'm not naive enough to expect

143
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,600
any special personal allegiance from you.

144
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,300
But I know your respect for this office

145
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,630
and your concern for this country

146
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,870
is just as strong as it was when you served

147
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,830
under David Palmer.

148
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,570
I'm asking for your help,

149
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,170
just until this crisis is over.

150
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,800
I will reinstate you.

151
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,800
I will give you

152
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,930
all the support you need.

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,130
Mr.President, you and I...

154
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,500
Jack, please!

155
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,770
For God's sake, we need to recover this nerve gas

156
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,300
before it's too late.

157
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,600
Micro-circuitry on this remote has been tampered with.

158
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,370
As far as I can tell, unless we can repair it,

159
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,700
we can't arm the canisters.

160
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,470
Rossler will have a way.

161
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,930
He should have called by now.

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,500
Our real enemy is Russia.

163
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,370
We should be figuring out another way to get back home,

164
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,700
not wasting time trying to use the gas against the Americans.

165
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,600
Question my orders again, and I will kill you.

166
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,670
Do you understand?

167
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,800
They've closed the ports.

168
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,570
They will hunt us until they find us.

169
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,900
So if we cannot use the gas against Russia,

170
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,030
we will use it against America.

171
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,270
Get up.

172
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,300
Hello?

173
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,400
Lynn?

174
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,000
Jenny, now is a really bad time.

175
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,130
Yeah, I know you're busy,

176
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,830
but I need to see you, please.

177
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,470
What is it?

178
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,730
I need some help.

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,270
You mean money.

180
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,730
Lynn, I'm clean.

181
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,200
I'm working two jobs and busting my ass

182
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,800
to put my life back together.

183
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,530
How much?

184
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,330
$500.

185
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,700
Can I, can I come over there?

186
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,500
Absolutely not.

187
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,930
Why?

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,170
Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?

189
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,370
Yeah, I am.

190
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,730
Lynn, I got nobody else to turn to.

191
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,770
You know, I can't go back on the street again.

192
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,870
If you don't help me,

193
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,470
I swear I'm going to hurt myself.

194
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,830
For God's sakes, Lynn, I'm your sister.

195
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,730
All right, listen.

196
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,730
Jenny, listen.

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,970
There's a parking lot across the street from CTU.

198
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,170
I'll meet you there in 20 minutes.

199
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,530
Okay.

200
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,700
Thank you, Lynn.

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,730
Sorry I'm late.

202
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,530
I was just explaining that

203
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Cummings provided us with a schematic

204
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,900
of one of the canisters.

205
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,470
Triggering mechanisms

206
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,830
on the canisters can only be activated via satellite relay.

207
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,770
Cummings says the terrorists have been given

208
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,300
invalid detonation codes.

209
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,030
Then these canisters are useless to them.

210
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,300
Unless they can find a way

211
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,600
to control the triggering mechanism.

212
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,700
Are we running evacuation scenarios?

213
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,430
Evacuation isn't feasible,

214
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,400
not without a time frame or a target.

215
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,900
Erwich's threat was intentionally vague.

216
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,900
What are we doing to track these canisters?

217
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,930
Chloe?

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,030
I pulled a voice print

219
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,400
from Erwich's call to Cummings

220
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,330
and I'm doing a scan of all satcom chatter.

221
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,070
If Erwich is in contact with anyone on that bandwidth,

222
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,230
we should be able to intercept and trace the call.

223
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,670
We better get lucky

224
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,200
cause we just got a new assessment from Civil Defense.

225
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,870
They're estimating that the nerve gas from each canister

226
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,700
will create kill zones between one and three square miles.

227
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,900
The terrorists are in possession of 20 canisters.

228
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,930
We're talking about potential casualties

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,100
in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps over a million.

230
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,470
Yeah?

231
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,230
Ivan Erwich?

232
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,230
Go ahead.

233
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,930
Jacob Rossler.

234
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,630
I was asked to call you by a friend in Moscow.

235
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,830
You've been briefed on our situation?

236
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,930
You need to reconfigure

237
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,900
the remote trigger for an Aatox chemical delivery system, right?

238
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

239
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,870
You have the canisters with you?

240
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,170
Yes.

241
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,770
You'll need to start by cutting into them.

242
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,170
Listen carefully to my instructions.

243
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,970
O'Brian.

244
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,300
We just got a pattern match.

245
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,970
Send me the hit.

246
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,300
All interagency search protocols are being run through CTU.

247
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,330
Ken, no one is going around you.

248
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
All right, I'll make sure

249
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,870
that you're apprised in real time.

250
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,930
Audrey, I thought you should know.

251
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,100
Logan has asked Jack

252
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,870
to be reinstated on a provisional basis.

253
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,800
He's been given full autonomy and access.

254
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,170
We got a possible intercept on Erwich.

255
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,770
This just happened.

256
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,370
On the inner casing,

257
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,170
you will find a display window with a seven-digit readout.

258
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,830
I'll need them.

259
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,430
And then what?

260
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,000
I will program a new chip for your remote trigger.

261
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,030
Put me through to Jack Bauer.

262
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,700
Voice print is a 95% match.It's Erwich.

263
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,970
He was on a sat-phone.

264
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,330
I can't trace it,

265
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,370
but the call originated from a landline downtown.

266
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,530
This is Bauer.

267
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,730
Jack, we may have a lead on Erwich.

268
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,900
I'm listening.

269
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,170
We intercepted a call between Erwich

270
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,370
and an unknown associate.

271
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,630
We weren't able to trace Erwich,

272
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,870
but we may have a location

273
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,900
for the associate.

274
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,670
22 North Figueroa, a penthouse.

275
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,030
Chloe, bring up the building manifest.

276
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,470
- See who's in there. - On it.

277
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,000
From what we heard, Erwich is trying to acquire

278
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,530
some kind of activation code.

279
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,800
Yeah, he's trying to reconfigure the trigger mechanism

280
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,200
so he can disperse the Sentox.

281
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,670
Bill, we're running out of time.

282
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,900
Okay, the penthouse is leased

283
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,430
to a man named Jacob Rossler.

284
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,470
Cross-checking.

285
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,800
He's a software programmer

286
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,000
indicted for high security code infiltration,

287
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,370
identity theft.

288
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,700
Never convicted.

289
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,600
Okay, I'm gonna need schematics on the building

290
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,200
and vectors for every entrance.

291
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,230
We'll have it for you by the time you get there.

292
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,830
Bill, we're going to need to go in covertly.

293
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,000
Have Curtis meet me at the location

294
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,370
with a small team of four.

295
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,430
But tell them to stay out of sight until I get there.

296
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,270
Right.

297
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,530
We'll be in touch.

298
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
This is our new destination.

299
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,900
They'll clear a landing zone for you.

300
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,930
Mr.Buchanan, this building's security system

301
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,670
uses proprietary technology.

302
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,730
It's a high-end platform.

303
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,070
It's a bitch to hack into,

304
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,400
especially with the time constraints we're under.

305
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,670
So, get Edgar to help you.

306
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,770
Spenser is better.

307
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,230
Chloe, absolutely out of the question.

308
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,520
Spenser can do this faster

309
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,900
than Edgar and I put together.

310
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,970
He wrote an infiltration code

311
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,630
that took us four months to hack.

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,230
- That's a bad idea. - Stay out of this, Edgar.

313
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,970
He didn't know Cummings was dirty.

314
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,170
His polygraph proved that.

315
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,270
He's was spying on us.

316
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,400
He was spying on you.

317
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,800
He lied to you.

318
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,930
Sir, if you don't let Spenser help us do this,

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,230
we're not going to get it done in time.

320
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,330
He has to wear a security wristband

321
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,470
and be under constant supervision.

322
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,830
Fine.

323
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,030
Audrey Raines.

324
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,330
Audrey, it's Jack.

325
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Hey.

326
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,830
Listen, I wanted to tell you myself,

327
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,270
the president asked me to stay on

328
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,030
until the canisters were retrieved.

329
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,530
I heard that you were reinstated.

330
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,130
Jack, you know what this means.

331
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,170
You'll be exposed.

332
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,430
CTU can handle the crisis.

333
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Audrey. The President thinks that I can help.

334
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,600
Jack, you don't owe them this.

335
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,070
Listen, Audrey, the reason why I called:

336
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,130
I need to ask you to do me a favor.

337
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,670
What?

338
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,000
Kim doesn't know I'm alive yet.

339
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,100
I don't want her to find out the wrong way.

340
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,670
Do you want me to tell her?

341
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,270
No, I just want you to call her

342
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,400
and bring her in to CTU.

343
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,700
I'll see her when I get back.

344
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,070
All right.

345
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,870
Are you sure you're comfortable doing this for me?

346
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,000
Of course.

347
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,800
Thank you.

348
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,700
Sure.

349
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,570
Yeah.

350
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,800
Well, your swing arm needs to be replaced.

351
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,670
With parts you're looking at $475.

352
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,600
Yeah.We're open till 5:00.

353
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,900
Okeydoke.

354
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,070
Can I help you?

355
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,300
Do you have some kind of

356
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,630
precision tool for cutting metal?

357
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,260
Sure.

358
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,870
Where is everyone else?

359
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,330
Lunch.Why?

360
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,800
I need you to do some work for us.

361
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,830
And we need it done fast.

362
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,330
If you do it, you'll live.

363
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,500
Do you understand?

364
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,830
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,300
Just take it easy.

366
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,160
Why haven't I gotten an update?

367
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,630
Bauer left here on some sort of lead.

368
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,490
Find out if CTU is any closer

369
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,030
to recovering the nerve gas.

370
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,470
Yes, sir.

371
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,360
How are you feeling?

372
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,160
Remarkably well...

373
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,990
for someone whose husband tried to have her committed

374
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
without so much as a good-bye.

375
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,660
I'm sorry.

376
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,400
I didn't come here to fight with you.

377
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,230
You have every right to.

378
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,130
The two of us used to be a pretty good team.

379
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,970
Do you remember?

380
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,930
I was the one you would always come to first for advice.

381
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,300
I remember.

382
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,370
We've got to get back to that relationship, Charles.

383
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,260
You're right, things are going to get rough for you.

384
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,290
And you are going to need me

385
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,970
and everything that I can give you.

386
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,530
I don't know what to say, Martha.

387
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,830
Don't you ever do that to me again.

388
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,430
Mike, please, come in.

389
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,560
Mr.President.

390
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,170
Mrs.Logan.

391
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,730
Mike.

392
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,130
Mike, I owe you a profound apology.

393
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,390
You were in an impossible situation, sir.

394
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,570
I understand why you did what you did...

395
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,760
No.

396
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,930
I panicked, Mike, that's it.

397
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,690
Plain and simple.

398
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm not proud of how I handled myself.

399
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,530
I intend to make it right

400
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,530
from this point on.

401
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,300
I'd like you to resume your duties.

402
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,300
Thank you, Mike.

403
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,160
CTU is in the process of tracking down

404
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,760
the canisters,

405
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,930
but we still have to deal

406
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,860
with the issue of Walt Cummings.

407
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
It's all right, Mike.

408
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,300
I would like Martha's input on this.

409
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,430
So what do we do about Walt?

410
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,630
We can't detain him indefinitely.

411
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,000
Maybe not, but we can keep him out of sight long enough

412
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,700
for us to construct a credible narrative.

413
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,470
Mike...

414
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,170
are you talking about a cover-up?

415
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,600
I mean, exercising discretion

416
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,200
to spare this country unnecessary humiliation.

417
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,830
Walt Cummings was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.

418
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,470
He has allowed these terrorists

419
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,000
to get their hands on weaponized nerve gas

420
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,530
- that is at this point  - With respect...

421
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,500
- a very real and present threat - With respect...

422
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Mrs.Logan,

423
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,000
if we go public with Cummings,

424
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,830
the president's reputation won't be the only casualty.

425
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,500
The credibility of this office will be destroyed.

426
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,270
Charles, you are going to take a hit on this.

427
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,900
But you won't be destroyed.

428
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,200
You did nothing wrong except to trust someone

429
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,200
who betrayed you.

430
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,400
You are human.

431
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,570
You might be overestimating

432
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,800
the public's capacity for forgiveness.

433
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,270
No.I'm not.

434
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,330
The only thing they won't forgive

435
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,090
is being lied to.

436
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,460
I think you should issue a statement to the press,

437
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,400
and the sooner the better.

438
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,400
I agree.

439
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,330
Why don't you and I work on it together,

440
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,500
see what we come up with.

441
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,870
Great.

442
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,170
Chloe.

443
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,600
Go to Station 3.We don't have much time.

444
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,430
Thanks for getting me reinstated.

445
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,300
I only did it because I need your help

446
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,300
getting Jack through the high-security building,

447
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,400
not because I forgive you because I don't.

448
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,600
Have a seat.

449
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,600
We need to gain access to the security server

450
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,300
at 22 North Figueroa.

451
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,430
It's a proprietary network, so get to work.

452
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,200
Chloe?

453
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,070
I swear, I thought I was falling...

454
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,400
I don't care, Spencer.

455
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,400
CTU, they've got eyes and ears on building security.

456
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,430
We have two units,

457
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,470
one east, one west of the building.

458
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,300
Chloe, do you copy?

459
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,570
We're here, Jack.

460
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,070
Spenser's countervailing

461
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,500
the building's security protocols.

462
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,770
What are you talking about?

463
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,330
Spenser's under arrest.

464
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,270
Buchanan released him from holding.

465
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,630
Fine, just give me Rossler's position.

466
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
I've hacked into the building's motion sensors.

467
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,700
According to them, Rossler is still

468
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,930
in the penthouse.

469
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,930
I have two guards on the penthouse level.

470
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,170
What about the ground level entrance?

471
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,870
There's one guard, three surveillance cameras.

472
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,400
Okay.Stand by to take out all security cameras

473
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,600
that are covering the front desk and the elevators.

474
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,130
I can only shut them down for 60 seconds.

475
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,630
After that, they will reboot automatically.

476
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,500
That's as long as you have to subdue the lobby guard.

477
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,870
Copy that.

478
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,530
Teams A and B, you will remain in a holding position

479
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,530
till you get a "go" code.

480
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,700
We are three minutes out.

481
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,000
We have to cross the street

482
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,970
to get to Rossler's building.

483
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,330
Yes?

484
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,300
We're ready to cut

485
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,030
into the canisters.

486
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,400
You have to cut precisely ten centimeters

487
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,900
from the bottom of the casing

488
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,400
to reveal the trigger.

489
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,300
How thick is the outer casing?

490
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,030
Five millimeters.

491
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,230
Call me with the identification numbers when you're done.

492
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,930
We're in position.

493
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,430
We're set.We're ready to go.

494
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,100
Give me a few seconds to access control.

495
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,330
Okay.Here we go, Jack.

496
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,270
On my mark.

497
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,700
Camera's dark.

498
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,270
Federal agent.Let me see your hands!

499
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,900
Let me see your hands!

500
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,170
Elevator code, let's have it.

501
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,070
Uh...four, zero, seven, three, pound.

502
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,970
Unit one, status check.

503
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,770
Just lost cameras A and C.

504
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,870
Tell him you don't know why the cameras went down,

505
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,970
but everything is okay.

506
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,330
Everything is okay.

507
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,170
Status check: blue.

508
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,630
Don't know why the cameras are out.

509
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,330
Everything's fine down here.

510
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,800
Turn around.

511
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,930
Back up to me.Back up to me.

512
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,600
Where are the elevators?

513
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,630
The elevator's almost there.

514
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,800
You have two floors to go.

515
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,770
The camera reboots in ten seconds,

516
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,430
then you'll be visible.

517
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,230
Move.Move!

518
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,370
Unit one, status check.

519
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,070
Where are you?

520
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,130
You tell him you had to use the men's room.

521
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,330
Base,headed to the men's room.

522
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,100
Something's wrong.

523
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,370
Yes?

524
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,170
Mr.Rossler?

525
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,130
We may have a situation.

526
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,800
What kind of situation?

527
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,730
I'm not sure.

528
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,670
Please remain in your office

529
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,800
until you get the all clear.

530
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,470
The guards look suspicious.

531
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,100
One of them has an automatic weapon.

532
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,200
Copy that.

533
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,130
Federal Agents.

534
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,470
You okay?

535
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,800
Yeah.Go ahead.Get my vest.

536
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,370
- Rossler's on the move. - Where is he?

537
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,770
9:00.

538
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,330
Federal agent.Drop the weapon!

539
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,370
Drop the weapon!

540
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,100
Put your hands behind your head.

541
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,730
Do it!

542
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,570
Interlock your fingers.

543
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,000
Rossler is in custody.

544
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,030
I repeat: Rossler is in custody.

545
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,930
All backup teams move in.I need a medic.

546
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,530
We're patching you into the Situation Room.

547
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,130
Someone else is in the penthouse, Jack.

548
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,370
Where?

549
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,030
In the bedroom, to your right.North side.

550
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,600
Curtis, cover him.

551
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,530
I got him.

552
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,000
Let me see your hands.

553
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,430
Let me see your hands!

554
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,800
Don't shoot.

555
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,770
Who are you?

556
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,100
I'm Inessa.

557
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,870
Who did that to you?

558
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,600
You are the police?

559
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,530
Counterterrorist unit, Los Angeles.

560
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,030
He is holding me here.

561
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,370
I want to go home.

562
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,300
You need to cut

563
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,630
into the outer casing exactly ten centimeters from the bottom.

564
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,430
The casting is five millimeters thick.

565
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
You cannot puncture the inner lining.

566
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,330
What's in these things?

567
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,800
Don't worry.Just do what I say.

568
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,000
Just...Can't you tell me what this is all about?

569
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,370
Do you have a family, Cal?

570
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,070
A wife.

571
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,770
My wife is in prison.

572
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,430
She's been there for seven years.

573
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,270
Her only crime was to support me while I fought for my country.

574
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,770
My son lives in a state-run facility

575
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,900
He does not even remember what I look like.

576
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,500
You want to know what this is about?

577
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,330
Justice.It's about ending tyranny.

578
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,600
When you're finished,

579
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,870
we will leave.

580
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,630
You won't hurt me?

581
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,470
You're not my enemy.

582
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,600
The government is my enemy.

583
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,800
Hey.

584
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,870
You have my word.

585
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,330
Begin.

586
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,630
It's all right.

587
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
You're all right.

588
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,700
Just take a seat.

589
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,330
You're safe now.

590
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,170
Have a medic take a look at her.

591
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,200
I want CT to do a full background check.

592
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,230
I don't mind that they've dressed his wound,

593
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
but make sure they don't give him anything for the pain.

594
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,400
Yes, sir.

595
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,100
Curtis.Put him in a chair.

596
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,000
All right, let's go.Get him up.

597
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Easy on my leg.

598
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,470
Just get him over there.

599
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,930
My name is Jack Bauer.

600
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,730
I'm with CTU.

601
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,700
25 minutes ago you contacted a man named Ivan Erwich.

602
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,230
What did he want you to do for him?

603
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,000
I want my lawyer.

604
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,420
You'll get a lawyer as soon as I get what I need.

605
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,590
Mr.Erwich is in possession of 20 canisters

606
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,790
of Sentox-VX nerve gas, which he has

607
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,290
threatened to deploy here in the United States.

608
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,730
I guess you have a problem.

609
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,490
No, sir.You have a problem.

610
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,990
You've been conspiring with and aiding a known terrorist

611
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,790
which means I get to hold you for as long as I want.

612
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,760
Now, we know Mr.Erwich can't deploy the canisters

613
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,460
unless he reconfigures the trigger mechanism.

614
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,820
Is that what he wanted you to do?

615
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,690
Trust me.You don't want to go down this road with me.

616
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,360
Go to hell.

617
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,420
That's exactly where I'm going to send you

618
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,100
unless you start to cooperate.

619
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,460
You like hurting girls?

620
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,330
Curtis.

621
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,360
When I finish with you,

622
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,370
you're gonna wish you felt this good again.

623
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,730
Where is Erwich?!

624
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,160
I want full immunity.

625
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,820
Unfreezing of all my assets.

626
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,860
And transport

627
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,500
to a foreign country of my choosing.

628
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,000
No.

629
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,230
I need Inessa.

630
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,560
She comes with me.

631
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,560
That's the deal.

632
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,920
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

633
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,090
We're not making a deal.

634
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,500
Curtis.

635
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,360
Jack, it's Lynn.

636
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,470
Go ahead.

637
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,560
We don't have the luxury to engage in brinkmanship.

638
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,590
He's gonna tell us what we want to know.

639
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,690
You may be right, but we're not gonna wait around to find out.

640
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,970
Accept the deal.

641
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,560
That's an order.

642
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,690
Fine.It's your call.

643
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,560
We're signing off.

644
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,570
Make sure he follows through.

645
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,990
I'll be back in a few minutes.

646
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,730
I've been instructed to accept your proposal.

647
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,250
A certified agreement,

648
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,060
signed by the Attorney General.

649
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,160
When I see that, I'll tell you what you want.

650
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,130
But remember,

651
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,630
I want Inessa.

652
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,560
Your immunity agreement is being drawn up.

653
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,540
Now I want something.

654
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,860
Where's Erwich?

655
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,600
I have no idea.

656
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,060
I don't know the man.

657
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,830
Not even what he looks like.

658
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,700
I first spoke with him 30 minutes ago.

659
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,850
We were put in contact through a mutual associate in Russia.

660
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,160
Who?

661
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,370
Sergei Voronov.

662
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,720
He's a commander in the resistance movement.

663
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,070
What's Erwich want?

664
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,670
He wants to reprogram the chip

665
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,930
of the trigger.

666
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,130
He's calling me back

667
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,830
with the identification keys.

668
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,370
What's your time frame?

669
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,000
Within the hour.

670
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,070
How is he going to receive the package?

671
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,630
I was going to deliver it.

672
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,930
We haven't agreed on a meeting place.

673
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,000
I want that chip.

674
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,570
It's in a safe place.

675
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Once I see some paperwork,

676
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,360
I'll show it to you.

677
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,200
I want you to be ready to fit that chip with a transponder

678
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,330
so we can track him.

679
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,900
Okay.

680
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,200
Buchanan.

681
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,530
Bill, it's Jack.

682
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,200
Where are we with Rossler's immunity agreement?

683
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,430
We have the Attorney General's sanction.

684
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,830
You should have the documents in a few minutes.

685
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,200
Okay, good.

686
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,070
Did we get any information on the girl?

687
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,270
There isn't much.

688
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,400
Inessa Kovalevsky.

689
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,530
Reported missing 19 months ago from Kiev.

690
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,470
The assumption is, she was kidnapped

691
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,800
by traffickers in the sex slave trade.

692
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,530
She's 15, Jack.

693
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,330
15?

694
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,130
Okay, thanks, Bill.

695
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
I'll get back to you.

696
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,170
You can't take the girl.

697
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,430
Then you don't have a deal.

698
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,730
You'll have your immunity, your freedom.

699
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Leave the girl out of this.

700
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,330
No.

701
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,770
Inessa is all I care about.

702
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,400
She comes with me,

703
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,470
or you lose Erwich.

704
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,690
I've almost finished compiling those surveillance protocols.

705
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,630
Whatever you have, port it over to Edgar's station.

706
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,800
Why?

707
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,730
He'll be finishing that task.

708
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,170
Fine.

709
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Chloe, don't you understand?

710
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,600
I know.

711
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,470
I'm glad you do.

712
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,200
You don't work here anymore, Spenser.

713
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,770
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

714
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,130
What?

715
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,390
Your reinstatement was temporary.

716
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,160
Just until we got Rossler into custody.

717
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,870
But there's still a lot of stuff that has to be done here.

718
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,400
We pulled people from Division.

719
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,500
We don't need you anymore.

720
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,630
These men will escort you out.

721
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,230
I know that was hard, but you did the right thing.

722
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,970
Shut up, Edgar.

723
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,830
You're right.We don't need that part.

724
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,330
Okay, "I promise a full and open inquiry

725
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,730
into this matter."

726
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,870
"I will not rest until I've restored"

727
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,530
"the faith that you have placed in this office"

728
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,430
"and I can demonstrate to you, the American people"

729
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,170
"that I bear its mantle of responsibility"

730
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,630
"with respect and deep humility."

731
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,970
See, this way,

732
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,370
you're assuming responsibility for Walt's actions,

733
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,570
but you're also personally taking the initiative

734
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,170
to bring him to justice.

735
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,830
Well, I'd like to run it by Mike, but I think it works.

736
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,800
I think it's the right move, Charles.

737
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,430
Thank you for letting me help you.

738
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,660
I'm glad to have your help.

739
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,670
Been a long time since you and I have worked together like this.

740
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,170
Yes?

741
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,970
Mr.President.Mike.

742
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,030
What is it, Mike?

743
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,370
I think you should come here.I'm in the west hallway.

744
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,870
What's going on?

745
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,670
Just come here, sir.

746
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,300
I'm on my way.

747
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,830
Good.

748
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,230
Cut him down.

749
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,990
Thanks for meeting me.You got the money?

750
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,660
Jenny, I'm not here to bring you money.

751
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,110
Here's the name of a doctor.

752
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,630
He's a good man.I want you to call him.

753
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,930
I'll pay all the expenses.

754
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,950
It won't cost you a cent.

755
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,660
We'll call him together.

756
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,230
I can't.

757
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,230
Don't hurt him.Oh, my God.

758
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,330
Hurry up.

759
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,630
Let's go.

760
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,060
I'm sorry.

761
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,430
Come on!

762
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,300
Rossler's been given a shot for the pain.

763
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,570
We have air and land pursuit units on standby.

764
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,030
As soon as he moves out, we'll be ready.

765
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,630
No one's going anywhere unless Erwich makes that call.

766
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,800
Stand by the phones.Excuse me.

767
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,470
Audrey Raines.

768
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,470
It's me.

769
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,770
Hey.Did you manage to get a hold of Kim?

770
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,570
No.I tried her, but she wasn't in.

771
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,900
I left a message.

772
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,930
Would you mind trying again for me, please?

773
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,130
Sure.

774
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,530
Okay, thanks.

775
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,160
I want to contact my family.

776
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,270
They must be so very worried about me.

777
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,130
I-I need to explain something to you first.

778
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,900
Please, sit down.

779
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,270
For now...

780
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,630
we need you to go with Mr.Rossler.

781
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,130
Just-Just for now.

782
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,600
Men like me, agents, are going to follow you.

783
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,900
And when we get what we need from Mr.Rossler,

784
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,330
they're going to move in

785
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,700
and they're gonna take you away from him.

786
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,230
You don't know what he does to me when we're alone.

787
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,800
I promise you, I won't let him be alone with you.

788
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,970
I don't believe you.

789
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,530
I won't do it.

790
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,860
Please, let...

791
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,030
Let me go.

792
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,900
I'm sorry.I can't.

793
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,330
Then you are no different than Rossler.

794
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,170
I am not Rossler.

795
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,260
Look at me.

796
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,020
I won't let anything happen to you.

797
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,230
I promise.

798
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,200
We need you to get dressed, please.

799
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,700
Thank you.

800
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,370
Good job.

801
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,600
That's it.

802
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,630
Load the canisters.Get rid of the body.

803
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,930
Pick it up.

804
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,530
Yes?

805
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,070
We have the identification keys.

806
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,830
I'm messaging them to you now.

807
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,070
I've got them.

808
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,370
How long will it take you to reprogram the chip

809
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,800
and deliver it back to us?

810
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,300
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

811
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,670
You and I need a place where we can meet.

812
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,170
You're coming personally?

813
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,900
Unless you have someone who can install

814
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,230
and program a coded binary chip.

815
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,700
I'll call you back in five minutes with the location.

816
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,870
I'll be here.

817
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,330
Get him set up for a wire.

818
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,800
I'll get the girl.

819
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,830
Yes, sir.

820
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,630
Mr.Rossler, in a minute,

821
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,570
we're going to be implanting a transmitter.

822
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,630
We're ready to go.

823
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,300
It's going to be fine.

824
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,030
What's happening?

825
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,330
Couldn't complete the trace.

826
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,830
We've narrowed it down to a ten-block radius.

827
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Okay.Thanks.

828
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,400
No! Hold your fire!

829
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,030
Get a medic in here now!

830
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,630
Inessa, give me the gun.

831
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,630
I know you don't want to hurt anybody else.

832
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,100
Is he gonna make it?

833
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,770
No.He's dead.

834
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,400
Rossler was our only link to those canisters.

835
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,670
Erwich's gonna call here any minute.

836
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,930
He's gonna expect to talk to him.
