1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,440
jacksonville,florida

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,210
you want grapefruit or cranberry?

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,270
Coffee.

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,620
Cranberry it is.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,050
Take it easy on the butter.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,830
Is half a stick too much?

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,570
Yeah,well,I'm just following doctor's orders.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,470
It--it would be nice if you did the same.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:32,970
Hey,look.

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,490
Laura sent the pictures from her orlando trip.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,890
I wonder if there are any of that new guy that she's so crazy about.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,720
Oh,wait a minute.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,290
I thought she said...

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,490
I thought she said pictures,not a video.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,080
That's a dvd,mary.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,580
Technology isn't slowing down.

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,870
It's actually passing you by.

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,680
If you don't catch up soon,you'll be as pitiful as your mother.

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,000
Well,that's motivation.

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,830
Come on,mary.I could show you a few things.

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,710
You afraid to be my student?

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,140
"Hi,guys.

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,810
Just wanted to let you know I'm having a great time.Miss you both.

24
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,470
" Sweet.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,580
Aw,but sooner or later...

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,030
wait a minute.This...

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,140
is that laura?

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,150
The one it can't be.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,030
frank,what's happening?

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,000
oh,my god.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
this was sent to the family?

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,900
Father had a heart condition,died while watching it.

33
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,020
so the music's not added like a regular soundtrack.

34
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,490
It's in the background,so if you turn it down,you also turn down the voices.

35
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,370
Well,can't we get garcia to separate the audio tracks?

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,160
She's working on it noW.

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,520
Well,the sooner we hear how he talks to the victim,the sooner we'll know what kind of man we're dealing with.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,840
Tell us about laura clemensen.

39
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,590
20 years old.

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,620
Sophomore at jacksonville university in florida.

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,020
Assumed to be the fifth in a series of rapes and murders over the past 2 years.

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
Some women were abducted in parking lots,others while they were running.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,190
And when was she reported missing?

44
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,640
Technically she wasn'T.

45
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,490
Roommate thought she was visiting family.

46
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,850
Family thought she was at school.

47
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,020
Close to her family?

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,130
Very.She had dinner with them on sunday.

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,070
That was 5 days ago,and nobody's seen her until now.

50
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,870
She wasn't killed on the tape.

51
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,840
And given forensics,other victims were tortured for weeks before they were killed,so

52
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,800
I think we should operate as if she's still alive.

53
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,380
Not for long,if the bastard gets his way.

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,560
Ok,I don't get it.

55
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,310
This is the fifth abduction and now the second dvd.

56
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,730
Why'd they wait to call this in?

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,820
The last victim's family received this dvd 2 months ago.

58
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,760
Jacksonville P.D.Thought maybe they'd get some more clues instead of just raise more questions.

59
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,070
Can you turn that down,please?

60
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,070
There seems to be a natural escalation to the murders.

61
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,180
It began as brutal attacks against the victims,and now it's psychological attacks to the families.

62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,670
So if the thrill of the kill isn't enough to satisfy his sadistic needs,he needs to spread panic,and he thrives on that.

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,720
Sadistic killers are typically strangers to their victims.

64
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,490
It's--it's easier for the offender to torture and kill someone that they don't know.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,580
Offenders.

66
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,010
Man on the tape isn't doing this just for himself.

67
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,090
He's playing to an audience,not her family.

68
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,800
Someone watching...

69
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,620
who can appreciate what he's doing,admire his sadistic skills.

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,530
It is a characteristic of partners to record their crimes so they can relive the fantasy later.

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,850
How can we be sure?

72
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,710
Right there.The camera moves.

73
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,090
one guy tortures while the other records it.

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,280
Master and servant.

75
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,390
Jacksonville P.D.'S been looking for this killer for years.

76
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,610
How long is it gonna take 'em to find a team?

77
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,510
Mark twain once wrote,"of all the animals,"man is the only one that is cruel.

78
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,570
"He is the only one that inflicts pain for the pleasure of doing it.

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,300
" Again.

80
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,120
That's the third time he's looked back at the camera.

81
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,260
He's looking back at his partner.

82
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,850
Hotch: These two are clearly deranged and acting out their worst sadistic fantasies.

83
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,110
Foile ?deux.

84
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,140
Rare psychological phenomenon in which 2 or more people share the same psychotic delusion.

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,830
In its literal translation,yes,but it often refers to the bond that exists between 2 people that bring out the worst in each other.

86
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:30,920
Most killing teams have a dominant personality that instigates and plans and a submissive one who's the eager accomplice.

87
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,240
So how do they decide who gets to kill?

88
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,810
Well,the dominant one will usually insist on taking the life.

89
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,320
So what's the psychology behind making these dvds?

90
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:44,120
It's a shared souvenir,allows the dominant to keep the submissive one motivated,loyal,and aroused.

91
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,990
It's also about control.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,300
Built-in insurance policy for blackmail,just in case somebody gets cold feet.

93
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,670
It makes you wonder what might have happened if these 2 people never had met.

94
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,770
Chances are the women would still be alive.

95
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,590
Jacksonville P.D.Just located laura clemensen's body.

96
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,950
Some hikers found her under a bridge.

97
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,310
They never hide them.They're always easy to find.

98
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,880
Guys,laura clemensen wasn't missing for more than a week.

99
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,200
The time spent torturing's getting shorter.

100
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,380
Has her mother been notified?

101
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,990
No.Not yet.

102
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,380
We can cover more ground if we split up.

103
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,800
Morgan and I'll meet local P.D.At the scene.

104
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,060
I'll talk to laura clemensen's mother,and since she just lost her husband...

105
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,060
I'll go with you.

106
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,970
I'll start with the victimology,maybe find the reason why these women were targeted.

107
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,110
Mary: After frank and i watched that video,I-- I knew.

108
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,440
At least she isn't suffering anymore.

109
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,200
Is there anything that we can do for you?

110
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,920
Um,F...

111
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,280
frank gave laura a-- a pearl and diamond ring for graduation.

112
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,850
Could I get it back?

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,760
I will look into that right away.

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you.

115
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,490
As part of our investigation,we're trying to gain some insight into your daughter,

116
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,380
and,uh,I wondered whether she was...

117
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,570
shy and quiet,or was she more outgoing and made friends easily?

118
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,640
I mean,is this really important?

119
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,820
Yes,ma'am.I know that this is hard,but

120
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,310
the more similarities we can find between the victims,the more it'll help us narrow down who's responsible.

121
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,970
frank had a ball in her hand from the minute she could walk.

122
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,590
She was confident.

123
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,770
She knew everybody at school.

124
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,940
She thought of our oldest,patrick,as her best friend.

125
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,330
You know,she was like most girls her age.

126
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,980
She wanted everybody to like her.

127
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,840
Frank used to think that she was too much of a people pleaser,

128
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,900
but I think it shows a really good heart.

129
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,880
I do,too.

130
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,280
The police told us that they may have a-- they may have a witness who saw laura giving someone directions.

131
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,090
Does that sound like something she would have done?

132
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,690
We--we raised our children to be...

133
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:21,430
helpful and--and kind,and--and that made laura an easy target for a killer?

134
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,540
You have to know that you and frank did everything right.

135
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,600
Frank was supposed to be at work yesterday,and if laura-- if laura hadn't driven back to-- to campus that night,I mean,

136
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,480
this-- this wasn't supposed to happen.

137
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,640
This wasn't s--

138
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,580
Special agents gideon and morgan.

139
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,240
Detective robert portillo.

140
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,410
This is the fifth girl on my watch in the past 2 years,and we still don't have a viable suspect.

141
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,030
We think you're looking for 2 men.

142
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,450
Really?Based upon what evidence?

143
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,270
Well,given the level of sadistic torture and desire to document their crimes,

144
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,930
we're confident this was done by a killing team.

145
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,100
She's got deep lacerations on her neck,chest,and thighs.

146
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,760
From the color of the bruising,torture went on for several days.

147
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,410
Csi believes the cause of death was ligature strangulation,and it is consistent with the other victims.

148
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,860
In the video,she's wearing a pearl ring on her left hand.

149
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,640
No other evidence has turned up.

150
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,470
They've combed the area,quarter-mile radius.

151
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,660
Why would they need more trophies,gideon?

152
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,510
Maybe passed it along as a gift.

153
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,300
Like the green river killer?

154
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,500
Yeah.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,880
He'd leave jewelry for his female coworkers and then become aroused when he saw them wear it.

156
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,490
After everything they do to these girls,why do they leave 'em in these horrible positions?

157
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,690
Haven't they suffered enough?

158
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,500
Apparently not.

159
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,200
This is the ultimate degradation to the victim and her family.

160
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,990
Shock value for whoever finds them.

161
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,020
And it sends a message to the police.

162
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,040
What's that?

163
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,990
"Look what we can do.

164
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,350
You can't stop us.

165
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,790
" Are there new victims?

166
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,110
Garcia just sent a list over of all the unsolved rapes and murders in the past 3 years.

167
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,730
There are 2 that are particularly interesting.

168
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,860
They look the type.

169
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,870
Anything else?

170
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,400
Well,aside from sharing similar physical traits,they were also posed.

171
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,520
The only difference is they were manually strangled,which I think is why jacksonville P.D.Didn't find a connection.

172
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,500
We find dna on the first 2?

173
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,170
That's the thing.

174
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,580
It didn't match the recent kills,but check this out.

175
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,910
What if the dominant one allowed the submissive one to rape the first 2 victims in order to sort of draw him in,

176
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,770
and then once he's hooked,he began keeping the prize all for himself?

177
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,280
You tell morgan and gideon about this yet?

178
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,310
They're still at the crime scene.

179
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,960
We confirmed that laura clemensen had good relationships with her family and friends.

180
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,870
She got good grades and stayed out of trouble.

181
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,640
Just like all the other victims.

182
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,200
Did you guys notice that the package sent to the clemensen family was only sent to mary?

183
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,180
What about the first dvd?

184
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,490
Um,let me...

185
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,360
Why are they targeting the mothers?

186
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,990
The mother asked god to forgive the people responsible.

187
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,980
Hotch: And?

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,110
The family that received the first dvd went on tv pleading for their daughter's life.

189
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,660
That must have made the unsubs angry.

190
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,140
So sending the dvd to the mother is a message in itself.

191
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,070
A very clear one.

192
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,140
They don't want or need forgiveness.

193
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,690
How do you get to the freeway?

194
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,990
If you back out to warner and make a right,you'll see the exit in about half a mile.

195
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,950
Thanks.

196
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,560
No problem.

197
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,820
We're up to 7 victims now?

198
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,260
jacksonville police dept

199
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,050
The humiliating posing of the body can't be a coincidence.

200
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,040
It's just too unique.

201
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,860
The bruising on the necks.

202
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,500
Looks to me like the first victim struggled.

203
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,500
I'd say the killer probably lost his grip a couple times and really had to fight these women.

204
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,900
That's why he switched from bare hands to a ligature.

205
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,480
It's more efficient,controlled,and it doesn't sacrifice his sadistic need for a slow death.

206
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,040
Because the dna didn't match,jacksonville P.D.Just didn't put it together.

207
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,270
Yeah,and since the weren't looking for 2 offenders...

208
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,830
signature indicates these women had the same killers.

209
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,520
We just need to figure out who the hell they are.

210
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,340
Well,jacksonville P.D.Searched everywhere,even swamps,and still didn't find the victims' vehicles.

211
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,770
I got garcia tracing vins,but my guess is they dispose of the cars just like they do the women.

212
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,330
Yeah,but the bodies are easy to find.

213
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,770
Why do they go to so much trouble to hide the cars?

214
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,450
I didn't think it could get any hotter than yesterday.

215
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,710
Today's a record breaker,and the A.C.'S busted.Sorry about the fans.

216
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,520
They're probably spreading more dust than cool air.

217
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,450
Well,we won't keep your officers too long.

218
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:18,070
That's not to say that the submissive partner is in any way pure or innocent in this exchange.

219
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,020
If their criminal desire wasn't present,their partnership wouldn't work.

220
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,010
The offenders share a common delusion.

221
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,880
It's one that you and i would never accept,but it's this bond that justifies their actions.

222
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,710
So we're looking for 2 sick minds who complete each other.

223
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,540
It's kind of like the perfect storm.

224
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,560
Once these deviant personalities collide,they're deadly and unstoppable.

225
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,450
Like the D.C.Snipers or the columbine assassins.

226
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,860
Sometimes they've met in childhood.

227
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,820
Other times,they can be related,like the hillside stranglers,angelo buono and kenneth bianchi,

228
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,500
psychopathic cousins who terrorized women in los angeles.

229
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,400
The dominant partner makes the submissive one feel invincible.

230
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,630
That's his reward for doing as he's told.

231
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,670
Unfortunately there are countless opportunities for these twisted minds to meet,

232
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,210
and once they've pulled off their vicious acts,

233
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,240
the two accept this as common behavior and become bored with normal activity.

234
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,260
They live only for their new reality.

235
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,070
They're obsessed with it,addicted to it.

236
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,210
And there's a fierce loyalty between the two.

237
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,740
The submissive one,however,is usually less intelligent and easier to catch,and once caught,he is easier to turn.

238
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,910
Lack of remorse increas their aggressiveness.

239
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,570
Sexual sadists will stop when they're caught.

240
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,890
And the need to psychologically torture the families-- sorry to interrupt.

241
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:46,860
If you've seen my daughter,please,tiffany's all I have.

242
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,720
She--she went for a run last night,and she never came home.

243
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,140
She's my baby.

244
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,550
Why weren't we told about this before she went on the news?

245
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,160
'Cause we didn't know about it.

246
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,080
Tiffany was abducted from middleberg.

247
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,250
That's nearly an hour away,and it's outside of jacksonville's jurisdiction.

248
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,100
Are you sure these are the same offenders?

249
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,930
Well,she's their type.

250
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,590
Grabbed her while jogging,just like their third victim.

251
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,360
Middleberg's only an hour from here?

252
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,390
If they see this,it's just a matter of time before they send a dvd.

253
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,930
All right,jennifer jareau,fbi.

254
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,370
You just aired a press conference with beverly spears.

255
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,340
I need to speak to her immediately.

256
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,830
These guys are impatient.

257
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,740
They just dumped laura clemensen's body 24 hours ago.

258
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,570
Which means they're more dangerous than they were yesterday,and tiffany spears is running out of time.

259
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,650
You ok?

260
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,650
Am I ok?

261
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,520
Uh,let me see.

262
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:44,280
I've got images of a girl being tortured burned inside my brain over the strains of this once-carefree choice of music.

263
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,320
I've isolated 4 sources from one track,and each one is more distorted than the next,

264
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,250
so no,I am not ok,and it's gonna take awhile.

265
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,910
Penelope,you know I appreciate you doing this.

266
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,990
Thank you,sugar.

267
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,230
For right now,even that doesn't feel good.

268
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,800
Eh,moving on.

269
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,940
Some of these victims were abducted while driving.

270
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,780
It does leave a nice trail,especially when all the parts lead you to trevor's used auto in georgia.

271
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,790
Well,no wonder jacksonville P.D.Couldn't find the vehicles.

272
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,360
The unsubs didn't drive the cars.

273
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,830
They destroyed them and sold the parts.

274
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,510
Yeah,and over state lines.

275
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,560
These sickos are good.

276
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,300
Parts were found in georgia.

277
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,260
Sales were traced to a joey davin,who lives right here in jacksonville.Joseph P.

278
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,130
Davin,27.

279
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,900
In and out of jail since he was 17.

280
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,920
Number of charges,including car theft with a partner.

281
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,180
Maybe he likes to team up.

282
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,310
Either way,he hasn't learned his lesson.

283
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,700
Doesn't sound too smart to me.

284
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,330
Exactly why he needs a good leader.

285
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,760
If it is proof that tiffany is still alive,still breathing,I need to see it.

286
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,980
Ma'am,you don't understand.

287
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,660
Do you remember what tiffany was wearing the last time you saw her?

288
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,520
I told the police she was going for a run.

289
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,240
Sneakers,tank,shorts.

290
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,710
Well,you need to think of her like this until we get her back.

291
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,690
You don't need to see what's on that dvd.

292
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,320
I was supposed to have run with her yesterday.

293
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,520
I should have been there.

294
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,220
Help her,please,god.

295
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,090
Help her.

296
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:40,720
Investigators are connecting tiffany spears' disappearance with those of the 5 other victims murdered in the jacksonville area,

297
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,060
including laura clemensen,whose body was found yesterday.

298
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,650
3 of the victims' cars are still missing.

299
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:53,280
Investigators believe if they can find who took those cars,they will find the killer responsible.

300
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,630
Fbi.

301
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
And what can I do for you?

302
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,300
We're looking for joseph davin.

303
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,250
What did joey do now?

304
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,290
Sir,we really need to talk to joey.

305
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,740
You joseph davin?

306
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,340
Get out of my way.

307
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,980
Joey,don't be stupid!

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,790
I saw it on tv.3 strikes,and I'm out.

309
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm not goin' back.

310
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,350
I'm n--I'm not goin' down for this.

311
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,910
Put the weapon down.

312
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,340
Put it down now!

313
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,940
Joey,put--

314
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,250
Oh,joey!

315
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,680
Why didn't he put down the gun?

316
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,870
He didn't want that third strike.

317
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,990
I didn't have a choice.

318
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,070
And he was our closest link to finding tiffany spears.

319
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,630
Can't this wait?

320
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,750
Mr.Davin,there have been 7 women raped and murdered in the jacksonville area.

321
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,300
We can tie joe to 3 of them.

322
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,930
You know,I thought by forcing him to move back in here,it would keep him out of trouble.

323
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,640
How long had your son been living here?

324
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,560
2 years.

325
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,830
After the M.S.Put me in the chair.

326
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,770
Was he still running with his boys from prison?

327
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,240
Aw,he works at a garage with a bunch of ex-cons.

328
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,190
I tried so hard.

329
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,630
I just couldn't get him out of that world.

330
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,960
I kept telling him,"you're better than all this.

331
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,750
" Agent gideon,we just found this.

332
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,990
Your son have a friend or girlfriend with long,blond hair?

333
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,110
Not that I know of,no.

334
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,370
Is it possible that you wouldn't know if you did?

335
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,380
After today...

336
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,750
nothing would surprise me.

337
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,960
Morgan: The dominant one wouldn't have panicked like that.

338
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,170
He would have come at us shooting and gone down in a blaze of glory.

339
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,910
So where's the other half of this partnership?

340
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,700
Witnesses saw a white minivan,correct?

341
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,700
Morgan: That one's henry'S.

342
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,800
It's got handicapped plates.

343
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,130
You see any signs in henry's behavior that he could be part of this?

344
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,880
Nah.

345
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,840
But if joey drives the van,then he can drive while his partner snatches the girls.

346
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,200
Have your men process the van.

347
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,830
If there's anything in there that doesn't belong to joe or henry davin,I wanna know about it.

348
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,020
So,how does joe meet his partner?

349
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,510
Well,his father says he hangs with a bunch of ex-cons at the garage.

350
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,570
Yeah.It's,uh-- it's in springfield.

351
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,640
I'll have hotch check it out.

352
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,410
If he's still hanging with ex-cons,he probably talks to his old cellmate.

353
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,780
Find out who that is.

354
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,720
Ok.

355
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,710
This better be hella good.

356
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,730
Garcia?

357
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,940
Hello.

358
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,700
Yes,sir.

359
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,780
I'm here.I'm sorry.

360
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,020
I just--I wasn't--I'm surprised that you're calling me.

361
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,540
I need to know who joseph davin shared a cell with.

362
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,390
Yes.Sure.

363
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,720
Uh,it was a guy...

364
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,480
named...

365
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,350
His name was tony canardo.

366
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,970
They were in together for 18 months,and both were released 3 years ago.

367
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,130
Before the killings started.

368
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,110
Is that it?

369
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,840
His current address is 865 kentwood in jacksonville.

370
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,940
That's all you got?

371
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,570
Uh,yeah.

372
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,520
Garcia...

373
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,740
yes.

374
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,380
You do great work.

375
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,750
Keep it up.

376
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,090
Oh,thank you,sir.

377
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,740
Thank you.

378
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,540
Man: Look,I got 2 guys out today.

379
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,300
I can't help you.

380
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,680
But my car's still leaking oil.

381
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,730
Do you still have a receipt?

382
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,800
It was less than a month ago.

383
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,790
Do you have your receipt?

384
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,990
Hotch: Excuse me.

385
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm with a customer.

386
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,270
All right.

387
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,650
What can you tell me about joe davin?

388
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,560
I can tell you i fired him last week.

389
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,070
Why?

390
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,380
He wasn't very good at his job.

391
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,430
He was shot this morning by jacksonville police.

392
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,630
Sorry to hear that.

393
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,270
You seem real upset by the news.

394
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,640
I already had another guy to take his place.

395
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,310
Well,you didn't waste any time,did you?

396
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,290
His ex-con buddies were always at the shop.

397
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,360
It's bad for business.

398
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,360
You're an ex-con.

399
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,230
I was innocent.

400
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,990
Yeah.They all are.

401
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,940
You know this guy?

402
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,790
That's t-bone.

403
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,600
Name's tony canardo.

404
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,510
He ran with joey's crowd.

405
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,820
This is one of the ex-cons that you were talking about?

406
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,740
Yeah.

407
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,310
When tony's around,joey's not taking orders from me,and I can't have too many cooks in the kitchen.

408
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,940
You know what I mean?

409
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,420
We do.

410
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,860
Look,I gotta get back to work.

411
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,620
Well,joey was just surrounded by dominant personalities.

412
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,000
If mike kroger was the killer,you'd think he'd try to hide it better.

413
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,290
We'll have garcia run his sheet.

414
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,580
Who are you guys?

415
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,890
MrS.Canardo.

416
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,670
Can we come in?

417
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,730
Everything ok?

418
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,000
Uh,you tell me.

419
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,300
We're looking for your husband.

420
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,780
He's not home.

421
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,970
Well,he spent time in prison with a man named joseph davin.

422
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,080
Do you know him?

423
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,840
Yeah,I know joey.

424
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,770
Joey's dead.

425
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,960
Oh,my god.What happened?

426
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,770
He pulled a gun when we were trying to question him.

427
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,700
About what?

428
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,490
7 young women in the jacksonville area who've been raped and killed.

429
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,370
Did you know him well?

430
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,200
He and my husband did time together.

431
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:43,340
When tony got out on good behavior,he tried to turn his life around,stay clean.

432
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,510
How's he doing?

433
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,300
Ok.

434
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,750
Some of those are mine.

435
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,440
Tony ever get into trouble or do anything that scares you when he drinks?

436
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,040
Only when he's around joey.

437
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,460
Those two get together,I'm afraid of what could happen.

438
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,540
Do you know where we can find tony now?

439
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,010
He's getting off work.

440
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,410
He should be home soon.

441
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,760
Is there anyplace you can go?

442
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,250
'Cause we're gonna need to talk to him.

443
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,930
I can call my friend kim.

444
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,880
You wanna drive me down to the station?

445
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,830
Can you wait here for tony?

446
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,030
Did you run mike kroger's sheet,the guy from the garage?

447
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,650
The boy needs a refresher course in anger management.

448
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,140
Ok,we got assault and battery.

449
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,530
We got assault with a deadly weapon.

450
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,030
There's one attempted rape,but it was dropped,because the poor thing was too scared to testify against mr.Stinky.

451
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,120
Where was he when tiffany spears was abducted?

452
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,960
His credit card says miami,but not all of his alibis check out,

453
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,950
and you know if there is one loose thread,I will find it,I will pull it,and his story will completely unravel.

454
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,610
A tout alors.

455
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,530
Uh,garcia's checking mike kroger's whereabouts when the women were abducted.

456
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,340
Some of his alibis already check out.

457
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,880
What about tony canardo?

458
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,110
Morgan's still outside his house waiting.

459
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,030
Officer: Excuse me.

460
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,970
Agent gideon,there's someone here who wants to talk to you.

461
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,840
Mrs.Canardo.

462
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,910
What happened?

463
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,370
After you left,I got nervous,so I went to find tony.

464
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,440
Please,sit down.

465
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,660
And he--he knew something was up,so...

466
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,790
you got a kleenex?

467
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,300
What'd you tell him?

468
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,200
Well,I told him the truth,that the fbi was asking questions.

469
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,850
So he hit you?

470
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,230
I wasn't completely honest with you about tony.

471
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,100
He fell off the wagon a while ago.

472
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,410
I just was afraid to say something.

473
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,160
I didn't wanna betray him.He's my husband.

474
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,960
No,it's--it's good that you're here with us.

475
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,760
You're safe here.

476
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,590
I'm gonna go tell portillo and hotch that they should meet morgan.

477
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,490
Uh,ms.Canardo,can i ask you a question?

478
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,720
Yes.

479
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,310
Uh,is that ring new?

480
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,090
Tony won some money playing poker.

481
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,360
He bought it as a gift.

482
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,060
Why?

483
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,870
Looks a lot like laura clemensen'S.

484
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,100
Big mistake.

485
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,550
Come on!

486
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,180
Morgan!
Yeah!Right here!

487
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,800
What,you couldn't wait?

488
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,680
I didn't want him to get away.

489
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,250
You all right?
Yeah.I'm fine.

490
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,350
Say anything?

491
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,500
No.

492
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,270
You should have stuck to beating up girls.

493
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,770
Bring him inside.

494
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,840
Thank you.

495
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,050
The tapes are sitting right out.

496
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,930
We were never in this room.We never saw them.

497
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,040
it's tiffany spears.

498
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,230
where is she?

499
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,940
Help!

500
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,250
Please,help!

501
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,680
Help me!

502
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,320
Help!

503
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,570
Help.

504
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,900
If we're gonna get anything out of tony,we gotta praise him.

505
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,610
He's the dominant.He thinks he deserves it.

506
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,290
Confirm instead of undermine his expectations.

507
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,990
Make him think he's smarter than us because he saw it coming.

508
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,790
We don't have much time.

509
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,900
I know.I'm sorry.That's just standard procedure.

510
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,250
I'm special agent aaron hotchner.

511
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,510
I'm supervising this task force.

512
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,370
I just wanna say that this case,your case,is,uh...

513
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,670
remarkable.

514
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,860
You've got people at the B.A.U.Shaking their heads.

515
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,310
Tony: What about you?

516
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,620
You shaking your head?

517
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,500
Absolutely.

518
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,940
7 victims in 3 years.

519
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,160
You've got every woman in jacksonville living in fear.

520
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,420
That's pretty much what you wanted,isn't it?

521
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,290
Well,I'm sure whoever's responsible for it is enjoying it.

522
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,890
The B.A.U.Would like to show your interview,with your permission,of course.

523
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,610
Show me what's in the boxes.

524
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,280
This.

525
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,040
They're all full.

526
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,870
It's all you.

527
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,220
We can,uh--we can open all the boxes if you want.

528
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,790
No.

529
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,690
I wanna see my lawyer.

530
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,460
Well,tony sure lawyered up quick.

531
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,000
He's playing games.

532
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,780
Deal if you tell us where tiffany spears is.

533
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,820
This guy's been to jail before.

534
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,990
He knows how to keep his mouth shut.

535
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,630
What do you think,I'm stupid?

536
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,480
Far from it.

537
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,970
Morgan: Look at that.

538
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,920
Notice how he's focused on those 2 pictures.

539
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,190
We can't forensically tie him to those victims,but we're certain that he posed those bodies after death.

540
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,800
Well,that's certainly not working.

541
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,070
I'm not getting anywhere with him.

542
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,420
Is the wife still here?

543
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,030
We wanna put her in a room with him?

544
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,220
We need to humanize him.

545
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,620
I think she could do that.

546
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,060
How he abuses her.

547
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,490
And she takes it.

548
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,130
She's subservient to him.

549
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,770
You think she'd do it?

550
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,930
If we wanna find tiffany spears,she'll have to.

551
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,550
It's worth a shot.

552
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,220
We'd been together 2 years,and we were gonna start a family.

553
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,910
Sorry to interrupt.

554
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,230
Few minuteS.Thank you.

555
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,270
How you holdin' up?

556
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,830
Ok,I guess.

557
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,490
You called your family?

558
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,730
Tony's my only family.

559
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,640
Tony won't talk to us.

560
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,120
What are you gonna do?

561
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,120
I think if you go in there,he'll talk to you.

562
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,300
You want me to go in a room with him?

563
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,780
I can't do that.

564
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,580
There--you gotta find another way.

565
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,770
He'll kill me.I turned him in.

566
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,140
Look what he did to me.

567
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,910
I know.

568
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,310
I believe...

569
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,930
That you're the only person who can get through to tony.

570
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,280
With joe dead,tony's the only one who knows where tiffany spears is.

571
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:02,470
And if he tells you,you've saved her life.

572
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,260
Right now,you're her only hope.

573
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,710
Honey,I need to know where...

574
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,640
where the girl is.

575
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,210
Don't you mean...

576
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,640
they need to know?

577
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,030
Why should i tell them anything?

578
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,410
What have I got to gain?

579
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,110
They're pinning us for 7 murders,amber.

580
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,000
I can't believe you and joey killed them all.

581
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,950
7!

582
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,640
None of this would have happened if joey had stayed away.

583
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,490
We were on our way to better things.

584
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,220
Joey messed that up for us.

585
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,380
I need you to tell me,tony.

586
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,690
Where'd joey take the girl?

587
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,790
I can'T.

588
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,100
I'm begging you to end this.

589
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,900
Tell me now.

590
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,400
Where's the girl?

591
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,110
There's this...

592
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,620
storage unit.

593
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,570
Joe's dad is the only one who has the key.

594
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,880
I can't believe my husband killed all those women.

595
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,250
It took a lot of courage to go in there.

596
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,550
You did the right thing.

597
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,240
Can we get you a glass of water or something?

598
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,070
Yeah.

599
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:32,670
Water?

600
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,730
Yeah.

601
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,410
You stay with her,please?

602
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,570
Yes,sir.

603
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,550
Joe's dad?Isn't he in a wheelchair,though?

604
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,840
Only for the last 2 years.

605
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,040
Henry davin could have raped and killed the first 2 women 3 years ago,then brought in joe and tony to continue his work.

606
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,690
Maybe it's the only satisfaction he can get.

607
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,430
Now they record it,and he lives it though them.

608
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,060
So it was a team of 3.

609
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,600
We found laura clemensen's hair at henry's house.It makes sense.

610
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,250
Let's take a ride.

611
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,240
Tony canardo's one sick bastard.

612
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,660
I'm not surprised mother abandoned him when he was 4,

613
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,670
and then she got clean and got him back until he was 11,when she got busted for prostitution.

614
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,140
No wonder he hates women.

615
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,730
He bounced around social services after that.

616
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,310
I mean,this guy never had any support,no foundation,no security.

617
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,490
How'd he get the confidence to pull off something like that?

618
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,580
Maybe that's why he needed a partner.

619
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,520
But he's supposed to be the dominant one,the leader.

620
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,130
I mean,given his history...

621
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,420
how can he do that?

622
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,380
She's not here.

623
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,760
She was never here.

624
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,520
What the hell's going on?

625
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,080
This looks nothing like the video.

626
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,690
Reid: He's really playing a tough guy with that officer,huh?

627
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,930
He played the tough guy with hotch.

628
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,460
It wasn't antagonistic.It was defensive.

629
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,090
False bravado?

630
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,340
You think he's wearing a mask?

631
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,110
Let me see amber's tape.

632
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,740
Why isn't she scared?

633
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,470
She looks scared to me.

634
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,480
No.

635
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,860
Look.

636
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,130
She initiated eye contact right there.

637
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,780
Yeah?

638
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,090
You guys have gotta hear this.

639
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,440
Patch it through.

640
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,040
If she were afraid,she'd look anywhere but his face.

641
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,550
She's looking at the victims,and she doesn't really...

642
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,720
she doesn't seem that repulsed.

643
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,740
She actually looks surprisingly calm.

644
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,200
Amber: Now put that little bitch on her side.

645
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,260
You like it,don't you?

646
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,530
Dirty whore likes it.

647
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,510
He's studying her.

648
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,680
He's waiting for her lead.

649
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,710
Where'd joey take the girl?

650
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,260
She just gave him an order.

651
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,730
He's protecting her.

652
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,900
He's giving her an out.

653
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,920
Amber: Do it again.

654
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,200
Gideon: Where is she?

655
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,330
Where's the girl?!

656
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,850
Where is she?!

657
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,510
Told you to watch her.

658
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,410
We analyzed what we recorded of tony and amber.

659
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,970
Turns out she's the dominant one.

660
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,380
Garcia finally isolated the soundtrack on that dvd.

661
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,170
Turns out it was amber giving the orders.

662
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,700
That means she's the one doing the killing.

663
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,840
Where is amber now?

664
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,630
She told the cop she was going out for a smoke and walked out the back door.

665
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,530
We're running out of time.

666
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,480
You've gotta find out where they're holding tiffany.

667
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,440
I'll change the approach.

668
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,700
Uh,you're gonna wanna look at this.

669
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,920
Joey davin's dna didn't match the first 2 victims.

670
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,380
That means neither could henry'S.

671
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,670
So who raped the first 2 girls?

672
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,490
Lucky man,you know that?

673
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,960
You have something really special.

674
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:00,730
I mean,she had to know what you were doing to all those women and stayed with you anyway.

675
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,240
Must feel great to be appreciated by the woman you love.

676
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,840
It does.
I bet.

677
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,010
I know you and amber would do anything for each other.

678
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:20,160
But why would you confess to killing these 2 women when you had no idea who they are?

679
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,740
Joey and i killed all of 'em.

680
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,220
Really?

681
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,320
Well,whose dna did we find at the scene?

682
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,380
What are you talking about?

683
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,710
Well,it's not yours.It's not joe'S.

684
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,150
That poor guy probably had no idea these cars belonged to the women you killed.

685
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,360
Makes you wonder if you and joe hadn't shared a cell together,maybe he'd still be alive.

686
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,390
You got the wrong idea.

687
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,420
No,I think you've got the wrong idea,tony.

688
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,390
Joe wasn't your partner.

689
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,130
Tiffany spears isn't at the storage unit.

690
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,890
You wanna know what else?

691
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,000
We can hear amber's voice on the videos telling you what to do.

692
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,270
We know amber's your partner.

693
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,420
Come on.

694
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,580
Why?

695
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,210
Why you protecting her?

696
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,160
She's  wife.

697
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,710
It's more than that.

698
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:12,830
Look,nothing would ever come between us-- not you...

699
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,020
not nothing.

700
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,080
Besides amber would never do anything to hurt me.

701
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,860
Reid here.

702
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,810
No time for pleasantries.

703
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,710
I was able to unseal a file regarding amber canardo.

704
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,680
What does it say?

705
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:27,280
When amber was 15,she walked into a tallahassee hospital raped and beaten something awful.

706
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,440
Doctors deduced she was being abused by her father and her brother.

707
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,150
Eventually they convinced her to go to the police.

708
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,850
But when she did,mom showed up and told them that amber was lying.

709
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,300
She obviously did nothing to protect amber from the abuse.

710
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:45,190
She--she feels betrayed by her mother and now receives extreme sadistic pleasure in watching the same thing that happened to her.

711
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,810
Strange.In this case the abused actually became the abuser.

712
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,910
That doesn't happen a lot?

713
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,620
1 in 8.

714
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,590
We found the one.

715
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,510
You ask amber how the first 2 women died?

716
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,360
She's done it before,tony.

717
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,000
No,she hasn'T.

718
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,160
Yes,she has,with other men.

719
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,240
You're not so special.

720
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,210
Men mean nothing to her.

721
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,200
She used you,just like the other guy.

722
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,800
Shut up.

723
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,250
She set you up,tony.

724
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,900
She had you do everything.

725
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:27,620
Whose dna do you think that was at the scene?

726
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,980
Come on.Think about it.

727
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,280
Amber beat herself up,she walked in here,she handed me laura clemensen's ring,

728
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,570
and she told us you gave it to her as a gift.

729
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,930
You know it's true,and that's why you're upset.

730
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,370
Gideon,garcia found out that amber was abused by her brother and her father.

731
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,230
They'd take her to the woods.

732
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,540
She betrayed you,tony.

733
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,310
There's only one way to get her back.

734
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,480
Because if you don't,she'll forget about you,just like this other guy.

735
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,370
Tell us where she's keeping the girl.

736
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:09,270
I know amber's father kept her in the woods so no one would hear her scream.

737
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,500
Was it amber's idea to leave the girls in the woods?

738
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,740
Where's tiffany?

739
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,760
There's a cabin.

740
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,680
duval county woods

741
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,890
Go!

742
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,190
Fbi!

743
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,010
Back off!

744
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,520
Amber: You got nothin' on me.

745
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,480
Yeah,we just got your voice on the tapes giving the orders.

746
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,290
So what?

747
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,000
He saved one little whore.

748
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,070
Tiffany,I'm fbi.

749
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,650
I'm not gonna hurt you.

750
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,160
Look at me.

751
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,650
She'll never be the same.

752
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,810
Morgan: You're ok.

753
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,970
You're ok.

754
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,050
We got amber.

755
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,750
Tiffany spears is alive.

756
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,400
All right.Thank you.

757
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,850
Jacksonville P.D.Found the remains of a body on the grounds of the cabin.

758
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,450
They think it's amber canardo's old boyfriend.

759
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,090
And 10'll get 20 that dna'll match the first 2 victims.

760
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,350
At least the families will finally have closure.

761
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,540
And we did save tiffany spears.

762
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:31,310
