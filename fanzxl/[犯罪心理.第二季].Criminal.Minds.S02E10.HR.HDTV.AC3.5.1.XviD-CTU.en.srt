1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,010
go,go,go,go!

2
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,290
Clear. Clear.

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,590
We clear here .

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,110
Surveillance had them all 
going inside 45 minutes ago.

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,880
Did anyone bail out 
on the perimeter?

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,040
No,ma'am. All secure out here.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,460
Boss,this isn't a meth lab.

8
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,610
So why an escape tunnel?

9
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,350
Need to take a look at this.

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,570
Hotchner.

11
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,200
When?

12
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,020
Did they raise the terror alert?

13
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,580
No,that's probably best.

14
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,100
All right,get everybody in now.

15
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,530
I'll be there in a minute.

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,150
What's going on?

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,560
Nothing. I just have 
to go to the office.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,800
It's 6:15,and you're talking 
about a terror alert?

19
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,890
It's bad,isn't it?

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,480
I don't know yet.

21
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,370
Please don't lie to me.

22
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,010
It might be.

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,700
I may not be home tonight.

24
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,860
I mean,I might be home late.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,550
I know.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,970
Shoot. I forgot.

27
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,580
Tomorrow is the day we scheduled to 
take jack to have his pictures taken.

28
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,190
Don't worry about it. 
I'll reschedule.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,280
No,no,no,no. Go 
ahead and take him,

30
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,150
and I'll do my best 
to be there,ok?

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,130
Just come back safely.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,580
I will.

33
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,640
Bye.

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,330
Everybody,meet agent prentiss.

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,160
you had a date. I've been 
filling her in on protocol.

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,220
- Derek morgan.  
- Emily prentiss.

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,550
We can make nice later. 
What do we know?

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,130
The dea raided what they thought was a hardened 
meth lab right here in northern virginia,

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,160
but they found this instead.

40
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,520
That could be a dispersal 
device for a chemical weapon.

41
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,410
Sophisticated.

42
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,360
Homeland security's thinking al qaeda.

43
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,110
They've developed devices that span 
the spectrum of sophistication,

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,550
some as simple as soda 
bottles and paint cans.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,320
They're called al ikhteraa.

46
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,080
- Literally "the invention."  
- They are.

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,020
Do we know what the biological 
or chemical agent is yet?

48
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,590
No,not yet.

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,210
The cell members bailed 
out through a tunnel.

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,830
The dea recovered a nextel 2-way 
and managed to intercept a message.

51
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,440
That's not the transcript. 
No,it's in arabic.

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,220
our friends surprised 
us and eloped.

53
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,960
We can no longer wait for 
the wedding as planned.

54
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,280
We can deliver our gift 
at the next crescent.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,510
I lived in several middle 
eastern countries growing up.

56
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,770
Next crescent?

57
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,250
Muslims sometimes 
use a lunar calendar.

58
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,110
- I'd have to look it up...   
- next crescent moon is in 2 days.

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,020
So whatever they're attacking,it's 
happening in less than 48 hours.

60
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,270
It sounds like it,sir.

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,680
Payment for the nextel 
is linked to this man.

62
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,780
Jind allah.

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,000
Literally soldier of god.

64
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,110
That's pretty poor operational 
security for a sophisticated plot.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,500
2 months ago,jind allah was 
captured leaving the U.S.

66
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,460
Using a forged pakistani passport 
via richmond international airport.

67
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,360
He's been held as a ghost detainee 
in guantanamo bay ever since.

68
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,850
So technically,he doesn't exist.

69
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,950
Soldier of god isn't a name.

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,350
No,it's most likely a name taken 
on for the jihad,meaning struggle.

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,650
Extremists claim it's a holy war.

72
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,570
Yet the words "holy" and "war" 
never appear together in the qu'ran.

73
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,790
Do we know his real name?

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,390
Cia interrogators have gotten 
nothing out of the guy.

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,810
They need us to break him.

76
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,830
We do know from past intercepts 
that he's a recruiter.

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,150
He came into this country 
to assemble the omega cell,

78
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,000
a sleeper cell with 
an unknown mission.

79
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,480
We have 48 hours to do what the cia 
hasn't been able to manage in 2 months.

80
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,910
We could be looking at the first 
attack on our soil since 9/11.

81
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,040
Hey. Car here? I told 
reid 5 minutes.

82
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,970
I think you should take 
prentiss with you to guantanamo.

83
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,620
Excuse me? 
She could be of help.

84
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,690
I don't know enough 
about her abilities.

85
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,060
There's plenty for 
her to do back here.

86
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,910
I don't know what she's capable of either,
but we've got to find out sooner or later.

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,020
Well,it's an interrogation,
not a training exercise.

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,230
She's the only member of 
the team fluent in arabic.

89
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,340
Well,there are other translators.

90
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,890
Yeah,but they haven't 
studied behavior.

91
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,630
She ever have her ready bag yet?

92
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,960
My guess is there isn't much 
this woman's unprepared for.

93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,190
Car leaves in 4 minutes.

94
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,620
Yes,sir.

95
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,440
The old term used,

96
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,800
some of the best lessons are 
learned from past mistakes.

97
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,810
The error of the past is 
the wisdom of the future.

98
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,770
Excuse me,sir.

99
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,100
I just wanted to let you 
know how much I appreciate--

100
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,010
do not thank me.

101
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,180
- Sir?  
- It's not a favor.

102
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,350
Of course. I know that.

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,680
You're coming to do a job.

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,250
Do you think the interrogation 
of jind allah will work in time?

105
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,110
Interrogation's the most 
dynamic form of profiling.

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,630
That's not an answer.

107
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,860
Sir.

108
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,060
He's been locked away in gtmo.

109
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,830
He doesn't know we raided 
the cell's safe house.

110
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,420
That's an advantage for us.

111
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,220
The main thing is to get 
him talking about anything.

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,610
Then his language and body 
movements will betray him.

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,630
It's like this-- you just focus on 
the way your opponent holds his piece.

114
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,120
How quickly and firmly he places it. 
Then you watch his face and body.

115
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,630
It'll telegraph a player's 
strategy,his training,

116
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,010
maybe his motivations.

117
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,530
Is that what you need us to do?

118
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,580
No. I need you to listen.

119
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,140
You're fluent in arabic.

120
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,190
I won't know the 
nuances like you.

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,210
Every word,every phrase.

122
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,710
Be on the lookout for 
subtext,ulterior meanings.

123
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,310
What do you want me to do?

124
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,530
I want you to watch for tells.

125
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,840
Non-verbals,micro-expressions.

126
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,940
Watch him when he's 
comfortable and relaxed,

127
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,870
then note the behavioral changes 
when he's under stress.

128
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,790
If we can establish a baseline,we'll be able 
to read him once I challenge his belief systems.

129
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,880
Before I can get him to give 
up where or how they'll attack,

130
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,210
I'll first have to cause him 
to reveal something of himself.

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,490
Game oveR.

132
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,590
What are you talking about?

133
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,510
Gtmo's runway is perpendicular 
to cuban airspace,

134
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,730
so approaching aircraft have to negotiate a last 
minute 90 degree right turn in order to land.

135
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,310
They call it the gtmo twist.

136
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,260
I was winning.

137
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,730
Actually,he would 
have had you in 3.

138
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,550
- Bonnie ryan.  
- Aaron hotchner.

139
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,370
Dea team. We ran this raid.

140
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,780
Derek morgan.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,770
This must have slowed 
you down some,huh?

142
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,180
Enough for them to get 
out through the tunnel.

143
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,320
They must have done escape drills.

144
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,780
Hey,morgan.

145
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,490
Hey,kenny. Been a minute,man.

146
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,680
Yeah.

147
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,270
- We good in here?   
- Yeah,

148
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,590
don't worry about it. 
Everything's been rendered safe.

149
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,130
These guys weren't 
messing around.

150
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,190
Hotch,these tubes surround what 
would be the explosive charge.

151
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,240
And this cylinder right here?

152
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,250
It's gotta be where they put whatever 
bio or chem agent they plan on dispersing.

153
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,570
That's happy thought.

154
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,470
Yeah. Tell me about it.

155
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,150
Looks like a 4 man cell.

156
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,560
They assimilated 
into the community.

157
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,830
Just like any other suburban gangster 
wannabes rolling at the mall.

158
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,340
Who do you think we're dealing with?

159
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,260
Most likely middle eastern males 
in their early twenties.

160
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,260
And judging by that device out there,
they're looking at significant targets:

161
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,960
Military installations,
government buildings.

162
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,630
You must be the bau boys.

163
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,740
And gal. Pardon me.

164
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,330
- I'm jason gideon.  
- Andy bingaman,fbi.

165
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,110
Agent prentiss,dr. Reid.

166
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,300
I'm the intelligence 
supervisor here at gtmo.

167
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,460
You guys having a hard time 
getting jind allah to talk?

168
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,110
Not only can't they get him 
to budge,but 2 weeks ago,

169
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,230
word got out that one of the other 
detainees was spilling secrets.

170
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,610
Jind allah managed to have a 3 minute 
conversation with him in the shower line.

171
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,690
That night,the other 
detainee committed suicide.

172
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,320
He's reciting the 
qu'ran from memory.

173
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,960
He's most likely a hafez.

174
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,500
He must have done it a dozen times 
since he's come to this facility.

175
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,850
Some muslim children are 
able to do it since age 12.

176
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,530
2 months of interrogation,that's all the 
cia's been able to get out of him.

177
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,430
There are cuts and bruises 
under his right eye socket.

178
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,070
What kind of tactics are they using?

179
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,000
I control the actions 
to the detainees,

180
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,050
but I can assure you,my protest 
about their methods has been ignored.

181
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,430
Let the interrogation 
proceed normally.

182
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm gonna interrupt and 
demand they stop harassing.

183
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,480
Maybe I should tell 
them in advance.

184
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,180
No,it's better if 
they don't expect it.

185
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,260
The reaction will be more 
visceral,more believable.

186
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,000
- Go ahead with phase 2 as planned.  
- Got you

187
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,360
You really gonna put a 
show on for these guys?

188
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,330
No,no for them.

189
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,460
For jind allah.

190
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,150
He's needs to see me as a complete contrast 
to what he's come to expect from his captors.

191
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,700
It's the best way to jump 
start him into talking.

192
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,850
We have less than 36 hours.

193
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,500
Have at it.

194
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,670
You 2 ready?

195
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,040
- Yeah,this way.  
- Thank you.

196
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,680
Do you understand?

197
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,310
Every day--

198
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,120
who the hell are you?

199
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,480
Supervisory special 
agent jason gideon.

200
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,420
I'm an fbi behavioral analyst.

201
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,740
It's time to show this 
man some respect.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,380
You gotta be kidding me.

203
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,700
You have orders from 
agent bingaman to leave

204
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,220
so I can speak with 
this detainee alone.

205
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,140
I'm sorry for the 
treatmentyou've suffered.

206
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,630
If you don't mind,I'd like to 
spend some time with you.

207
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,700
He stopped his recitation.

208
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,110
He's sizing gideon up.

209
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,290
If I don't mind?

210
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,300
Like to get to know you as a person.

211
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,210
Your faith,your ideology.

212
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,540
To what end?

213
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,110
Studying human 
behavior is what I do.

214
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,090
You know,if these guys 
are fundamentalists,

215
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,320
you'd think they'd have 
qu'rans,prayer mats.

216
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,370
No. We didn't find 
any of that here.

217
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,220
They must have at least 
one other location.

218
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,480
Ryan,

219
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,220
hotch.  what is it ?

220
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,580
That looks like a 
list of chemicals.

221
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,670
I'm gonna check with garcia.

222
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,870
Go,doll.

223
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,620
Hey,I'm gonna read off a 
list to you. it's criminals

224
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,490
I'd like to believe,with 
greater understanding one day,

225
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,960
we can come to a peaceful 
resolution of our differences.

226
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,630
Is that so?

227
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,520
Look,I don't know what you've done 
or what you may have planned to do.

228
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,520
But unlike the other detainees here,

229
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,830
you have the education,intelligence
to convey the nuances of your culture.

230
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,750
That's what interests me.

231
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,590
Until I don't give you what you want.

232
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,650
Then you will resort to other tactics.

233
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,910
I swore an oath to uphold 
the united states constitution,

234
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,680
no matter where I am,no 
matter who I deal with.

235
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,190
You're sure?

236
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,080
All right.

237
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,240
What'd she say?

238
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,250
Garcia says this looks like a list of 
additives needed to weaponize anthrax.

239
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,080
could they get enough anthrax?

240
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,560
The letter sent to senator tom daschle's office 
in 2002 only contained 2 grams of purified spores,

241
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,240
enough to kill 25 million people 
if effectively distributed.

242
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,390
Are you willing to have a chat with me?

243
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,950
Go ahead. Good.

244
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,970
Let's chat.

245
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,280
He's from egypt. Cairo.

246
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,120
You sure?

247
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,300
No,he could be yemeni,but 
odds are he's egyptian.

248
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,500
What type of name is gideon?

249
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,730
American.

250
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,210
I often forget that in your country you 
put your country first and your god last.

251
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,230
Sir,he was born and raised in egypt.

252
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,530
They pronouce "j" sounds as a "G."

253
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,420
You don't consider yourself 
egyptian as well as muslim?

254
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,650
Egyptian.

255
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:05,000
In 2 minutes,you know more about me 
than those thugs found out in 2 months.

256
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,330
They and I have very,very different 
motives and methodologies.

257
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,680
And yet your country relies 
on them to protect you from us.

258
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,680
Sometimes they're 
their own worst enemy.

259
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,290
Yeah. Who is your worst 
enemy,agent gideon?

260
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,360
It's not a who.

261
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,050
It's a what.

262
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,680
Ignorance.

263
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,450
You're a very honest man.

264
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,320
And you?

265
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,020
Must have become a hafez by what,age 10?

266
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,100
9.

267
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,580
Any person with the discipline and dedication 
to memorize the entire qu'ran by age 9

268
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,230
must have a very serious reason 
to choose a life of violence.

269
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,140
Perhaps.

270
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,450
We are through already?

271
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,450
No,not at all.

272
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,240
The sun is about to set.

273
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,280
Mecca's in that direction.

274
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,510
I'll have a prayer rug 
and water bowl sent in.

275
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,570
What the heck is going on here?

276
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,040
The nsa is routing all messages 
to us for language analysis.

277
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,660
You know,rumor has it,much to my chagrin,
that during national security emergencies,

278
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:28,140
our fair country turns all of its satellites homeward 
and records all electronic traffic in the whole U.S.A

279
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,750
Is this even legal?

280
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,890
Yeah,I don't really want to 
think about that right now.

281
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,610
Somewhere in this slew of chatter could be a shred 
of something that could save a whole lot of lives.

282
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,400
All right,well,cross reference 
gift with wedding allusions.

283
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,290
They'll be consistent with their code.

284
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,640
Here's something.

285
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,390
It rained all over the wedding,but 
the gift is waiting in the barn.

286
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,520
When was that call made?

287
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,340
Looks like just 
over 2 hours ago.

288
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,160
Let's run the words 
"barn and "wedding" through.

289
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,620
The wedding will now be held at 
vincent's barn off link and annandale.

290
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,060
Route the gift for delivery.

291
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,220
That's not a gift I wanna get.

292
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,220
I'll call hotch.

293
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,300
Yeah,jj.

294
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,320
We think we just found the 
cell's backup location.

295
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,010
It looks like a construction 
site in annandale,virginia.

296
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,120
Sounds like they may have 
another device ready to arm.

297
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,220
I'll get agent ryan to organize another 
raid. And notify gideon and reid.

298
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,600
Ok.

299
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,550
Can I offer you some water?

300
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,210
I offer you some first.

301
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,650
They only kept it there to 
show me what I could not have.

302
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,950
I'd like you to explain something to me.

303
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,230
How can you ignore the fact

304
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,020
that muhammad preached 
passivitywhile he was in mecca?

305
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,870
Do no violence.

306
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,280
His later message from 
medina was perfectly clear.

307
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,280
When violence come upon you,

308
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,720
you must fight back with violence.

309
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,490
He's quoting from the 
hadith,not from the qu'ran.

310
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,930
It's called the verse of the sword.

311
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,250
They argue that it cancels 
out earlier teachings.

312
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,850
Verse of the sword.

313
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,400
Just someone's spin on 
the words of the prophet.

314
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,060
It's not even part of the qu'ran.

315
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:24,550
But it does say in the qu'ran fight and 
slay the infidels wherever you find them

316
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,840
and seize them in every stratagem of war.

317
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,660
Unless they repent.

318
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,620
Establish regular prayers 
and practice regular charity.

319
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,170
Is it your intention,mr. Gideon,

320
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,470
to become a man of faith 
and revert to islam?

321
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,580
I am a man of faith.

322
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,780
I have repented,I pray regularly,

323
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,990
and I practice charity.

324
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,250
I have never committed 
violence against you,

325
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,920
so how is it that my faith would allow 
you to live and worship as you please,

326
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,010
and yours would take my 
life and snuff it out?

327
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,660
You are simply misguided 
people of the book.

328
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,340
- But if you revert to islam...   
- a billion muslims...

329
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,010
one billion muslims manage to 
practice their faith in peace...

330
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,230
for allah is surely merciful.

331
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,430
You...

332
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,010
inquired about my childhood earlier.

333
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,930
I will tell you...

334
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:41,780
that it was a happy one until 
one day a bomb fell out of the sky

335
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:47,690
and leveled the bazaar that 
I was in with my family.

336
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,200
I was only 8.

337
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,440
Must have been horrifying 
for such a young boy.

338
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,620
He's opening 
up about himself.

339
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,050
Maybe.

340
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,350
We need to verify 
what he's saying,though.

341
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,180
Speak.

342
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,840
Garcia,I need you to 
check something for me.

343
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,920
I'm looking for a stray bombing in a bazaar 
somewhere in egypt approximately 30 years ago.

344
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,350
Ok,greaT. That's not too obscure.

345
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,680
I don't need you to give me details.

346
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,320
We're just trying to set a baseline 
for jind allah's truthfulness.

347
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,080
I just need to know if 
it happened at all.

348
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,470
- When I know,you'll know.  
- Thank you.

349
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,710
When the rubble was cleared...

350
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,310
half...

351
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,030
of my family was dead.

352
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:37,090
It was on that day that I swore 
my life to vengeance for allah.

353
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:45,370
And for that very reason those holding 
you here can never let you leave.

354
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:54,490
Your only hope is to tell me so I can hopefully
one day share your struggle with the world.

355
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:01,090
Your government won't 
even admit that I exist.

356
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,220
How possibly can you tell 
my side of the story?

357
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,120
Hey,guys,we want silence. 
No conversation.

358
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,890
Let's be careful. We don't 
know what to expect.

359
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,430
- Ready?   
- Ready. Let's do it.

360
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,400
Clear!

361
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,280
This place is completely empty. 
We missed them again.

362
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,300
You got gideon,prentiss,and me.

363
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,110
It's hotch. We're at 
cell location number 2.

364
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,440
No cell members,no lab,no dispersal devices.

365
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,120
We're still looking for escape tunnels.

366
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,520
Call us.

367
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,520
We're running out of time. The attack's 
supposed to take place in less than 24 hours.

368
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,340
So getting jind allah to talk is
our only chance of finding them.

369
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,230
Time I confronted him with the truth.

370
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
What are you going to do?

371
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,900
Show him my hand.

372
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm going to give you the respect 
of telling you what just happened.

373
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,750
A team of agents raided 
an omega cell location.

374
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,510
Actually,both of them.

375
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,490
Our men are in place in 
annandale as we speak.

376
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,180
You gain nothing by remaining silent.

377
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,230
Jihad is forever.

378
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,480
Something's wrong.

379
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,040
His hands.

380
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,700
Gideon,something's wrong.

381
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,930
This guy seemed relieved 
by what you just told him.

382
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,160
Excuse me.

383
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,330
- What's the problem?  
- Get everybody out of there.

384
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,940
Now! Now! Now!

385
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,800
Everybody out.

386
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,440
It's a trap. Now!

387
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,550
I said out! Go!

388
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,250
How did a terror cell get its hands on anthrax 
without a single lab reporting a security breach?

389
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,140
Would we know if a foreign lab had a breach?

390
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,690
A foreign lab? Actually,no.

391
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,420
Garcia,isn't annandale where 
morgan and hotch are?

392
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,410
That's not a gas main explosion.

393
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,190
Please pick up.

394
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,970
Please pick up. Please pick up.

395
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,440
Yeah,it's morgan.

396
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,290
Hello? Garcia,can you hear me?

397
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,290
We saw the explosion on tv.

398
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,670
Yeah,I know. We lost a swat agent.

399
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,010
Oh,god.

400
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,340
Don't worry. Don't think you're 
gonna get rid of me that easy.

401
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,240
Do you need anything?

402
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,160
I know who to call if I 
do. Thanks,baby doll.

403
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,700
That's ok.

404
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,260
Is he all right?

405
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,980
Yeah.

406
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,790
We lost a swat agent.

407
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,460
Son of a bitch.

408
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,190
Sorry about that.

409
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,550
Yeah,me,too.

410
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,990
The chatter was a set-up. 
They knew we'd be listening.

411
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,680
They led us straight here.

412
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,210
Just tell me you know 
where to look next.

413
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,320
Not yet.

414
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,480
They ok?

415
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,290
We were right about the trap.

416
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,140
It was rigged to explode.

417
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,540
A swat agent was killed.

418
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,090
- Was anthrax involved?   
- No.

419
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,430
Then that's not the final target.

420
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,700
You look troubled,my friend.

421
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,480
You killed one of my men.

422
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,950
I was here with you.

423
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,530
The second location was a trap.

424
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,360
One of my agents was 
killed in the explosion.

425
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,230
This is war.

426
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,280
We expect casualties.

427
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,140
Shouldn't you?

428
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,460
He was a good man.

429
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,970
Well... if he would convert,

430
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,350
there would be no reason 
for him to fear death.

431
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,770
What do you say to his family?

432
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,330
I say...

433
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,760
where... were you to mourn...

434
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,050
when my son was murdered?

435
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,630
His son?

436
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,040
Did you see that?

437
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,650
When he told the story 
about his childhood,

438
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,250
the bomb landing in the 
bazaar,his behavior changed.

439
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,500
We know he was lying.

440
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,970
Garcia couldn't find any record of a 
bombing during the time jind allah was a boy.

441
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,860
Exactly,but this time when he mentioned 
his son,he looked at his hands,

442
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,800
like he had to concentrate 
to control his anger.

443
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,340
That first story wasn't about him.

444
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,100
It was about his son.

445
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,510
Which means it must 
have been more recent.

446
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,500
Garcia.

447
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,420
I need you to look for a 
bombing again in egypt,

448
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,550
but this time anything 
in the last 10 years.

449
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,260
On it.

450
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,940
We're looking for civilian 
casualties,an 8-year-old boy.

451
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,030
Ok. I'm cross referencing 
bombings and child victims.

452
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,530
7 years ago,in the heart of cairo,

453
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,830
egyptian government 
blamed hezbollah,

454
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,090
but conspiracy theories on the 
street claimed it was a joint U.S

455
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,550
Israli strike that went astray.

456
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,430
Your gross detainee's 
name is jamal abaza.

457
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,110
How about his son's name? 
Do you have that?

458
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,420
Amir abaza. 8. Killed in the blast.

459
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,250
All right. Find out everything you 
can on that. I'll get back to you soon.

460
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,890
We know his real identity.

461
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,440
It appears that there will be no peaceful 
resolution to our difficulties after all.

462
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,430
I haven't given up that hope.

463
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,490
It's time for your 
salut-ul-isha prayers.

464
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,150
May we speak again tomorrow?

465
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,570
You are asking me?

466
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,140
Yes.

467
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,270
Tomorrow,then.

468
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,360
Jamal abaza's been in 
the U.S. For a while.

469
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,030
He volunteered as the prison imam at the 
dearfield correctional center 3 years ago.

470
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,770
How could the cia not know that?

471
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,780
They're focused overseas. 
We're domestic.

472
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,400
Yeah. They probably sent a request 
for a domestic information search,

473
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,340
and it's somewhere making 
its way through channels.

474
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,450
If he was a prison imam,he must have 
recruited militant islamic society members.

475
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,110
M.I.S. Is an atypical 
prison organization.

476
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,590
They pick up an amalgam 
of ethnicities.

477
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,780
The qu'ran says that my lord...

478
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:12,800
those that slip through the cracks are 
the ones that traditional groups won't accept.

479
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,710
Outside these walls,you 
need to understand...

480
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,530
it's made up largely of 
american citizens.

481
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,090
American citizens with a reason 
for hating the government.

482
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,530
We're looking at 
home grown terrorists.

483
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,990
What the hell do you want?

484
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,280
The name jamal abaza. Does 
it mean anything to you?

485
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,070
Abaza was an imam in cairo.

486
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,670
He preached jihad to his followers,

487
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,960
but he fell off the grid 7 years ago.

488
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,130
That's because when his son died,
he took the jihad name jind allah.

489
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,890
He came to america to 
recruit sleeper cells.

490
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,040
You're telling us that that 
detainee in there is jamal abaza?

491
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,830
Amazing what you learn
when you talk to people.

492
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,310
He was also a prison imam 
in virginia 3 years ago.

493
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,750
Are you familiar with the 
militant islamic society?

494
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,770
They're home grown?

495
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,640
We know the cell that abaza put 
together has access to anthrax,

496
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,050
but we can't find any reports of 
any going missing in the states.

497
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,910
We have protocols that 
we have to follow.

498
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,930
You really going to allow 
a terrorist attack on U.S.

499
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,880
Soil because of protocols?

500
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,030
I told you what I learned in 
there because you and I,fbi,cia,

501
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,760
right now we have the ability to break 
through all the protocol and share information.

502
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,910
Let me see what we have.

503
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,760
Coordinate with agent jareau 
and penelope garcia at quantico.

504
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,420
Please.

505
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,790
Think it'll work?

506
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,940
I don't know.

507
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,940
Cia's tough. They play it 
pretty close to the vest.

508
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,620
Well,if we don't all work 
together,more people are gonna die.

509
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,480
A lot more.

510
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,230
How goes it with the cia?

511
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,780
I don't know what 
gideon said to them,

512
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,990
but they are feeding me 
information like crazy.

513
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,420
- They sure do generate intelligence.  
- Yeah.

514
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,750
Hopefully not too 
much to interpret.

515
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,960
Slept well?

516
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,110
For the first time 
since I've been here.

517
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,390
Good.

518
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,450
Until yesterday,

519
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,470
I was not permitted 
regular prayer.

520
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,840
We receive comfort 
from our prayers.

521
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,090
- We?  
- Human beings.

522
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,970
I say something wrong?

523
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,360
You placed us on the same level.

524
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,970
Aren't we?

525
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,260
Well,here I am thought 
of as less than human.

526
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,550
And in your jihad,I am.

527
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,580
Gideon...

528
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,560
what do you really want from me?

529
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,780
I already told you.

530
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,970
I want to understand you.

531
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,270
And if that is not possible?

532
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,220
Then that would be my loss.

533
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,520
It's almost time for your midday 
prayers. May I return later?

534
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,740
- I look forward to it.  
- Thank you.

535
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,820
Most of these tips are so new they 
haven't even been authenticated yet.

536
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,240
Yeah,but there's nothing in the established 
information that's remotely helpful.

537
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,310
Wait a minute. Anthrax.

538
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,390
- What?  
- Genimmune.

539
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,270
A dutch biotech firm reported that they may have 
had a security breach involving anthrax last week.

540
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,210
May have?

541
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,630
They're still doing a 
security and inventory sweep,

542
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,300
but they may be missing up to 
20 grams of lab grade anthrax.

543
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,880
20 grams.

544
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,580
Could potentially kill a 
quarter billion people.

545
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,000
He seems much calmer 
than he was yesterday.

546
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,250
May make any reading of his 
body language less accurate.

547
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,710
I know.

548
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,960
Is that what we want?

549
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,320
I hope so.

550
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,550
Well,isn't that the exact opposite of--

551
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,520
he hopes so?

552
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,600
We have less than 10 hours before 
the new crescent moon rises.

553
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,780
9.

554
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,510
Aren't you worried?

555
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,510
I've been with him long 
enough to trust him.

556
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,480
Cia is funneling you their 
dutch terror watch list.

557
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,500
Ok,I can cross reference that with any port of 
entry information we have as well as customs

558
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,710
and immigration enforcement.

559
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,160
You know,it would sure be a lot easier if there 
was a centralization of all this information.

560
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,680
Oh,dream on,J.

561
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,380
No one wants the other kids 
peeing in their sand box.

562
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,690
Tariq muhammad. Dutch 
citizen,islamic convert.

563
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,530
Traveled here 4 days ago 
under his original name.

564
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,120
Andre janssen.

565
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,750
And we have the address he 
listed on his customs form.

566
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,150
Thank you.

567
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,350
- We just got a lead.  
- Got a name?

568
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,910
And an address.

569
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,380
How does a terrorist cell 
exist right here in mayberry?

570
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,420
Infrared scanning still 
shows no one inside.

571
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,690
We're doing a soft entry in 
case it's booby trapped.

572
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,400
Sir,get in here!

573
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,080
We have 5 deceased males and 
what looks to be a crude lab,

574
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,340
all shot in the 
head execution style.

575
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,670
Any anthrax on the scene?

576
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,840
Only residue.

577
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,060
There's also packing and 
tags from 4 new backpacks.

578
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,110
All right,listen up.

579
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,090
- Backpacks?  
- They're already on the move. We're too late.

580
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,280
have you finished?

581
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,200
As you said,the sun is set.

582
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,360
Yes.

583
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,010
I'd like you to meet a 
colleague of mine. Dr.Reid.

584
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,990
- May we speak?  
- Of course.

585
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,890
I have a little time.

586
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,250
That was a joke.

587
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,220
I have all the time. Please.

588
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,910
A joke.

589
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,690
Well,we're making progress.

590
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,850
Yes,progress. That is true.

591
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,340
Is there no way for this 
thing to end? This jihad?

592
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,230
The jihad will end when 
allah wills its end.

593
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,080
Then how will you know 
that it is allah's will?

594
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,120
When the jihad ends.

595
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,880
I have been lying to you.

596
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,270
Of course you have.

597
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,490
My colleague has been outside 
watching us as we talked on monitors.

598
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,510
Watching your body language,
trying to figure you out.

599
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,250
Were you successful?

600
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,300
Somewhat.

601
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,020
Your name is jamal abaza.

602
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,740
Your son amir was killed in 2003 in the 
bombing at the mahfouz bazaar in cairo.

603
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,500
Since then,you've been recruiting M.I.S
Members in prison by convincing them

604
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,520
that U.S. Economic policies 
are exploiting third word nations

605
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,720
and turned them into extreme fundamentalists 
by promising a better existence with allah.

606
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,820
I would say that you were
more than somewhat successful.

607
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,730
But I did not learn

608
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,880
where your M.I.S. Cell was going 
to make an anthrax attack in the U.S.

609
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,880
At the new crescent tonight.

610
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,870
I have no knowledge 
of such a thing.

611
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,940
Yes,you do,mr.Abaza.

612
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,610
And there is still time.

613
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,700
What?

614
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,090
Are you sure?

615
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,250
something has happened?

616
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,610
How could you?

617
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,700
You choose to contort islam into 
an excuse for a life of violence.

618
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,910
You have perverted your 
faith to justify murder.

619
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,230
Now we are finally 
chatting,gideon.

620
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,630
You accuse americans of being 
puppeteers of the third world,

621
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,330
yet you used your own people's faith 
tonight to make them dance for you.

622
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,600
Why?

623
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:51,170
Why is it always those who profess to 
be the most fervent believers in this war,

624
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:55,390
they always manipulate other 
people to die for them.

625
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,000
Does your president 
go to battle?

626
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,890
Or does he send your children?

627
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,880
Tonight...

628
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,820
all those innocent people.

629
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,440
There is no such thing,
gideon. They were infidels.

630
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:15,570
And they were engaged in activities that 
spread american policies over the entire world.

631
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,100
Your incessant need to own things,

632
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,390
material things.

633
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,650
Your capitalism rests on the 
back of third world countries.

634
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,610
No one's hands are clean.

635
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,420
No one is innocent.

636
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,400
Those people tonight,
they were innocent.

637
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,190
They never hurt you.

638
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,200
They hurt me by existing.

639
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,780
Yes,the infidels shall fall 
at the hands of the righteous.

640
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,200
And that is when the 
jihad will end.

641
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:53,070
So you are ready to 
murder 4 billion people.

642
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,130
America has learned 
nothing from the past.

643
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,220
You harden targets 
like your power plants,

644
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,320
but you leave the soft 
root for our taking.

645
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,730
What has happened tonight will 
affect your economy for years,

646
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,480
the way september 11th 
affected air travel.

647
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,250
And maybe the next time a 
giant shopping center opens,

648
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,790
people will think 
twice before going.

649
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,220
And maybe next it 
will be a school.Hey!

650
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,750
You can shut the video 
feed down now,garcia.

651
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,920
Has the sun not set yet?

652
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,430
No.

653
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,100
No...

654
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,630
A shopping center.A mall.

655
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,230
It's a grand opening tonight 
not long after sunset.

656
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,790
That gives you about an hour.

657
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,060
God help us if they don't make iT.

658
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,710
Let's just hope we 
have somewhere to go.

659
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,740
Grand opening of the 
usa mall today.

660
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,240
It's the third largest in the country,and it's 
right smack in the middle of mclean,virginia.

661
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,430
Let's move.

662
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,000
What's going on with you?

663
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,500
You look like you've 
seen a ghost back there.

664
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,540
Haley's supposed to take jack to the 
new mall to have his portrait taken.

665
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,670
Well,go ahead and call her.

666
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,050
It's a breach of security.

667
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,600
You lose haley and jack,
screw this job.

668
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,410
You won't have a life.

669
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,660
I can't reach her.

670
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,530
Morgan,I'm going to find 
the security office.

671
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,780
Morgan!

672
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,320
Looks like loading 
dock security.

673
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,740
- Should we evacuate?   
- No,no.

674
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,460
We'd have mass panic.Let's go.

675
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,710
Hello!

676
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,580
- Fbi.   
- Fbi?

677
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,950
Are these all your security cameras?

678
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,160
Yes,sir.

679
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,580
What's this camera here?

680
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,960
That's the roof. East end.

681
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,370
Morgan,I've got 4 guys on 
the east end of the roof.

682
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,710
What's on that 
side of the roof?

683
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,410
Nothing.

684
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,760
No access doors to the mall?

685
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,490
Not unless you go 
through the air vents.

686
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,400
Morgan,it's the air vents.

687
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,500
They're going for the air vents.

688
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,120
Don't move!

689
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,880
Put the devices down and put 
your hands where I can see them!

690
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,480
Gun!

691
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,160
Police tonight foiled an apparent 
robbery attempt at the new usa mall,

692
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:21,500
which presumably have marred an 
otherwise successful grand opening.

693
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,080
Haley?

694
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,730
Hey,in here.

695
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,590
You're home.

696
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,170
Did you see that there was an 
attempted robbery at the new mall?

697
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,810
I'm glad I cancelled 
jack's photos.

698
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,580
I just decided I 
wanted you to be there.

699
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,140
It's better if we 
do it as a family.

700
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,860
Is everything ok?

701
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,700
Yeah,everything's perfect.

702
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,490
Ralph waldo emerson once said in order to 
learn the most important lessons of life,

703
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,180
one must each day surmount a fear.

704
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,300
When did you know you were 
gonna have to trick him?

705
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,810
The first time I talked to him.

706
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,220
You realized you couldn't break him?

707
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:17,500
Well,I realized he was too smart to have had 
that nextel phone registered to him accidentally.

708
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,690
He drew us there.

709
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,170
He wanted our presence at gtmo 
to confirm that he was successful.

710
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,400
And that's when you started 
moving up the time of his prayers.

711
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,440
If I'd used an actual clock,
he might have caught on.

712
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,090
So it was all a chess game.

713
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,180
We won this round...

714
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,740
but you heard him.

715
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,290
Jihad never ends.

716
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,550
Mate.

717
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,520
I quit.

718
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,960
Yield.Surrender.

719
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,330
Capitulate.I'm 
gonna take a nap.

720
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,230
Prentiss.

721
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,190
Sir?

722
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,680
You play?

723
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,990
Yes,sir. I play.
