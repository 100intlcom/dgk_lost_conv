I'm sorry.

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,560
You're Dr.Reid.

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,970
I'm sorry.Do I know you?

15
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,110
I just know what you do.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,850
Ok.

17
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,420
I saw you in georgetown a few weeks ago.

18
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,570
You gave a lecture on sexual sadism and

19
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,130
how you helped catch the mill creek killer in st.Louis.

20
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,240
I-I'm not much of a,uh-- a public speaker.

21
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,510
I don't know.I thought you seemed cool.

22
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,780
You look kind of young to go to georgetown.

23
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,380
Um,I'm a junior at northwest high school.

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,250
And you just go to lectures on anger excitation for fun?

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,790
I don't have a lot of friends.

26
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,480
So you're interested in profiling?

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,260
Yeah.I mean,

28
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,150
I read a lot,you know,true crime,

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,040
like graphic novels,mostly.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,020
They're all about whether there's really such a thing as evil,

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,880
like nature versus nurture,all that,

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,810
so i figured it'd be smart to hear it from an expert,you know?

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,280
So you said a lot of 'em kill prostitutes?

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,080
It's the number one serial killer target,actually.

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,680
Well,is that for sex or because they think they're dirty and they need to be punished?

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,620
Were you waiting here for me?

37
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,760
What would it mean if somebody were stabbing them and cutting off their hair?

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,720
I've never,uh-- I've never heard of a case like that.

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,910
Do you wanna go to the bau with me,

40
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,670
maybe talk to some of my other team members?

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,030
I actually have to go to school.

42
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,790
Give me your--your name and your number,and I'll call you and

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,510
hey,spence.

45
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,420
Jj,who's your contact at the D.C. Police?

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,200
Uh,victor barnes.Why?You need me to call him?

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,270
Hi.Detective barnes,please.

48
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,210
What's wrong?

49
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,880
Need to get that to everyone as soon as possible.

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,360
Uh,hi.Detective barnes,this is special agent dr.Spencer reid at the behavioral analysis unit at quantico.

51
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,170
Have you had any recent murders involving prostitutes,

52
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,550
maybe just jane does?

53
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,080
They would have been stabbed to death,and their hair would've been cut off by the killer.

54
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,130
When was the most recent victim?

55
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,860
I'll explain when I see you.I'll meet you in a half-hour.

56
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,520
What's going on?

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,680
D.C. May have a serial killer.

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,330
I think I just let him get away.

" We found her 4 days ago in an aly off "k" street.

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,330
Still no I.D.

65
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,120
Hey.Just got your message.

66
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,430
Aaron hotchner,vic barnes.

67
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,620
Hi.What have we got?

68
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,630
This is the second victim.

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,900
The first one was killed 3 months ago,

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,760
both in the early morning.

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,490
Both had their hair chopped?

72
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,180
Uniform didn't make the connection,because he was fixated on this.

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,190
The first victim didn't have anything carved on her?

74
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,940
Just a routine jane doe.

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,430
Take a look.

76
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,570
A lot are shallow.They're hesitation marks.

77
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,460
He's not certain he wants to be killing.

78
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,140
Makes you think the message he carved is sincere.

79
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,120
He's asking the police to help him stop.

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,340
Fits with your kid seeking you out.

81
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,140
Part of him wants to get caught.

82
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,660
I let him go.I'm sorry.

83
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,060
We'll find him.

84
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,100
If both murders took place in the morning,how come there were no witnesses?

85
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,700
The motels and alleys around the capitol are notorious.

86
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,490
People go out of their way not to look.

87
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,800
At night,no one can see down there.

88
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,610
During the day,

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,110
you just duck behind the dumpster or into a doorway.

90
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,870
Business is pretty heavy here in the mornings?

91
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,630
How do I know you're not just lookin' to crack down on us?

92
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,050
Because I'm telling you.

93
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,480
We're here trying to protect you.

94
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,370
A lot of johns from the hill stop by on their way to work.

95
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,190
We always say the same politicians yellin' about cleanin' up the hill,

96
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,300
the ones droppin' 50 bucks with us before they make the speech.

97
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,750
It's true,and the more important they think they are,

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,950
the quicker they accidentally finish up with us.

99
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,110
It's weird like that.

100
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,100
No,that's pretty much universal.

101
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,330
You recognize him at all?

102
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,190
I don't know his name or nothin'.

103
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,170
He hangs around,tries to pretend like he's not watching us.

104
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,110
He's just a horny kid,you know.

105
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,800
You didn't see him talking to any of the other girls out here?

106
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,580
I just figured he's the kind gets his little bit of danger

107
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,320
and goes home and takes business into his own hands.

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,040
Is he the one who did this?

109
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,230
We don't know,but someone did,

110
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,890
so you need to be careful.

111
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,550
We stick to the daylight and only work the high-end blocks.

112
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,270
How old are you?

113
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,270
21.

114
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,390
19.

115
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,160
Just watch out for each other,ok?

116
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,330
Oh,agent hotchner,karen steyer.

117
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,540
Congresswoman,how do you do?

118
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,340
I'm fine,thank you.They said it was fine to wait in here.

119
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,790
Of course.What can I do for you?

120
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,480
Well,I have talked to my people,

121
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,300
and I understand that we have a potential serial killer targeting prostitutes in D.C.

122
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,700
That was awfully fast.

123
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,110
I have awfully good people.

124
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,100
Sounds like it.

125
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,040
I'd like you to promise me that if your team stays on the case,

126
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,660
uh,you won't publicize the murders.

127
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,230
I'm afraid I can't make that promise.

128
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,910
With all due respect,you will notice that I said,

129
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,670
"if you stay on the case.

130
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,570
" I really don't like doing this,honestly

131
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,980
but as you know,the bau cannot join an investigation

132
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,870
unless they are invited by the local enforcement agency.

133
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,590
What's this about?

134
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,260
6 months ago,I introduced a major initiative declaring crime in D.C.An epidemic.

135
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,710
I'm familiar with the bill.

136
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,150
Makes additional federal funds available.

137
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,890
You target lifestyle crimes like prostitution and drug use,

138
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,110
and hopefully the overall crime rate drops.

139
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
Worked in new york.

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,530
It worked in L.A.It's worked here.

141
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,720
And in 4 days,I'm set to stand at the base of the capitol

142
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
and announce that petty crime in D.C.

143
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,080
Is down 43% and violent crime is down 37%.

144
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,500
The last thing I need is the press announcing that we have a serial killer murdering prostitutes.

145
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,920
I understand that.

146
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,140
But by not alerting the media,

147
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,770
we're putting women at risk.

148
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,480
I'm not asking you to back down.

149
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,300
Work your case.

150
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,950
Catch your killer.

151
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,790
Just do it quietly.

152
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,870
And if I don't?

153
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,710
I guarantee you won't work it at all.

154
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,350
Oh,a little unsolicited advice.

155
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,780
You're driven.You're bright.

156
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,510
You're exactly the kind of person who could run the bureau someday.

157
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,920
You might as well accept now

158
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,770
that leading the fbi has as much to do with politics

159
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,940
as it does with law enforcement.Good day.

160
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,020
This is impossible.

161
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,750
Says you.

162
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,500
There's nothing in the juvenile offender records.

163
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,690
So you think like a high school kid.

164
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,680
I was 12,and I hadn't been through puberty when I was in high school.

165
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,030
Ok,reset.

166
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,230
I think like a high school student.

167
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,820
You think like a profiler.

168
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,420
He said he was a junior,right?

169
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,070
Mm-hmm.

170
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,300
The first rule of the teen years,

171
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,090
when talking to an authority figure,always lie and say you're older.

172
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,550
He's probably a sophomore.

173
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,620
Ok.

174
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,540
His coat was lamb's wool,

175
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,140
but it didn't look vintage.

176
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,830
It   fit like it had been tailored for him.

177
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,640
That means money.

178
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,830
In D.C.,Money would mean private school.

179
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,780
Look at you go.

180
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,020
-Even a lie has to be within the depth of your own experience,right?
-Fair enough,fair enough.

181
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,770
Uh   I'm a junior at northwest high school.

182
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,080
Pull up the district that serves northwest high.

183
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,100
Are there any private schools within those boundaries?

184
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,480
Uh,3.

185
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,320
Do any of them offer elective courses at georgetown?

186
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,050
One.The morton school.

187
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,780
-Pull up the junior class.
-Ah!

188
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,600
Uh,sophomore class.

189
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,340
Ah,if I do say so myself.

190
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,600
Wait,wait.Stop.

191
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,490
Nathan harris.

192
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,490
We got him.

193
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,500
<font color=blue>I got a feelin' that you wanna come over </font>

194
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,930
<font color=yellow>The blade slices the whore's neck.</font>

195
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,870
<font color=blue>ooh ooh,ooh ooh ooh</font>

196
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,770
<font color=blue>I get you here …</font>

197
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,190
I'll be right there.

198
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,040
<font color=blue>Ooh ooh,ooh ooh ooh </font>

199
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,550
I'm jason gideon with the fbi. Dr. Reid.Agent morgan.

200
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,330
<font color=yellow>The whore falls.</font>

201
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,050
We're looking for your son nathan.

202
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,920
Why?

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,050
<font color=yellow>Bloody.Dead.</font>

204
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,640
We just wanna ask him some questions.

205
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,970
Well,not until you explain what's going on.

206
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,450
Uh,your son came to talk to me this morning about a murder case.

207
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,010
Why would nathan know anything about a murder?

208
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,740
No,mom,it's true.

209
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,360
I--I did talk to him.

210
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,670
I'm just 19 do you mind if I speak to him alone?****************不确定

211
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,940
-We'll stay out here,ma'am.
-O-ok.

212
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:28,850
<font color=blue>I'm just 19 ohh hoo hoo you know I-- </font>

213
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,080
I knew if you were really good,you'd find me.

214
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,740
Is that why you were waiting for me?

215
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,760
You--you wanted to get caught?

216
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,110
What do you mean,"get caught"?

217
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,300
Oh-- hey.

218
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,380
Stay right there and keep your hands where I can see them.

219
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,080
It's just the text for a graphic novel.

220
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,900
About killing prostitutes?

221
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,040
Yeah,jack the ripper.It's a famous case.

222
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,860
This isn't a game,kid.

223
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,230
I know.

224
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,770
You knew specific details about a murder that hasn't been publicized.

225
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,190
But I didn't kill her.

226
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,050
I just   I really wanted to.

227
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,450
Nathan,if you didn't do it,how'd you know the details of the murder?

228
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,450
'Cause I saw the body.

229
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,850
It was early.It was before school.

230
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,350
She--she was dressed in red.

231
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,310
She'd been stabbed a lot,and her hair was all chopped off.

232
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,490
Where was that?

233
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,520
In an alley off of "k" street.

234
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,420
They take men down there for sex.I see 'em do it all the time.

235
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,080
What were you doing down there?

236
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,300
I don't know.I just sort of

237
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,690
end up there sometimes,you know?

238
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,000
I--I stay out all night,and I just come back in the morning,

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,080
and if my mom's at work,I don't even bother coming home.

240
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,590
Thinking dark thoughts is a far cry from being a danger.

241
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,450
I know that.

242
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,100
I don't think anyone's personal demons would hold up to scrutiny.

243
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,060
Mine wouldn'T.Would yours?

244
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,320
No.

245
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,990
He's a good boy.

246
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,420
He's exceptionally bright.

247
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,450
He just lives in his head more than other kids.

248
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,950
So it's just the two of you?

249
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,060
His father died when he was 9.

250
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,400
How'd he handle that?

251
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,530
Well,emotionally it was grueling,

252
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,100
but we got through it together.

253
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,040
-And you're close.
-Hmm.

254
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,640
I'd say very.

255
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,070
Don't go misinterpreting that.

256
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,750
You teach at G.W.Medical school,you're also on call at the hospital?

257
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,520
2 weeks a month.

258
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,310
So nathan must have a lot of freedom.

259
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,000
I treat him like a man,because he's always handled his responsibility.

260
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,190
Why didn't you call the police?

261
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
I don't know.

262
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,390
Nathan,the prostitutes I talked to say you watch them.

263
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,340
I'd never touch them.

264
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,200
You fantasize about having sex with them?

265
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,700
No,I told you,I think about killing them.

266
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,050
Look,after the lecture,

267
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,520
I saw you at the metro stop a few times,

268
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,220
and I thought maybe you could help me.

269
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,690
How?

270
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,170
I don't know.I saw that body,

271
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,150
and I felt excited,and that really scared me.

272
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,640
Is it possible that you actually killed those prostitutes,

273
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,570
but you just don't want to admit it to yourself?

274
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,610
No.

275
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,080
Then why'd you run away from me?

276
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,940
'Cause I don't know,but I thought you'd say I was crazy and there was no way to stop it.

277
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,610
-Thank you.
-Sure.

278
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,320
Ma'am,we'd like to let the juvenile authorities hold him overnight so we can do a psychological evaluation.

279
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,410
I can't believe this is real.

280
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,930
Well,right now it's just an evaluation.

281
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,720
I'd encourage nathan to have a lawyer present.

282
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,230
I don't know what he's going through,

283
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,370
but the nathan I know is a sweet boy.

284
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,880
I believe you.

285
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,680
Do we have your permission?

286
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,730
I'll show you where to sign the paperwork.

287
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,700
The juvenile authorities are waiting for nathan harris.

288
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,750
He's in interrogation.

289
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,850
Is he our unsub?

290
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,020
I don't know.

291
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,180
He says he didn't do it.

292
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,820
He actually seems sincere.

293
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,670
But he's a smart kid,

294
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,570
and part of the sexual-sadist profile is the ability to mimic honesty and sincerity.

295
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,640
The police are here for you.

296
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,340
Dr. Reid.

297
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,990
Yeah?

298
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,720
I know I,um,don't deserve any favors,

299
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,870
but whatever my psych eval says,you promise you'll tell me the truth?

300
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,930
Um,my mom says a promise doesn't count unless you say it out loud.

301
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,670
I promise.

302
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,670
Ok.Thank you.

303
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,100
You know,he might have killed 2 women.

304
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,140
It's not your job to hold his hand through this.

305
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,820
It's like with my mom.

306
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,400
I used to think that if I could just understand

307
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,300
absolutely everything there is to know about schizophrenia,

308
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,370
then I'd somehow be able to fix it.

309
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,640
You can'T.I'm sorry.

310
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,500
Guys.I need everybody in the conference room.

311
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,300
If nathan harris isn't our unsub,we need a working profile.

312
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,960
D.C.Police sent us these photos of the first victim.

313
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,020
This was the unsub's first kill.

314
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,760
He held his urges in check for 3 months,

315
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,730
and when he couldn't control them any more,he sent this message to the cops.

316
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,130
We know the "help" and the hesitation marks mean he was ambivalent about the kill.

317
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,030
What we don't know is why he chopped the hair.

318
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,570
He didn't take it with him.

319
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,420
We know it's not a trophy.

320
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,640
It's probably a way to minimize some of their power,robs them of their femininity.

321
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,950
That fits with him killing during the early morning.

322
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,120
It's the time when prostitutes have the least power sexually,

323
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,280
as opposed to at night,when he might see them as being on the prowl.

324
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,710
Hey,I know we're just spitballing this here,

325
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,360
but this profile points to nathan harris.

326
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,130
I don't wanna talk about nathan harris.

327
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,030
Hotch,she is right.

328
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,460
He reached out for help.

329
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,370
This is an adolescent kid.

330
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,950
He's probably intimidated sexually.

331
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,840
I don't care how many times he says he didn't do it.

332
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,960
He knew about the last victim,and he admitted to getting off on seeing her dead.

333
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,990
We've got nathan harris.

334
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,690
It doesn't do us any good to talk about him now.

335
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,550
I just wanna make sure that if it's not him,

336
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,460
we stay on top of thing before it takes on a life of its own.

337
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,520
All right,all right,all right.

338
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,360
We know our unsub is a sexual sadist.

339
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,930
The symbolism of stabbing them probably means he's impotent.

340
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,700
The only way he can get off is by killing.

341
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,430
Considering that cutting their hair and killing during the

342
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,520
early morning both stem from feeling powerless,

343
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,780
there's a chance his pathology's more than sexual.

344
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,630
What do you mean?

345
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,100
This is D.C.Power's the most important commodity.

346
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,800
Maybe this guy feels impotent in his professional life as well.

347
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,160
But why these particular women?

348
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,280
Simplest answer is that he has access.

349
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,510
Well,northwest D.C.Has 3 major hubs of prostitution--

350
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,330
near florida avenue;

351
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,950
off logan circle;

352
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,910
and mcpherson square,where the victims were found.

353
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,520
Probably works in or around capitol hill.

354
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,700
Well,I'll go back out on the street in the morning

355
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,680
and see if any of these women know someone who fits that description.

356
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,670
Good.

357
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,440
It's late.Let's go home.

358
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,660
Um,shouldn't we get word out to the papers?

359
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,610
Not yet.

360
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,930
Well,it's not too late to make the morning edition.

361
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,190
I said no.

362
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,730
Hey!

363
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,580
You seen little holly?

364
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,760

Does he have to be here?

378
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,120
It's for your own protection.

379
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,260
He's here to make sure we're not talking about the case,just about you.

380
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,890
So I don't wet the bed or start fires.

381
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,660
Heh.

382
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,320
I see you've read dr.Harris' warning signs of psychopathy.

383
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,710
Yeah.Is that wrong?

384
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,870
No,it's healthy.

385
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,490
You're intellectually curious.

386
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,530
You wanna understand how you're feeling.

387
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,530
So you don't wet the bed or start fires.

388
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,690
Tell me what worries you.

389
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,180
I've just been,um

390
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,890
thinking about stuff.

391
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,360
About hurting women?

392
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,860
Yeah.

393
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,530
Have you ever hurt anyone?

394
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,090
I killed a bird once.

395
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,730
I know that's on the list.It's one of the signs.

396
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,990
Why'd you kill the bird?

397
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,380
'Cause I was sad.

398
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,540
How'd you feel afterwards?

399
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,240
Better.

400
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,570
Why?

401
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,990
I don't know,'cause

402
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,680
it was dead,and I was still alive.

403
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,740
Is that why you wanna hurt women,to feel better?

404
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,530
I don't know.

405
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,770
Have you ever seen a woman naked?

406
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,340
Don't worry about him.

407
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,030
No offense.

408
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,770
None taken.

409
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,520
Um   a few years ago.

410
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,320
My mom's med school,her students get cadavers.

411
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,600
So how'd that make you feel?

412
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,060
Good.

413
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,100
Excited.

414
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,260
And sick.

415
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,590
Perfectly natural,boy to feel excited,he sees a naked body,even a cadaver.

416
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,680
Yeah,but now that's the only part that I think about.

417
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,650
Which part?

418
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,970
Them being dead.

419
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,410
So when you watch the prostitutes,you don't imagine having sex with them?

420
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,130
No,I think about cutting them.

421
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,870
Why?

422
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,300
I don't know,maybe to look inside.

423
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,350
Or sometimes I think about

424
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,690
feeling their blood in my hands and feeling it flow through my fingers.

425
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,770
Does that ever make you climax,

426
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,810
just by thinking of that?

427
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,660
I know I'm crazy.

428
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,850
Did I say that?

429
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,660
No,but

430
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,270
what do you call pictures in your head that you can't make go away?

431
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,910
Can I talk to you?

432
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,150
Stay here.I'll be right back.

433
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,030
It's my opinion that nathan should be hospitalized.

434
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,730
What?

435
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,740
I think he needs full-time medical attention.

436
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm a doctor.

437
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,290
He's having homicidal fantasies that are directly linked to his sexual impulses and release.

438
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,510
Well, he came to your agent.

439
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,300
That shows that he's concerned.

440
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,960
In his heart, he doesn't want to hurt anyone.

441
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,710
Positive sign, but intelligence and awareness don't always allow us to control our urges.

442
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,490
Admitting the problem doesn't mean you can manage it.

443
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,360
If I put him in a hospital, I'd be telling him that he's a monster.

444
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,150
No, no, no, no, no.

445
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,510
He's just-- right now he's sick, and he needs help.

446
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,460
No.

447
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,290
If an alcoholic cannot control his impulses, ma'am, he drinks.

448
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,200
You need to consider what happens with someone fighting psychotic urges.

449
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,190
I'm not naive.

450
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,830
I'm not gonna turn a blind eye, but I have to protect my son.

451
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,430
He needs to be with professionals.

452
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,270
I have access to the best in washington.

453
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,790
I'll make sure that he sees someone every single day, but I am not gonna lock him away.

454
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,260
Have a seat.

455
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,040
I don't appreciate being questioned in front of other agents.

456
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,300
It was not my intention.

457
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,580
I'm sorry.

458
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,960
What were you talking to congresswoman steyer about the other day?

459
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,750
She stopped by to say hello.

460
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,720
She worked with my mother, so I've known her since I was a kid.

461
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,270
Did you tip her off about this case?

462
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,910
No.

463
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,390
This team can't function if I don't trust the people on it.

464
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,850
Sir, if I touched a nerve out there today, I'm sorry, but I don't deserve this.

465
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,650
You mysteriously showed up at the bau after one of my team members was involved in a questionable shooting.

466
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,270
Right.

467
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,120
You've done good work.

468
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,930
I'm not questioning that.

469
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,400
But I will not put up with a political agenda.

470
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,540
My mother's a career politician.

471
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,600
You worked with her.

472
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,200
Did you like her?

473
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,860
She's an impressive women.

474
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,070
Well, I think politics makes people distrustful.

475
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,920
I think it makes them hate themselves.

476
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,140
I think it tears families apart and damages people.

477
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,950
So if there's nothing else,

478
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,400
I would like to get back out on the street and find out who's killing these women.

479
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,370
Sir.

480
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,730
Have you reached a conclusion about nathan harris yet?

481
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,820
Profiles and evaluations are an inexact science.

482
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,900
But your professional opinion?

483
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,130
Not a question of whether he ends up killing someone.

484
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,110
It's when.

485
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,620
Nathan.

486
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,290
Nathan, honey.

487
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,880
Nathan.

488
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,940
Oh, my god.

489
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,610
He's gotta be out here, right?

490
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,490
Where else would he be?

491
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,990
I still can't believe his mother's not out here searching for him.

492
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,220
I told her it'd be better if she waited for him at home.

493
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,870
Reid, you know this is not your responsibility.

494
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,340
It is.

495
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,190
I can't explaiN.

496
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,730
Well, try me.

497
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,280
He knows I understand him.

498
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,860
Of course you do.

499
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,940
You're a profiler.

500
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,400
It's more than that.

501
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,860
How?

502
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,070
I know what it's like to be afraid of your own mind.

503
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,580
What's up with hotch today?

504
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,370
I don't know.

505
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,150
Maybe he tied that knot in his tie a little too tight again.

506
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,080
Yeah.

507
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,560
Ok.

508
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,970
We're on our way.

509
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,250
They just found a body.

510
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,280
I'd say he's getting bolder.

511
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,230
If it's the same unsub.

512
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,470
Think it could've been nathan?

513
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,610
This kill was fast and messy.

514
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,930
There's no cut hair, no message carved.

515
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,760
Not to mention killing at night.

516
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,420
None of it's our unsub's signature.

517
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,880
Excuse me, agent.

518
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,680
They found the boy you're looking for.

519
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,500
Says he's beenere 4 hours.

520
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,520
Got a lot of people worried.

521
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,410
Sorry.

522
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,770
Told that policeman that you've been here 4 hours?

523
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,340
I snuck out, and I started walking, like I couldn't control it,

524
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,450
so I figured I'd come here and try and fight it.

525
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,590
Has anybody seen you here?

526
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,150
Doesn't matter, anyway.

527
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,350
It does matter, nathan.

528
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,700
A woman was stabbed tonight, and nobody saw you.

529
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,580
I'm gonna have to bring you in as a suspect.

530
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,510
You gonna cuff me?

531
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,130
Let's go.

532
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,550
Do you wanna know what I've been doing all night?

533
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,220
Hmm?

534
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,480
Just been sitting here, thinking 

535
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:42,870
the only way for me to save people's lives in the future is to kill myself.

536
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,140
So nathan's in custody?

537
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,690
They're holding him downtown.

538
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,710
You really think he killed that last woman?

539
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,120
It's possible.

540
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,160
But nathan's evolving.

541
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,140
This last kill, it feels like a devolution.

542
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,450
It was sloppy and angry.

543
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,630
Nathan's smart and directed.

544
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,660
He's used to achieving.

545
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,090
If he decides to kill, it'll be clinical and efficient.

546
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,210
So where does that leave us?

547
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,080
Back to the profile.

548
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,510
First victim, he gets a taste for killing.

549
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,000
Second, he asks the police to help stop him.

550
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,060
By the third, he feels like they've failed him.

551
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,780
He's already devolving.

552
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,610
The fourth, no ritual, no message, just a brutal murder.

553
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,150
It's true that he's devolving, but this last victim definitely had a message.

554
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,900
You don't dump a body across from the capitol building by accident.

555
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,100
Especially not when a congresswoman is about to proclaim success against the crime epidemic.

556
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,760
Exactly.

557
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,820
Guys, that press conference wasn't announced yet.

558
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,830
Only someone with inside information would know that.

559
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,370
We profiled the unsub felt limited in his job.

560
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,110
What's more powerless than being a bit player on the washington stage?

561
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,000
You know, if he felt like he did his part to clear the prostitutes off the street, but was never heard, 

562
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,740
he might have felt so personally betrayed that he literally had to carve his frustration out on those women.

563
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,670
So the profile was right.

564
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,190
We were just wrong about who the message was for.

565
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,240
We need to get a list of anyone who advocated on behalf of that bill.

566
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,220
Prentiss, when you went back to talto the prostitutes, did a profile ring a bell with any of them?

567
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,350
A few of them described what sounded like the same man, but when I showed them mug shots, I came up empty.

568
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,700
Let's go bk to them.We're gonna need their help.

569
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,920
What are you thinking about, hotch?

570
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,030
I need to get a message to congresswoman steyer.

571
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,850
How quickly can we put together a press conference?

572
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,150
How fast do you need it?

573
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,070
May I have your attention, please?

574
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,930
A day from now, there will be an announcement across the street on the steps of the capitol 

575
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,520
that crime is down significantly in washington.

576
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,840
This is a fact.

577
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,380
It is also a fact however, that there's a serial killer who's been targeting the prostitutes who work in this area.

578
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,940
In fact, the last victim was fod not a hundred yards from where we're standing.

579
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,780
We're here today to let you know that the police and the fbi are working tirelessly on this case.

580
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:49,120
We'd like to stress to the women who work on these streets to please take caution.

581
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,510
All right, first I'm gonna give a brief description of the man we're looking for, and then we'll take some questions.

582
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:59,850
We believe the man responsible for these crimes works on or around capitol hill, 

583
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:06,040
possibly at a research or advocacy group dealing with issues of crime control or prevention.

584
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,420
The lower the group is on the washington food chain, the better.

585
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:13,660
This guy, he feels like his voice isn't being heard, and make sure to check for any advocacy groups promoting morality or values.

586
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,610
Ok, reality check.

587
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,740
What you're looking for--needle.

588
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,140
This--haystack.

589
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,120
Garcia, we don't have to find it.

590
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,560
We just need to get to the people who can.

591
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,010
Ok.

592
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,730
You could've done that much more quietly.

593
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,570
I know.

594
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,740
There's some people I'd like for you to meet.

595
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,230
Right this way.

596
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,980
Just what point are you trying to make?

597
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,580
These women described similar experiences with the same man.

598
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,120
We showed them police mug photos, and they didn't recognize him.

599
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,110
We thought maybe you might know who he is.

600
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,950
Did you think you could shock me by treating me to this sideshow?

601
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,530
Sideshow?

602
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,780
Lady, enough of the men you work with treat themselves to us every day.

603
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,440
My apologies, ladies.

604
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,050
Could you please tell the congresswoman who it is we're looking for.

605
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,660
He's tall and bald, and he's got sad eyes.

606
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,470
He was always wearing a turtleneck with this long, dark coat, looked like a morticiaN.

607
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,150
That's right.

608
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,700
Hung around just watching for months before he finally got his nerve on, but then he just wanted to watch.

609
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,690
Freak paid me and racine 200 bucks to turn each other's knobs,

610
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,130
but then he started screaming at us that we were low women.

611
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,350
Same thing with me, and his voice got real high and nasal when he got excited.

612
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,010
Does that sound like anyone that you know?

613
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,250
No.

614
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,370
I'm gonna read you a list of groups that lobbied on behalf of your legislation.

615
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,990
Keeping in mind the description you just heard,

616
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,350
tell me if anyone associated with these groups could be the man we're looking for.

617
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,680
Uh, "the crime policy institute, "the center for safety,

618
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,260
citizens' brigade, decency watch

619
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,630
oh, my god.

620
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,060
Decency watch?

621
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,200
The man who runs it.

622
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,240
Ronald weems.

623
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,030
Do you know him?

624
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,720
No.

625
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,560
I mean, yes, but he's a nobody.

626
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,390
But he fits this description?

627
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,680
Perfectly.

628
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,930
I need to get back to work.

629
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,510
Again?

630
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,520
Yes, again.

631
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,400
Can't be helped.

632
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,370
We're looking for ronald weems.

633
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,480
I-I'm sorry.

634
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,790
You just missed him.

635
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,060
Why don't you come back in a couple hours?

636
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,510
Don't you wanna know why we're here?

637
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,130
Of course.

638
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,810
Yes.I'm sorry.

639
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,420
We're investigating the murders of local prostitutes.

640
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,870
I-I'm glad that ronald is helping you with that, but I'm afraid I don't know anything about it.

641
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,020
We'd just like to take a look in your husband's office.

642
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,850
Please?

643
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,430
Ronald doesn't allow anyone in there.

644
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,310
I'm sorry.

645
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,920
You really should come back.

646
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,300
In the last 6 months did your husband start asking you to play out sexual fantasies?

647
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,410
Excuse me?

648
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,930
Possibly even berated you if you played along?

649
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,360
I don't think that's appropriate.

650
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,310
When it finally stopped about a month ago, you were relieved.

651
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,660
Ma'am, you're afraid to ask us why we're here.

652
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Now, in your heart, you know we're not here because ronald's helping us with this investigation.

653
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,670
Good night.

654
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,880
You've been glad to have him leave the house at odd hours, because he's been angry and frustrated.

655
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,950
When he comes home, he feels like the man you married again.

656
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,140
His office.

657
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,880
Please.

658
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,820
"Why won't they clean them off the street?

659
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,500
"The blood is on their hands.

660
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,070
"I see a world set free of vice and vermin, cleansed of the blood of the whores who walk the street.

661
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,670
"Do you know where your husband went?

662
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,820
 He said he had work to do.

663
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,630
hey, you ever seen this guy, huh, out here doing business?

664
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,140
 Can you tell me if you've seen this man?

665
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,260
 Ma'am, you ever seen this face?

666
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,900
 No?

667
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,160
 Never? Out here talking to the ladies?

668
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,140
 Sorry.

669
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,270
 You seen this guy?

670
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,170
 You sure?

671
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:20,590
 I ain't seen him.

672
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,300
 Thank you.

673
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,120
 Thanks.

674
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,920
 My man, you ever seen this cat out here doing business?

675
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,660
 Excuse me.

676
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,130
 You ever seen this man before?

677
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,450
 Nothing?

678
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,750
 No. You?

679
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,360
 Seen him?

680
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,000
 You didn't even look.

681
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,130
 Do you know this man?

682
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,230
 Thank you.

683
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,080
 He's gotta be out here somewhere.

684
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,420
 How much?

685
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:14,970
 Hey, where you going?

686
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,290
 Don't run away from me.

687
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,000
Ronald weems, don't move!

688
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,940
 Put your hands in the air and get down on your knees.

689
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,040
 They lied to me.

690
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,660
Get her out of here!

691
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,890
 On the ground!

692
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,350
 He killed my friend!

693
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,680
I know. Stop it!

694
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,480
 She maced me.

695
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,340
 Yeah, she did.

696
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,390
 They said they'd clean 'em off the streets.

697
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,610
 They lied.

698
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,660
 What was I supposed to do?!

699
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,600
 Hey.

700
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,040
 Hi.

701
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,970
 I heard the juvenile authorities let you go today.

702
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,630
 I'm sorry I wasn't there.

703
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,470
 Mm, it's all right.

704
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,100
 Where's your mom?

705
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,740
 Oh, she had to go back to work.

706
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,910
 I told her I was coming to see you.

707
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,180
 So were you there when they caught him?

708
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,560
 Yeah, I was.

709
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,210
 Did he say how long he knew what he was?

710
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,450
 No.

711
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,550
 Well, do you think it's possible to maybe talk to him or 

712
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,370
 I'm sorry.You're not him.

713
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,720
 Who we are is--it's constantly evolving.

714
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,110
 I'm a lot older than you, and I'm changing all the time.

715
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,170
 You know, this-- this job changes me.

716
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,200
 You've changed me.

717
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,170
 You sought me out to try to understand how not to harm people.

718
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,430
 It's a far more important part of who you are than the one that scares you.

719
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:04,860
 My mom wants to have me go to a hospital for a little bit.

720
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,010
 Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

721
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,780
 You know, once they lock me up, they're never gonna let me out of there.

722
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,960
 You don't know that.

723
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,030
 Whatever.

724
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,540
 I just came to say good-bye.

725
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,980
 When you going in?

726
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,800
 Supposed to be tomorrow.

727
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,860
 So, last night of freedom.

728
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,570
 I don't know.

729
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,850
 I'm-- thank you for caring.

730
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,900
T.S. Eliot wrote between the desire and the spasm, ""between the potency and the existence,"

731
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,050
between the essence and the descent, falls the shadow.

732
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,660
This is the way the world ends.

733
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,520
"You looking for a date?

734
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,640
 Suit yourselF.

735
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,440
 You scared me.

736
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,470
 I'm actually looking for a date.

737
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,430
 Come on.

738
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,540
 Come on, you and me, we're hitting the town.

739
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:18,110
 No offense, garcia, but I'm not really feeling like I'd make the, uh, best company right now.

740
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,970
 Oh, no.

741
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,920
 Up.

742
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,050
 Up.

743
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,040
 Do not make me hurt you.

744
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,190
 There you go.

745
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,030
 There you go.

746
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,360
 Just relax.

747
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,370
 Don't you wanna feel me?

748
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,160
 See?

749
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,940
 There.

750
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,450
 How does that make you feel?

751
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,770
 I don't know.

752
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,270
 Yes, you do.

753
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,400
 I don't know.

754
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,990
 It's-- it's not right.

755
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,230
 It's ok, baby.

756
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,050
 You're just nervous.

757
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,970
 There you go.

758
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,660
 It's not working.

759
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,180
 Everything's gonna work just fine.

760
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,770
 Don't laugh at me.

761
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,810
 Nobody's laughing.

762
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,030
 Let me help you.

763
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,570
 Don't touch me.

764
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,910
 You're just a whore.

765
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,170
 You have no idea what I could do to you!

766
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,100
 How 'bout we both just walk away?

767
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,120
 No charge.

768
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,550
 No.

769
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,820
 You don't wanna do this.

770
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,770
 I have to.

771
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,510
 Have you met esther?

772
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,960
 You like?

773
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,150
 Only 150,000 miles on her.

774
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,860
Hello.

775
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,790
 Hey.

776
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,090
 What?

777
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,870
 Oh, god.

778
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,030
 Uh, uh, stay-- stay where you are.

779
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,120
 I'm calling an ambulance.

780
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,140
 I--I need you to drive, garcia.

781
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,210
 Yeah, yeah.

782
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,970
He just started slashing himself up.

783
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,070
 Oh, dear lord.

784
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,750
 All right, give me your scarf.

785
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,120
 Tie it around there as tight as you can.

786
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,810
 Get--get anything at all, a belt.

787
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,980
 Tie it!

788
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,720
 Is it tight?

789
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,760
 Is it tight?

790
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,540
 I think so.

791
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,180
 The paramedics stop.

792
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,960
 Don'T.

793
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,080
 I'm gonna keep pressure on him.

794
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,790
 No.

795
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,660
 Where the hell are the medics?!

796
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,270
 I don't know.

797
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:28,540
 Is it tight?

798
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,610
 I don't know. I think so.

799
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,760
 Don'T.

800
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,180
 I'm not gonna let you die.

801
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,530
 No.

802
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,100
 Where are the medics?

803
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,730
 You can let go now.

804
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:40,450
 Sir.

805
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,510
Reid.

806
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,910
 Sir.

807
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,100
 Sir, we're paramedicS.

808
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,780
 We're here to help you.

809
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,000
 Can you tell me your name, sir?

810
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,040
 How did she know to call reid?

811
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,470
 Nathan set reid's business card on the table before he cut himself, like a suicide note.

812
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Paramedics say he wouldn't've made it without you.

813
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,280
 You saved his life.

814
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
 He wanted me to let him die.

815
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,560
 He's sick.

816
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,070
 He needed saving.

817
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,980
How many people's lives did I risk in the future?

818
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,220
 Profiles can be wrong.

819
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,080
 What if it's not?

820
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,200
 What if next time, he kills somebody?

821
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,240
 Then you catch him.
