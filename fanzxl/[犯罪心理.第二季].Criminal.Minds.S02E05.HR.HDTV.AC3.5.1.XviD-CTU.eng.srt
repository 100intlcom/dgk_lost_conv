1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,800
DOESN'T ANYBODY
EVER GO HOME?

2
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:16,899
YOU'RE HERE.

3
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,233
EXACTLY.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,062
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T
WANT TO MODEL

5
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,667
YOUR SOCIAL LIFE
AROUND MINE.

6
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:23,200
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

7
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,467
HOTCH AND
MORGAN TOOK OFF.

8
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,166
HOTCH IS MARRIED, MORGAN'S,
YOU KNOW, MORGAN.

9
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,266
WHAT'S THIS?

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,367
POLICE IN DAYTON, OHIO

11
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,667
NEED OUR HELP
WITH A SERIAL RAPIST.

12
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:31,700
WHAT'S THE STORY?

13
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:33,367
3 MONTHS AGO
HE RAPED 4 STUDENTS

14
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,233
AT A SMALL BIBLE COLLEGE.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,842
ROUGHLY, AN ATTACK A WEEK,
THEN SUDDENLY NOTHING,

16
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:41,673
UNTIL 9 DAYS AGO WHEN
HE SUDDENLY REAPPEARED

17
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:43,978
WITH A WHOLE
NEW VICTIM PATTERN.

18
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,998
BOTH THOSE WOMEN
ARE IN THEIR 30s.

19
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,800
THEY WERE RAPED
ABOUT 5 DAYS APART.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,754
WHERE HAVE THE NEW
ATTACKS TAN PLACE?

21
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:52,558
OPPOSITE ENDS
OF THE CITY.

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,312
HE WAS WAITING FOR THEM
WHEN THEY GOT HOME.

23
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:58,477
HOW DO WE KNOW
IT'S THE SAME GUY?

24
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:00,154
HE LEAVES VOICE MAILS
FOR THEM.

25
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:03,100
FREEZING THEM WITH FEAR
BEFORE THEY EVEN SEE HIM.

26
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,600
THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE
THE VOICE?

27
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:05,999
NO.

28
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,216
COPS EVEN HAVE DNA, BUT IT'S
JUST NOT IN THE SYSTEM.

29
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:11,600
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
ATTACKING COLLEGE STUDENTS
SUDDENLY WIDEN HIS NET?

30
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,899
SERIAL RAPISTS HARDLY
EVER CHANGE VICTIMOLOGY
ONCE IT'S ESTABLISHED.

31
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:17,178
IT'S BASED ON A FANTASY
THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC.

32
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,511
MAYBE HE'S TELLING THESE
WOMEN THAT NO ONE'S SAFE.

33
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,467
CALL HOTCH AND MORGAN.

34
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,866
TELL THEM WE'RE UP
AS SOON AS WE'RE
CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.

35
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:26,999
YES, SIR.

36
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:37,033
WELL, THANKS.

37
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,300
Man: I THINK WERE
READY TO MEET.

38
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,066
TRUST ME.

39
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:16,659
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

40
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:18,033
YOU CAME HOME EARLY TONIGHT.

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,024
AAH! NO! NO!

42
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,174
YOU TEND TO FORGET,
DON'T YOU?

43
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:16,320
WHAT?

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,913
ALL THE DIFFERENT MOODS
ON THE PLANE.

45
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,477
I THINK
THE MINDSET'S DIFFERENT

46
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:22,379
WHEN THE VICTIMS
ARE STILL ALIVE.

47
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,778
OK, WE GOT NEW INFORMATION
ON LAST NIGHT'S VICTIM.

48
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:27,422
ALICIA JORDAN, 38.

49
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,464
M.O. IS THE SAME.

50
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:29,597
HE WAS WAITING
FOR HER TO GET HOME,

51
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:32,122
HE BROKE IN THROUGH
THE BACK, SUBDUED HER
WITH A GUN.

52
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:32,897
ANSWERING MACHINE?

53
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,597
LEFT A MESSAGE ABOUT
AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE.

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,363
I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING
TAUNTED LIKE THAT IN MY
OWN HOUSE, YOU KNOW?

55
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,630
WELL, THE MESSAGES
AREN'T TAUNTS...

56
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:44,996
THEY'RE OVERTURES.

57
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,625
I THINK WE'RE READY,
TRUST ME.

58
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:49,864
HE'S BEING SINCERE.

59
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,597
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE
DEALING WITH A POWER
REASSURANCE RAPIST.

60
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,755
TO HIM THE MESSAGES
ARE COURTSHIPS.

61
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:57,430
HE'S INTRODUCING
HIMSELF TO THE VICTIMS.

62
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,033
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
HE MUST'VE STALKED THEM

63
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,931
TO KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

64
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:05,127
FIRST VICTIMS WERE ALL COLLEGE
STUDENTS, ALL RELIGIOUS.

65
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:07,255
WHY CHANGE?

66
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:09,718
HAVE THE POLICE FOUND
ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN
THE LATEST VICTIMS?

67
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:11,137
NO, NOTHING YET.

68
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:14,497
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT MADE HIM GO OFF SCRIPT.

69
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:28,598
MAGGIE CALLAHAN,
I'M THE DETECTIVE
ON THIS JOB.

70
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:29,933
HEY, JASON GIDEON,
HOW ARE YOU?

71
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:30,902
AARON HOTCHNER.

72
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:31,950
AS SOON
AS HE CHANGED VICTIMS

73
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,402
I KNEW I COULD USE
YOUR HELP.

74
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:35,459
YOUR THOUGHTS?

75
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,647
SERIAL RAPIST USUALLY
HAVE A SET FANTASY,

76
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:39,835
I FIGURED IF WE CAN
GET A HANDLE ON WHAT
MADE HIM CHANGE,

77
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:42,135
IT WOULD GIVE US
OUR BEST SHOT
AT NAILING THIS GUY.

78
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:44,340
IS THERE A PLACE WHERE
OUR TEAM COULD SET UP?

79
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,135
YOU GOT IT.
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

80
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,135
THANK YOU.

81
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,735
THANK YOU.

82
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:52,369
AGENT GIDEON, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO TALK
TO A LOT OF VICTIMS.

83
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,069
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
TO HAVE AN EXTRA
FEMALE PRESENCE.

84
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:57,835
CAN YOU PROMISE ME
YOU'LL BE SENSITIVE?

85
00:04:57,902 --> 00:05:00,202
AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE
ME TO STAY PISSED OFF AT
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.

86
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:02,935
I'VE BEEN ON THIS CASE
SINCE DAY ONE.

87
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,336
I DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO STEP ASIDE.

88
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:05,436
YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO.

89
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,535
THANK YOU.

90
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:13,135
CAN YOU ROLL OVER
TO YOUR OTHER SIDE PLEASE?

91
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,017
PULL YOUR GOWN DOWN
JUST A LITTLE--

92
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,336
EXCUSE US, PLEASE.

93
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:26,135
WE'RE FROM THE FBI.

94
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,468
I REALIZE YOU'VE ALREADY
SPOKEN TO THE POLICE,

95
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:29,870
BUT WE WERE HOPING YOU--

96
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,530
A FEW QUESTIONS YOU
COULD ANSWER FOR US.

97
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,666
YEAH. EVERY TIME
I THINK IT'S OVER

98
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,035
SOMEONE ELSE WANTS
TO PHOTOGRAPH ME

99
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,468
OR TOUCH ME OR
ASK ME TO RELIVE IT.

100
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:44,235
WE WILL KEEP THIS SHORT,
I PROMISE.

101
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:47,629
WHEN THE ATTACKS
FIRST STARTED,

102
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:50,635
THEY PUT GUARDS ON ALL
THE CAMPUS GATES ON CAMPUS.

103
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:53,515
BUT THAT MAN STILL SOMEHOW
GOT IN THE DORM ROOMS.

104
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:56,085
HAD YOU NOTICED
ANYONE NEW ON CAMPUS?

105
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,535
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

106
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:58,514
I KNOW IT'S HARD,

107
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:00,935
BUT SOMETIMES
IT HELPS TO GO
THROUGH IT.

108
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:03,052
MAYBE SOMEBODY QUIET,

109
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,768
WHO SEEMED LIKE
HE WAS ALWAYS JUST
A LITTLE TOO CLOSE.

110
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,169
I DON'T THINK SO.

111
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:11,235
WHAT ABOUT ANYONE THAT'S
SUDDENLY NOT AROUND ANYMORE?

112
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,501
BEFORE THAT MAN
DID WHAT HE DID

113
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:18,835
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD GET
A DOG FOR PROTECTION.

114
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,543
AND THEN HE SAID
OR MAYBE YOU CAN LET

115
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:23,169
YOUR PARENTS HAVE DEXTER
STAY WITH YOU.

116
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,768
YOU SAID THAT YOUR
ATTACKER KNEW THE THINGS

117
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,002
THAT YOU THOUGHT.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

118
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:35,002
HE SAID THAT WE WEREN'T THE
TYPE OF PEOPLE TO JUST STAY

119
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,235
INSIDE AND READ BOOKS,

120
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,302
AND HE TALKED ABOUT TAKING
ME AWAY TO POSITANO, ITALY,

121
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,166
AND DRINKING WHITE WINE
AND LISTENING TO AL GREEN.

122
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,540
IS THERE ANY
SIGNIFICANCE TO THAT?

123
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,022
MY FAVORITE PLACE
IN THE WORLD,

124
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:53,035
THE ONLY ALCOHOL I DRINK,
AND MY FAVORITE SINGER.

125
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:56,252
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
HE CAN KNOW ANY OF IT.

126
00:06:56,796 --> 00:07:00,169
ANY MALES IN YOUR LIFE
THAT YOU MAY HAVE TOLD
ABOUT THE FAMILY DOG?

127
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,635
I DON'T HAVE ANY
EXPERIENCE WITH BOYS.

128
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,702
THERE'S NO ONE
I WOULD'VE TOLD.

129
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,835
YOU NEED A SECOND?

130
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,260
IT'S HARD TO FOCUS
SOMETIMES.

131
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,764
I KNOW.

132
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,768
THE POLICE ALL ACT LIKE JUST
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KILL YOU,

133
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:33,057
HE DIDN'T SOMEHOW
END YOUR LIFE.

134
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:37,053
DID YOU TAKE MY ADVICE
AND TALK TO SOMEONE?

135
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,617
THERE'S ALWAYS A PRIEST
AVAILABLE ON CAMPUS.

136
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:41,265
I MEAN, A WOMAN.

137
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:44,169
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

138
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,202
SO MANY LIVES HAVE
BEEN RUINED HERE.

139
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:57,069
WHEN I WENT TO THE DOCTOR...

140
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:01,402
HE SAID THAT
MY INJURIES WERE MINOR.

141
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:07,702
AND YOU THINK
IF THEY WERE SOMEHOW WORSE,
IT WOULD BE BETTER?

142
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,802
I DON'T KNOW.

143
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,169
LOOK AT ME.

144
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:18,584
SOMEONE HANDS OVER A WALLET
AT GUNPOINT,

145
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:20,935
EVERYONE THINKS THAT'S
THE BEST THING TO DO.

146
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:24,416
YOU DID WHAT YOU
HAD TO DO TO SURVIVE.

147
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,950
DON'T LET ANYONE
TELL YOU DIFFERENT.

148
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:30,036
ALL RIGHT?

149
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,203
IT'S OK.

150
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,973
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LISTEN

151
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:39,550
TO THIS AND TELL ME
IF THE MAN'S ATTITUDE

152
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,568
SOUNDS THE SAME AS
WHEN HE WAS IN YOUR HOUSE.

153
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:45,106
Man: I THINK
WE'RE READY TO MEET.

154
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:46,735
TRUST ME.

155
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,369
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

156
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,238
HE SOUNDED DIFFERENT.

157
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,568
HOW SO?

158
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,402
MORE NERVOUS...

159
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,681
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD A GUN.

160
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,802
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS
AFRAID TO TALK.

161
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:03,069
THANK YOU.

162
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:06,069
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES
IT MATTER HOW HE SOUNDED?

163
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:07,635
ON THE PHONE HE CAN
REHEARSE,

164
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:10,802
AND IN THE FLESH HE CAN'T
HIDE HIS TRUE SELF.

165
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,568
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

166
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,768
IN HIS DELUSION,
THE MAN THINKS OF
THESE ATTACKS AS DATES.

167
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:21,348
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE HIM THINK THAT.

168
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,967
WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

169
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:26,175
THIS IS ENOUGH.

170
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:27,835
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

171
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:45,135
EVERYBODY GET SOME SLEEP.
WE'VE GOT A BIG DAY TOMORROW.

172
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,235
WHAT'S UP?

173
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:12,868
I THINK I LEFT MY GLASSES
IN THE CAR.

174
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,206
I'LL KEEP YOU COMPANY.

175
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,668
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT TO GET TO SLEEP.

176
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:13,535
BE RIGHT THERE.

177
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,735
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T
BE SLEEPING EITHER.

178
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:21,867
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

179
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:23,037
I TOOK A ROOM
ON THE HALL.

180
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:24,302
YOU LIVE 4 BLOCKS AWAY.

181
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:25,032
EXACTLY.

182
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,675
WHY BE SEPARATED
FROM THE WORK?

183
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:34,569
YOU STOLE THE BATHROBE?

184
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,909
COMPLIMENTARY.

185
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:41,402
I CAN'T GET SOMETHING
OUT OF MY HEAD.

186
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,269
CHERYL ON CAMPUS TODAY,

187
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:49,402
SHE SAID SO MANY LIVES
HERE HAVE BEEN RUINED.

188
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,214
YEAH?

189
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:55,002
ONLY 20% OF RAPES
ARE EVEN REPORTED.

190
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:59,601
YOU THINK THERE ARE
MORE VICTIMS OUT THERE?

191
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,349
YOU FIGURE
A CATHOLIC SCHOOL,

192
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:03,069
THE PERCENTAGES
ARE BOUND TO HOLD.

193
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:05,868
UNSUB'S COMMITTED A RAPE
THAT NEVER GOT REPORTED.

194
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,902
SOMETHING MADE
HIM CHANGE VICTIMS.

195
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,635
MAYBE HE ALMOST
GOT CAUGHT.

196
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:11,668
 MAYBE HE'S RELIGIOUS
 AND FELT GUILTY.

197
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:15,369
MAYBE A VICTIM REMINDED
HIM OF HIS SISTER.

198
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,069
SOMETHING.

199
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,660
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

200
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,848
I THINK YOU GOT
GOOD INSTINCTS.

201
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,436
HEY.

202
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,135
HI.

203
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:10,245
ARE YOU OK?

204
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:12,744
YEAH, WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

205
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:17,568
NO, REALLY, COME RIGHT IN.

206
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,868
YOU WANT TO CHECK MY I.D.?

207
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:30,188
I THOUGHT MAYBE...

208
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:33,002
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK.

209
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,552
DON'T GO ALL
PROFILER ON ME.

210
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,698
ELLE, YOU GOT SHOT
IN YOUR OWN HOME,

211
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:45,415
AND THEN YOU CAME
BACK TO THE BAU LIKE
NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED,

212
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:48,835
THINKING YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TALK ISN'T PROFILING YOU.

213
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:51,235
IT'S PSYCH 101.

214
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,935
PLEASE?

215
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,291
AFTER HE SHOT ME.

216
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,094
HE REACHED INTO MY WOUND

217
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,902
SO HE COULD WRITE
ON THE WALL IN MY BLOOD.

218
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,795
I WAS BARELY CONSCIOUS,

219
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:35,035
BUT I COULD FEEL
HIS HAND IN THERE...

220
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:39,702
AND SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE
I CAN STILL FEEL IT.

221
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:44,445
ELLE...

222
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,735
HE'S DEAD.

223
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,035
YOU'RE...YOU'RE RIGHT HERE.

224
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,483
YOU WON.

225
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:18,994
GOOD MORNING.

226
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:20,372
THANKS FOR COMING
IN A LITE EARLY.

227
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:22,570
GOOD MORNING.
LOUSY COFFEE'S UP.

228
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,472
WE JUST WANT YOU TO HEAR
WHAT THE FBI HAS GATHERED

229
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:26,960
AND GET YOU ON THE STREETS.

230
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:29,256
SO THE GUY
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

231
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:32,580
IS A CLASSIC POWER
REASSURANCE RAPIST.

232
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,808
THIS DIFFERS FROM
A POWER ASSERTIVE RAPIST

233
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,281
WHO ATTEMPTS TO HUMILIATE
AND TRAUMATIZE HIS VICTIMS,

234
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:38,981
AS WELL AS THE ANGER
RETALIATORY RAPIST

235
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:39,976
AND A SEXUAL SADIST,

236
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:42,984
WHOSE ATTACKS
ARE ALSO RANDOM AND
EXCESSIVELY BRUTAL.

237
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:44,490
THE REASON THAT'S
IMPORTANT FOR YOU

238
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,426
TO KNOW--HE'S
THE ONLY KIND OF RAPIST

239
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:48,743
WHO TARGETS
A SPECIFIC VICTIM.

240
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,147
HE FANTASIZES THAT
HE'S IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THESE WOMEN.

241
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:53,182
NOW, HE DOESN'T COME ACROSS
THEM BY ACCIDENT.

242
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:55,148
THIS IS SOMEONE WITH ACCESS.

243
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,648
HE'S THE CABLE GUY,
OR THE LOCKSMITH...

244
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:02,681
HE'S THE GUY WHO
READS THE GAS METER.

245
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:05,981
HE CAN DESCRIBE EXACTLY
WHAT THESE WOMEN WEAR
AND HOW THEY SMELL.

246
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,581
THESE DETAILS ARE
WHAT FEEDS HIS FANTASY.

247
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:11,512
NOW, WE NEED YOU
TO LOOK FOR THE OVERLAP
BETWEEN THE SETS OF VICTIMS.

248
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,015
DELIVERY MEN,
LA CREW, HANDYMEN--

249
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:15,750
DID THE SCHOOL
SHARE WORKERS WITH ANY
OF THE RECENT VICTIMS?

250
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,781
BECAUSE HE SEES
THESE AS RELATIONSHIPS,

251
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:19,514
HE MOST LIKELY
LIVES ALONE.

252
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:22,015
AND LIVING ALONE ALLOWS HIM
TO INDULGE HIS DELUSION

253
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,815
THAT HE'S IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THESE WOMEN.

254
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:25,979
BECAUSE
OF THE DISCREPANCY
IN THE VICTIMS' AGES.

255
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,931
WE CAN ONLY
PINPOINT HIS AGE

256
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:30,374
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
20 AND 40 YEARS OLD.

257
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:34,238
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
HE HAS A PROFESSION THAT
HE FINDS EMASCULATING,

258
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:35,781
SO LOOK FOR SOMEONE
IN THEIR LIVES

259
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:37,514
WITH A JOB THAT DEVIATES
FROM NORMAL GENDER ROLES,

260
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,381
SOMETHING LIKE
A SECRETARY.

261
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:41,717
WE'RE SURE THAT THERE
IS SOME OVERLAP.

262
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:45,477
THIS GUY IS A SHADOW
AT THE EDGES OF EACH
OF THESE WOMEN'S LIVES.

263
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:47,590
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
SQUARE ONE.

264
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,561
RECANVAS AND BE SURE
TO RELAY INFORMATION
ON SHIFT CHANGE.

265
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:52,481
THANKS VERY MUCH.

266
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,148
I LOOKED INTO
THE IDEA OF RAPES

267
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,613
THAT WENT UNREPORTED
LIKE YOU ASKED.

268
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:57,267
AND?

269
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,381
2 MONTHS AGO,
A FEMALE STUDENT

270
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,381
AT HOLY TRINITY
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

271
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:02,115
SHE WASN'T ONE OF
THE REPORTED VICTIMS,

272
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,989
BUT HER SUICIDE REPORT
CORRESPONDS ALMOST EXACTLY

273
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:07,148
TO WHEN THE CAMPUS
ATTACKS STOPPED.

274
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:12,581
MAYBE THERE ARE MORE
VICTIMS OUT THERE.

275
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:41,770
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW OUR DAUGHTER'S DEATH
IS FBI BUSINESS.

276
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,276
WE'RE INVESTIGATING A SERIES
OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS

277
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:46,282
THAT TOOK PLACE
ON SHELLY'S CAMPUS.

278
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:48,465
WERE YOU AWARE
OF THE ATTACKS?

279
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:50,833
OF COURSE.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

280
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:55,314
THERE'S NO GOOD WAY
TO SAY THIS, SO I'M
JUST GOING TO ASK.

281
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,681
IS IT POSSIBLE
THE SHELLY WAS RAPED,

282
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,848
AND THAT LED
TO HER SUICIDE?

283
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:02,248
NO, IT'S NOT.

284
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,315
DID SHELLY HAVE
ANY HISTORY OF DEPRESSION?

285
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:10,039
SHE PUT A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON HERSELF.

286
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:12,681
SHE GOT A'S,

287
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,815
VOLUNTEERED
WITH THE YOUTH GROUP,

288
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,405
PLAYED
VARSITY VOLLEYBALL
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

289
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,208
BUT SHE ALWAYS HANDLED
IT WITH GRACE.

290
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,073
DID SHE LEAVE A NOTE?

291
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:30,248
AND IF SO, WOULD IT BE
POSSIBLE FOR US TO TAKE
IT AND ANALYZE IT?

292
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:32,260
THERE WASN'T A NOTE.

293
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:37,465
WE WILL RETURN IT AND
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

294
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,366
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT I'M ASKING LIGHTLY.

295
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,676
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO YOU,
YOU WALK INTO MY HOME,

296
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,980
YOU ASK IF MY DAUGHTER,
WHO WE BURIED 2 MONTHS AGO,

297
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,693
WAS ALSO SEXUALLY VIOLATED.

298
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:46,914
I'M SORRY.

299
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:51,151
I HAVE A LITTLE GIRL AND
I CAN'T SAY HOW I'D REACT

300
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:52,391
IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HER,

301
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:54,019
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE
THAT I WOULD DO WHATEVER

302
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:57,517
WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE
THAT NO OTHER FAMILY WENT
THROUGH THAT SAME PAIN.

303
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:01,151
I'D LIKE TO GO LIE DOWN.

304
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:05,660
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

305
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:09,965
I'LL SEE YOU OUT.

306
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:28,737
I LOVE MY WIFE.

307
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:31,814
I'M SURE YOU DO.

308
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:38,547
SHE WAS RAPED.

309
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:41,027
THE UNSUB
GOT HER PREGNANT.

310
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:44,696
"I'M CHOOSING
THE SIN OF SUICIDE OVER
THE SIN OF ABORTION,

311
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:47,339
"BECAUSE I CAN'T BRING
HIS BABY INTO THE WORLD.

312
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,202
PLEASE DON'T HATE ME,
SHELLY."

313
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:50,953
THE ATTACKS AT THE COLLEGE
STOPPED TWO MONTHS AGO,

314
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:52,157
RIGHT AFTER
SHELLY'S SUICIDE.

315
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,644
THAT HAD HAVE BEEN
THE STRESSOR.

316
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,795
HE THINKS OF THESE
AS RELATIONSHIPS.

317
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,441
IN HIS MIND SHELLY
KILLED THEIR BABY.

318
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,382
JASON, HOTCH.

319
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:03,748
WE NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE LAST VICTIM AND
ASK ONE MORE QUESTION.

320
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:08,591
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU ABOUT
CHILDREN, FAMILY?

321
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:09,979
NO.

322
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:12,681
DID HE MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT SUICIDE?

323
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:15,081
REFER TO A PERSONAL TRAGEDY,

324
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,651
SOMEBODY HE WAS MAYBE
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH?

325
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,242
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME THIS?

326
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:23,029
ONE OF THE VICTIMS
TOOK HER OWN LIFE

327
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,465
WHEN SHE REALIZED THE RAPIST
GOT HER PREGNANT.

328
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,813
WHAT IS IT?

329
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,801
I'M TRYING
TO HAVE A BABY.

330
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:39,881
FOR HOW LONG?

331
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:41,948
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT
AT THE CLINIC

332
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:46,048
TO TALK ABOUT
INSEMINATION A FEW DAYS
BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED.

333
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,286
DID ANYONE ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

334
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:51,792
I JUST DECIDED.

335
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,384
I'M 38.

336
00:20:56,391 --> 00:20:58,714
I FIGURED I COULDN'T AFFORD
TO JUST WAIT AROUND

337
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:00,614
FOR THE RIGHT MAN
TO SHOW UP.

338
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:11,720
HEY.

339
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:13,447
I TALKED THE OTHER
2 VICTIMS IN THEIR 30s.

340
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:15,135
THEY HAD BOTH GONE
TO A FERTILITY CLINIC

341
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,861
WITHIN 5 DAYS
OF THEIR ATTACK.

342
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:18,502
SAME ONE EACH TIME?
YEP.

343
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:20,559
HAVE GARCIA RUN DOWN
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS.

344
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,825
THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING
AT SOMEONE WHO WORKS THERE

345
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,719
OR WHO HAS ACCESS
TO THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS.

346
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,490
YOU GOT IT.

347
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,347
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THE 5 DAYS?

348
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:28,582
THE MOST POPULAR FERTILITY
DRUG IS CLOMIPHENE,

349
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:30,407
AND THE CLINIC WOULD MOST
LIKELY HAVE A POLICY

350
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:33,314
NOT TO ATTEMPT
INSEMINATION UNTIL THE DRUG
REGIMEN IS COMPLETE.

351
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:35,792
SO THEN GETTING
THERE BEFORE THEY BEGIN
THE INSEMINATION PROCESS

352
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,315
WOULD GUARANTEE
THE UNSUB PATERNITY.

353
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:38,560
HE'S TRYING
TO GET THEM PREGNANT.

354
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,915
HE HASN'T
CHANGED HIS FANTASY,

355
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:41,424
HE'S MERELY FOUND A WAY
TO PERFECT IT.

356
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:43,180
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
A CHANGE IN VICTIMOLOGY.

357
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,781
HE'S TARGETED YOUNG,
ULTRA-RELIGIOUS GIRLS,

358
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:47,103
WHO HE ASSUMED WOULDN'T WANT
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

359
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:48,781
SO WHEN SHELLY KILLED HERSELF,

360
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:51,714
HE DECIDED CHANGE IT UP
AND GO AFTER WOMEN WHO WERE
DESPERATE TO HAVE A BABY.

361
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:55,416
THE UNSUB KNEW SHELLY
NORVELL WAS PREGNANT,

362
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:59,220
MEANS HE'S STILL WATCHING
HIS PAST VICTIMS.

363
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:08,741
ELLE, TALK TO CALLAHAN,

364
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:11,259
TELL THEM WE NEED PATROLS
MONITORING EVERYONE
ON THAT VICTIM LIST.

365
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:11,948
GOT IT.

366
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:15,598
YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE?

367
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:16,981
GARY HEIDNICK
IN PHILADELPHIA.

368
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:19,630
HE KEPT WOMEN IN A DUNGEON
PRISON FOR YEARS

369
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,115
WITH THE HOPES
OF IMPREGNATING THEM.

370
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:22,414
HEIDNICK WAS
A SEXUAL SADIST.

371
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:23,748
HE TORTURED THE WOMEN

372
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:25,382
AND EVEN ENDED UP
EATING ONE OF THEM.

373
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:27,215
THIS IS A POWER
REASSURANCE RAPIST.

374
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:29,282
SO IN THIS
GUY'S TWISTED MIND,
THESE ARE LOVE STORIES?

375
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,748
OF COURSE, THEY ARE.

376
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,681
HE'S STARTING FAMILIES.

377
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:46,452
I'M SORRY, BUT WHOEVER'S
COMMITTING THESE CRIMES

378
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:47,559
COULDN'T WORK
AT THIS CLINIC.

379
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,792
iN
I'M THE ONLY MAN HERE.

380
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,725
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION.

381
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:53,292
WE NEED YOUR HELP TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE.

382
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:55,592
COULD YOU EXCUSE ME,
JUST A MINUTE?

383
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:57,818
CAN YOU JUST FILL
THAT OUT?

384
00:22:57,818 --> 00:22:59,798
THAT'S GREAT.
JUST RIGHT THERE.

385
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:04,039
LOOK, WHAT'S HAPPENING
IS JUST HORRIBLE,

386
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:07,396
BUT THE MARGINS
ON THE CLINIC LIKE THIS
ARE INCREDIBLY SLIM.

387
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:10,492
AND IF WORD GETS OUT THERE'S
A CONNECTION TO THIS RAPIST,

388
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,887
MY PRACTICE WOULD BE RUINED.

389
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:13,744
TO BE HONEST I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR PRACTICE.

390
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,454
3 WOMEN WERE RAPED
AFTER COMING HERE.

391
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:17,733
THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
IT'S A PATTERN.

392
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:21,026
IF YOU'RE IMPLYING THAT
I COULD BE A SUSPECT.

393
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:24,325
I SHOULD LET YOU KNOW
THAT I HAD A VASECTOMY
25 YEARS AGO.

394
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:25,785
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF THERE'S ANYONE

395
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:28,371
IN AND OUT OF THIS CLINIC
WHO FITS THE PROFILE.

396
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:31,361
QUIET, LIVES ALONE,
AWKWARD WITH WOMEN,

397
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:32,128
YET HANGS AROUND
THE OFFICE

398
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:34,231
A LITTLE TOO LONG JUST
TO BE NEAR THEM.

399
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:36,054
NO, IT'S JUST A SMALL CLINIC.

400
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:37,525
I ONLY HIRE WOMEN.

401
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:40,225
MY PATIENTS ARE JUST MUCH
MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND THEM.

402
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:43,696
WHAT ABOUT ELSEWHERE,
COMPUTER SUPPORT, JANITOR?

403
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:47,536
MY DAUGHTER HANDLES ALL
OF THE TECHNICAL BUSINESS

404
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:51,026
AND I HAVE A CLEANING
CREW OF TWO WOMEN.

405
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:52,724
SORRY.

406
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,191
WHAT IS THAT, DOCTOR?

407
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:55,443
IT'S JUST A QUESTIONNAIRE

408
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:58,225
WE HAND OUT TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT OUR CLIENT BASE.

409
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,902
THIS IS EVERYTHING THE UNSUB
KNEW ABOUT THE VICTIMS.

410
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,656
WHO ELSE SEES THESE?

411
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:15,091
I DON'T COMPROMISE THE MEDICAL
PRIVACY OF MY PATIENTS.

412
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:17,026
WHELSE SEES THESE?

413
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:20,292
WELL, I SELL THE FORMS TO
A DIRECT MARKETING COMPANY

414
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,525
CALLED FIRST HAND MEDIA.

415
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:23,125
THEY JUST TARGET
BUYING HABITS.

416
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,936
NO MEDICAL INFORMATION
CHANGES HANDS.

417
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:29,534
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

418
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,712
YEAH, BUT THE MARGINS
ON A PLACE LIKE THIS,

419
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:34,776
WORD GETS OUT, YOUR
PRACTICE WOULD BE RUINED.

420
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,909
DAYTON, OHIO.
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

421
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:43,371
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A REQUEST.

422
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,592
WITH THAT SULTRY VOICE?

423
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:45,725
YOU NAME IT.

424
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,125
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

425
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:49,659
IT'S A MARKETING FIRM
BY THE NAME
OF FIRST HAND MEDIA.

426
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,125
I WANT YOU TO SEE IF
THEY HAVE ANY CONNECTION

427
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,125
TO THE COLLEGES FROM THE
FIRST SET OF VICTIMS.

428
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,054
BEHOLD, FIRST HAND
MEDIA PROCESSES

429
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:58,499
ALL THE FRESHMAN ORIENTATION
QUESTIONNAIRES.

430
00:24:58,499 --> 00:24:59,699
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

431
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,337
OH, ONE LAST FAVOR.

432
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:03,332
LOOK UP THE WORDS
SEXY AND BRILLIANT

433
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:05,716
IN THAT COMPUTER
OF YOURS AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU COME UP WITH.

434
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:09,157
LOOK AT THAT, IT'S ME.

435
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:11,742
YOU ARE A GODDESS
WOMAN, CIAO.

436
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:16,970
IT WAS A...

437
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,309
IT WAS A WORK CALL.

438
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:26,282
YOU REALLY THINK THIS RAPIST
IS ONE OF MY GUYS?

439
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:29,971
WELL, HE'S USED TO BEING
IN STRANGERS' HOMES,
ALWAYS ON THE PHONE.

440
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:31,341
THAT'S HOW
HE'S CONFIDENT.

441
00:25:31,758 --> 00:25:34,390
THANKS TO YOUR RESEARCH,
HE FEELS LIKE HE KNOWS
THESE WOMEN.

442
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,992
CREATE A LIST OF ANY
EMPLOYEES YOU HAVE

443
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:39,029
THAT WORKED IN A FERTILITY
CLINIC AND UNIVERSITY
QUTIONNAIRES.

444
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:42,600
I GIVE EVERY
EMPLOYEE COMPLETE ACCESS
TO ALL OF OUR MATERIALS.

445
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:45,591
IT HELPS KEEP THEM FRESH
IF THEY CAN ALTERNATE
BETWEEN TYPES OF CALLS.

446
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:47,905
SO I FILL OUT MY INTIMATE
PERSONAL INFORMATION

447
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:49,692
AND THEN YOU JUST
SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE

448
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,557
YOU HAVE WORKING HERE
FOR MINIMUM WAGE?

449
00:25:51,557 --> 00:25:53,104
I SENSE AN ATTITUDE.

450
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:55,802
WE NEED COPIES OF EVERY
SINGLE QUESTIONNAIRE

451
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:57,463
THAT YOU GOT
FROM THE CLINIC.

452
00:25:57,872 --> 00:26:00,558
WE CAN GET A WARRANT
HERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR
IF YOU PREFER.

453
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:02,725
LOOK, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

454
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:05,132
ALL I'M DOING IS PROFILING,
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.

455
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:06,703
LET'S NOT THINK
ABOUT IT.

456
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:23,378
ALL THESE?

457
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:25,361
WE COVER THE ENTIRE
GREAT LAKES REGION.

458
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:25,978
LET'S NARROW IT DOWN.

459
00:26:25,978 --> 00:26:27,833
THE GUY WE'RE LOOKING
FOR IS A MALE, WHITE,

460
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,194
BETWEEN THE AGES
OF 20 AND 40,

461
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:30,325
SOCIALLY AWKWARD,
UNABLE TO MAKE--

462
00:26:30,392 --> 00:26:31,525
CONNECTIONS EASILY.

463
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,813
I HAVE 250 EMPLOYEES.

464
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:35,116
MOST OF THOSE ARE MEN

465
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:36,225
AND EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THEM MATCH

466
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:37,959
THE DESCRIPTION
YOU JUST GAVE ME.

467
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:46,299
WOW. I HEARD YOU RAN
INTO A WALL OF PAPER.

468
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:49,637
YOU CAN LOCK YOUR DOORS,
BUT THESE PEOPLE STILL FIND
A WAY INTO YOUR HOME.

469
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,692
ELLE, IT MIGHT BE WORTH
GOING BACK TO THE VICTIMS.

470
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,258
IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT MAYBE SOMEBODY REMEMBERS

471
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:55,525
A FIRST NAME
FROM A TELEMARKETING CALL.

472
00:26:55,525 --> 00:26:57,652
YEAH, THE UNSUB FEELS
A CONNECTION WITH THEM.

473
00:26:57,652 --> 00:26:59,725
SO HE WOULDN'T LIE
OR USE AN ALIAS.

474
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:02,907
WE KNOW THIS GUY'S DNA
IS NOT IN THE SYSTEM,

475
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:04,191
BUT I'LL CROSS-CHECK
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS

476
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:06,191
AGAINST SEXUAL
MISDEMEANORS:
PEEPING, EXPOSURE.

477
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,892
GOOD.

478
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,659
SEPARATE DATA FORMS
FROM THE REST OF THE REGION.

479
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:15,303
SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW
FROM THE LATEST SET
OF VICTIMS?

480
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,110
THEY'RE ALL SINGLE
AND ALL OVER 35.

481
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,325
EACH OF THEM ALSO INDICATED
RECENTLY BUYING BOOKS

482
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:23,681
ON BABIES AND CHILDBEARING.

483
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:25,685
SO HE KNOWS
THEY'RE COMMITTED
TO HAVING CHILDREN,

484
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,158
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE MUCH
LESS LIKELY TO ABORT,

485
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:28,838
EVEN IN THE CASE
OF RAPE.

486
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:30,392
GET THIS, EACH OF
THE VICTIMS ALSO CHECKED

487
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,963
THE YES BOX WHEN ASKED IF IT
WOULD BE OK TO CONTACT THEM

488
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:35,826
ON SPECIAL DEALS
ON PEDIATRIC ITEMS.

489
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,316
IN THE UNSUB'S MIND
THEY'VE CONSENTED.

490
00:27:38,316 --> 00:27:40,463
HE THINKS HE'S DOING THEM
A SERVICE.

491
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:42,392
CHECK THOSE FORMS FOR
EACH OF THOSE ELEMENTS.

492
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,458
IF WE CAN NARROW
IT DOWN TO A POTENTIAL
LIST OF VICTIMS

493
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:46,191
WE CAN BE WAITING
FOR HIM.

494
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,576
ANY HITS?

495
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:53,725
GOT ONE.
REID?

496
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,425
NOTHING.

497
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:56,975
IT'S THE ONLY ONE?

498
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:57,725
IT'S A SMALL CITY.

499
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:59,325
THERE CAN'T BE VERY
MANY SINGLE WOMEN

500
00:27:59,392 --> 00:28:01,596
IN THEIR LATE 30s
GOING TO THE EXACT SAME
FERTILITY CLINIC.

501
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,091
SO, WE KNOW WHO HE'S
GOING AFTER NEXT.

502
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:18,386
???????

503
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,147
??????????????

504
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:13,574
THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY.

505
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:15,070
WE'RE STILL NOT
SURE HOW HE GOT IN.

506
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,507
M.O.'S THE SAME?
NO.

507
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:18,674
I'M GOING TO TAKE
A LOOK INSIDE.

508
00:29:19,448 --> 00:29:20,941
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOUR MEN DOING?

509
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:21,792
EXCUSE ME?

510
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,590
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE MEN
OUTSIDE THE DOOR,

511
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,617
BUT A WOMAN CAN STILL
GET RAPED INSIDE.

512
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,040
THEY KNOCKED,
THERE WAS NO ANSWER,

513
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,774
THERE WAS NO LEGAL
CAUSE TO ENTER.

514
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:29,939
SO, THEY JUST WALKED AWAY?

515
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:31,440
NO, THEY LEFT MESSAGES
THAT IT WAS URGENT

516
00:29:31,507 --> 00:29:32,693
SHE CONTACT THE POLICE.

517
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:33,856
WHICH MUST BE
ON THE MACHINE

518
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,351
RIGHT AFTER THAT CREEP
LEFT A MESSAGE

519
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:36,706
SAYING HE WAS GOING
TO RAPE HER.

520
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,574
THEY DID EVERYTHING
IN THEIR POWER.

521
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:40,807
YOU JUST KEEP
TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

522
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:42,008
ELLE.

523
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:46,173
EXCUSE ME. HOW BAD
WERE HER INJURIES?

524
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,714
SHE'S LUCKY. THEY'RE
RELATIVELY MINOR.

525
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:51,550
DO ME A FAVOR,
DON'T TELL HER
THAT SHE'S LUCKY.

526
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,641
THERE'S NOT
A POTENTIAL VICTIM
IN THE QUESTIONNAIRES.

527
00:29:56,405 --> 00:29:58,474
WHO KNOWS WHEN
WE'RE GOING TO GET
ANOTR SHOT AT HIM.

528
00:29:58,541 --> 00:29:59,585
THE NOOSE IS TIGHTENING.

529
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:01,151
YOU SAW THAT
STACK OF FORMS.

530
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:04,008
THIS COMPANY
HANDLES THE ENTIRE
GREAT LAKES REGION.

531
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:05,774
IF HE THINKS WE'RE
CLOSE, HE CAN TAKE OFF

532
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:08,807
AND HE'S GOT A WHOLE
NEW LIST OF VICTIMS
IN ANOTHER CITY.

533
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:11,040
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

534
00:30:11,107 --> 00:30:14,269
WHAT HE STARTED
WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS,
HE RAPED ONE A WEEK.

535
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:17,474
NOW, HE HAS TO WAIT
FOR THE RIGHT SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES,

536
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,474
BUT HE WANTS
MORE VICTIMS.

537
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,841
LET'S GIVE HIM ONE.

538
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,974
YOU THINK ELLE'S
READY FOR IT?

539
00:30:24,412 --> 00:30:25,774
WE'LL BE THERE FOR HER.

540
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,159
WHAT'S MY STORY?

541
00:30:36,636 --> 00:30:39,442
YOU'RE A LEGAL SECRETARY,
36, DIVORCED.

542
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:41,655
BACK THERE, THE
QUESTIONNAIRE'S 2 DAYS.

543
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:44,994
SO IN THE UNSUB'S MIND
HE'S ALREADY BEHIND
HIS NORMAL SCHEDULE.

544
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:47,479
THIS GUY'S ITCHING FOR
ANOTHER VICTIM, THOUGH.

545
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,851
ONCE HE SEES THAT FORM
HE'S GOING TO WANT
TO STAKE YOU OUT.

546
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:51,307
YOU NEED TO LET HIM SEE YOU.

547
00:30:51,374 --> 00:30:52,607
HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHEN YOU LEAVE,

548
00:30:52,674 --> 00:30:54,207
WHEN YOU COME HOME,
WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS OVER.

549
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:57,541
HE BREAKS INTO THESE HOUSES
WHEN THE WOMEN ARE AWAY.

550
00:30:57,607 --> 00:30:59,040
SO, HE NEEDS
TO SEE YOU LEAVE.

551
00:31:03,474 --> 00:31:05,719
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS GET HIM
TO BREACH THAT DOOR.

552
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,185
ONCE WE GOT HIM
ON BREAKING AND ENTERING,

553
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:09,674
WE GOT REASON TO GET DNA
AND HIS ASS IS OURS.

554
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:12,040
ANOTHER THING, DON'T
GO OUT WITH YOUR GUN.

555
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:13,173
IT'S TOO RISKY.

556
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,574
IF HE SEES IT,
WE MIGHT LOSE HIM.

557
00:31:15,383 --> 00:31:18,207
KEEP IT SOMEPLACE INSIDE SO
YOU CAN GET TO IT EASILY.

558
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:19,149
I'M GOING TO BE
RIGHT OUT FRONT,

559
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:21,545
HOTCH AND GIDEON
WILL BE AROUND THE CORNER
IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN.

560
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:22,707
AND, DON'T FORGET
YOU'RE WIRED,

561
00:31:22,774 --> 00:31:25,167
SO WE'LL BE WITH YOU
AT ALL TIMES.

562
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,259
HEY, YOU GOOD?

563
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:31,811
I'M GOOD.

564
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:05,841
SHE'S IN.

565
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:06,774
WHY ISN'T SHE LEAVING?

566
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:08,674
SHE NEEDS TO GET
OUT OF THERE.

567
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:28,863
WHAT IS THAT?

568
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:37,245
MORGAN, CALL HER.

569
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:58,741
COME ON, PICK UP.
PICK UP.

570
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:14,707
I THINK WE MIGHT
HAVE COMPANY.

571
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:30,307
TALK TO ME, TIGER.

572
00:34:30,474 --> 00:34:32,440
GARCIA, I NEED YOU
TO RUN A PLATE FOR ME.

573
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,919
??????????????????????

574
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:43,222
WILLIAM LEE,
10308 PINEHURST AVENUE.

575
00:34:43,222 --> 00:34:45,022
OK, CAN YOU GIVE ME
WHERE HE WORKS?

576
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:47,100
FEEL MY SPEED.

577
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:57,107
HE WORKS
FOR FIRST HAND MEDIA.

578
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:58,507
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
THANKS.

579
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,641
IT'S HIM.

580
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:33,466
BINGO.

581
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,173
ALPHA, BRAVO,
SHE'S ON THE MOVE.

582
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:42,807
WHAT'S SHE DOING
WITH HER GUN OUT?

583
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,574
JUST GET IN THE CAR.

584
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:58,172
DON'T LET HIM KNOW
THAT YOU SEE HIM.

585
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:00,440
WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING?
EASY, BABY.

586
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,841
SHE'S PANICKING.
EASY, EASY.

587
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:05,240
COME ON, ELLE. BACK OFF.

588
00:36:05,307 --> 00:36:07,308
BACK OFF. WE'VE GOT NO
REASON TO BRINHIM IN.

589
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:09,346
DON'T BLOW IT,
DON'T BLOW IT.

590
00:36:11,474 --> 00:36:13,741
GO, GO, GO!
EVERYBODY, GO.

591
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:17,028
FBI, PUT YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

592
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:18,730
GET OUT OF THE CAR!

593
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,716
??????/
???????

594
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:22,704
PUT YOUR PALMS UP!

595
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:24,310
SHUT UP!

596
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:31,307
I WAS JUST STOPPING
TO LOOK AT MY MAP.

597
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,549
YOU GOT NO REASON
TO KEEP ME HERE.

598
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:57,953
WE KNOW YOU WORK
AT FIRST HAND MEDIA

599
00:36:57,953 --> 00:37:01,186
AND YOU HAD ACCESS
TO INFORMATION ABOUT
ALL THESE WOMEN.

600
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:04,327
BUT I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

601
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:05,719
WE KNOW THAT.

602
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:09,086
I APOLOGIZE.

603
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,754
WE KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CARE
ABOUT THESE WOMEN.

604
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,919
YOU DO CARE ABOUT THEM,
DON'T YOU?

605
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,664
HE'S 28 YEARS OLD AND HAS
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA,

606
00:37:20,664 --> 00:37:23,398
BUT HE'S HAD 12 JOBS
IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.

607
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,219
HOME LIFE?

608
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:25,585
HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER
UNTIL SHE WAS DIAGNOSED

609
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:27,869
WITH PANCREATIC CANCER
6 MONTHS AGO.

610
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:32,082
ONE LAST CHANCE
TO MAKE MAMA PROUD,
BY STARTING A FAMILY.

611
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:33,558
HOW ARE THEY PLAYING IT?

612
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:34,992
DEEP EMPATHY.

613
00:37:34,992 --> 00:37:35,702
SMART.

614
00:37:35,702 --> 00:37:36,751
YEAH. WELL,
IT BETTER WORK.

615
00:37:36,752 --> 00:37:37,904
IF THEY DON'T
GET HIM TO CONFESS,

616
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:39,392
WE GOT NO REASON
TO HOLD HIM.

617
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:43,758
WE KNOW THAT DATING THOSE
YOUNGER GIRLS WAS A MISTAKE.

618
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:46,878
THEY WERE JUST TOO IMMATURE.

619
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:49,714
OLDER ONES ARE--

620
00:37:50,908 --> 00:37:52,342
THEY'RE LOOKING
TO START FAMILIES.

621
00:37:52,442 --> 00:37:55,605
THEY'RE EVEN WILLING
TO SHELL OUT A LOT OF MONEY
JUST TO HAVE KIDS.

622
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:00,118
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
THAT'S TRUE,

623
00:38:00,118 --> 00:38:01,987
THEN WHOEVER WOULD
HAVE BEEN WITH THEM

624
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:03,288
WOULD'VE BEEN HELPING.

625
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:05,500
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE SAYING.

626
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:07,952
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO THEM.

627
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,505
WHO'S THIS?

628
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:17,060
NO, NO, NO, NO.

629
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,528
SON OF A BITCH.

630
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:20,715
WHY DON'T YOU VOLUNTEER
A DNA SAMPLE?

631
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:23,684
IF YOU'RE THE KID,

632
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:26,353
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO YOUR FATHER WAS?

633
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:31,901
DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD.

634
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:33,519
THIS IS OVER.

635
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:35,899
I'M ADVISING MY CLIENT
NOT TO ANSWER
ANY MORE QUESTIONS.

636
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:39,786
I'M ASSUMING
THAT WE'RE FREE TO GO.

637
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,748
YOU'RE LETTING HIM WALK?

638
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:52,422
BACK OFF, ELLE.

639
00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:53,873
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DONE.

640
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,077
THE ONLY REASON HE'S WALKING
IS BECAUSE YOU PANICKED.

641
00:38:56,077 --> 00:38:58,997
I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'VE GOT MY BACK?

642
00:38:58,997 --> 00:38:59,909
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO ME?

643
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:02,187
THE LAST TIME YOU SENT ME
HOME HOTCH IT GOT ME SHOT.

644
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:04,046
WALK WITH ME, RIGHT NOW.

645
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:14,765
YOU NEED TO GET SOME AIR.

646
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:20,880
WHILE YOU DO, I WANT YOU
TO THINK ABOUT THIS JOB,

647
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:24,220
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

648
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:27,808
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

649
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,464
SO, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

650
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:51,881
DO YOU STAY?

651
00:39:51,882 --> 00:39:54,167
YOU HAVE YOUR MAN,
YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT
FOR HIM TO SLIP UP.

652
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:54,810
YOU SAID YOURSELF,

653
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,884
HE HAS ACCESS
TO INFORMATION ON WOMEN
FOR AN 8-STATE REGION.

654
00:39:57,884 --> 00:40:02,284
LOOK, YOU'RE A GOOD COP,
MY MONEY'S ON YOU.

655
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:05,484
GET SOME REST,
MY FRIEND.

656
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:08,083
WHEEL'S UP TOMORROW
AT NOON.

657
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,651
IS THIS WHAT YOU DO?

658
00:40:33,043 --> 00:40:35,877
YOU WAIT FOR THEM
UNTIL THEY GET HOME?

659
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:42,484
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

660
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:45,217
WHAT, YOU CAN'T TALK
TO A WOMAN WITHOUT
A GUN IN YOU HAND?

661
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:47,584
YOU AND I BOTH
KNOW WHAT YOU ARE

662
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:49,684
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HURT WOMEN ANYMORE.

663
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:53,350
I WOULD NEVER HURT THEM,
YOU KNOW THAT.

664
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:54,751
ds
THAT'S WHY
YOU LET ME GO.

665
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:56,717
I DIDN'T LET
YOU DO ANYTHING.

666
00:41:01,384 --> 00:41:03,217
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.

667
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:05,083
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?

668
00:41:06,158 --> 00:41:08,984
WHY DO YOU CHOOSE
TO DO A JOB THAT
IS SO DANGEROUS?

669
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,083
YOU SHOULD FIND A MAN
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

670
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,684
OH, LIKE YOU TOOK CARE
OF THOSE WOMEN?

671
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,817
NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO INTERROGATE ME.

672
00:41:16,703 --> 00:41:18,551
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

673
00:41:19,204 --> 00:41:20,851
I'M JUST HERE
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT

674
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:24,050
I'M NOT GOING TO REST
UNTIL YOU GO AWAY.

675
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:30,147
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU
WANT ME TO SAY THANK YOU.

676
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:31,551
YOU'RE SICK.

677
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:32,717
REALLY?

678
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:36,517
BECAUSE...

679
00:41:36,884 --> 00:41:39,751
WITHOUT YOU I WOULD
STILL BE LOCKED UP.

680
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,884
I DIDN'T LET YOU WALK.

681
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,484
THANK YOU.

682
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,784
YOU'VE MADE A LOT
OF WOMEN VERY HAPPY.

683
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,817
HEY, LEE.

684
00:42:42,036 --> 00:42:43,084
WHAT HAPPENED?

685
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,043
I WAS HAVING
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM

686
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:47,183
AND HE DREW HIS WEAPON
AND I FIRED.

687
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,179
YOU ALL RIGHT?

688
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,161
??????????

689
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,055
CAN'T LET YOU SPEAK TO HER

690
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:56,454
UNTIL SHE'S
BEEN PROCESSED.

691
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:57,296
PROCEDURE.

692
00:42:57,296 --> 00:42:58,016
WHAT HAPPENED?

693
00:42:58,016 --> 00:42:59,585
SHE CAME TO STAKE
HIS PLACE OUT,

694
00:42:59,585 --> 00:43:01,284
HE SAW HER, HE HAD A GUN.

695
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,246
DON'T WORRY, IT'S CUT
AND DRY. SELF-DEFENSE.

696
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:06,317
SHE'LL HAVE HER BADGE
BACK BY TOMORROW.

697
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,918
THANK YOU.
