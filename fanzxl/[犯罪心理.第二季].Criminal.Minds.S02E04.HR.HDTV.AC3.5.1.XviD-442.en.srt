1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,980
*Don't you even think about it!

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,380
Back it up.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,550
Everybody,down!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,220
Everybody,down!

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,620
I said watch it.

6
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,470
I said watch it!

7
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,830
Please,don'T.

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,320
Over the past 2 months,

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,880
the L.A. Field office has been tracking a series of 4 bank robberies in the L.A. Metro area.

10
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,880
It's one individual wearing a black ski mask.

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,480
He's highly skilled.

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,550
It's his unique M.O.

13
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,350
That put him squarely in our court.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,650
This happened 2 days ago.

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,060
He's making them undress?

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,400
He takes their clothes and locks them in the vault,

17
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,800
then he goes for the cash.

18
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,860
Smart.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,760
Nobody's going to run after him buck-naked.

20
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,190
It's also a psychological advantage.

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,710
Make the captives feel exposed,intimidated,

22
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,400
and much less likely to fight back.

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,300
That,and the mac-10 he's waving around.

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,000
Boy's got a lot of firepower.

25
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,660
But why is this case for us?

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,910
Because in the last robbery,2 things changed.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,620
1,he beat the security guard nearly senseless,

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,890
and 2,after he made everyone undress,

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,820
he forced 2 pairs of victims together at gunpoint,

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,190
then he made them simulate sex with each other.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,900
Whoa.

32
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,260
It's remarkable.

33
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,990
By utilizing your practical M.O.

34
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,000
The subject has stumbled on to a psychological signature.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,900
It's fascinating.

36
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,540
He's a sex offender now.

37
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,170
Fueled by violent rage.

38
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,000
Only our unsub doesn't know it yet.

39
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,230
If he did,he wouldn't be robbing banks anymore.

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,220
So,he's a violent sex offender in denial.

41
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,540
And a sexual predator.

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,150
Who's just escalated his crimes.

43
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,280
He's a serial killer in the making.

44
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,820
criminal minds Season 02 Episode 04

45
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,840
Hey,what are you doing here?

46
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,900
Your cell phone kept going straight to voicemail.

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah,no,I was in a meeting.

48
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,310
Is everything all right?

49
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,090
Going out of town?

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,200
Yeah,we're going to L.A.

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,710
I was going to call you from the car.

52
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,460
What is it?

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,220
You really don't know why I'm here?

54
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,510
Honey,I'm sorry,

55
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,770
we're running late.

56
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,890
I just got back from the hospital.

57
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,730
Jack?

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,160
Oh,my god,the tests.

59
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,670
What happened?

60
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,950
He's got a condition.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,170
It's treatable and he's going to be ok.

62
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,500
Honey,I'm sorry.

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,070
How was he?

64
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,810
Scared.

65
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,920
You know,they put those electrodes all over him

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,570
and he was wondering where his daddy was.

67
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,290
-Babe,you promised you'd be there. -I know.

68
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,430
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,710
Where is he now?

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,710
At home with my mom 

71
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,450
I didn't want him here while we were talking.

72
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,540
Look,I know this job is important to you,

73
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,200
but we're important,too.

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,180
You don't have to tell me that.

75
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,610
I don't want you to wake up some day in some random city

76
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,810
and realize that you don't know your own son.

77
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,190
They can go without me.

78
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,220
No,they can'T.

79
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,430
It's ok.

80
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,180
Go.

81
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,670
We'll talk about it when you get home.

82
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,230
I'm so sorry.

83
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,550
sorry

84
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,720
"Man is least himself when he talks in his own person.

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,270
Give him a mask and he will tell you the truth."

86
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,930
Oscar wilde.

87
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,520
"Stripping bandiT."

88
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,930
That's terrible.That makes it sound like the bandit's doing the stripping.

89
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,110
What would you call him?

90
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,130
Pervert.

91
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,070
Scumbag.

92
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,710
-I'd call him an ass -hey,focus,please.

93
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,730
We have the details of the 4 bank robberies to learn before we get to los angeles.

94
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,090
At this point is he more a bank robber or a sex offender?

95
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,320
Seriously.What's he going to do next,rob a bank or rape somebody?

96
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,610
I'd say we need to know more about 

97
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,430
how he robs the banks and who he chooses to victimize.

98
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,940
Why these banks and why these victims?

99
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,890
Pairing these specific people together is a fantasy.

100
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,480
If we can figure out the nature of that fantasy,

101
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,420
we may be able to predict his targets.

102
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,680
Hmm.

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,020
In the last robbery I don't see any photos of what he made the victims actually do.

104
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,790
There is a problem with this surveillance system.

105
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,910
We're working on it.

106
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,000
We should hit the ground running.How should we break it down?

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,160
There's got to be a pattern to the banks.

108
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,450
We should run a geographical profile.

109
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,270
It's yours.

110
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,480
And for the sexual aspects,

111
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,750
we need to look at the specific victimology.

112
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,220
You and I can go with the victim reports,

113
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,020
see whatever surveillance footage they got.

114
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,450
We'll need the unsub himself.

115
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,120
We'll need his perspective.

116
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,730
Crime scene.

117
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,040
The suspect entered around 2:00 P.M.

118
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,170
And a witness said he saw a man on a motorcycle

119
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,470
with a backpack speed by a few minutes after the robbery.

120
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,410
Freeway's just a few blocks that way,right?

121
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,740
Actually,we're in a half-mile of 3 freeways.

122
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,050
This is a perfect location.

123
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,150
If he's on a bike,he's got no trouble getting out of here.

124
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,020
Well,first he's got to get to his bike.

125
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,170
Where's it parked?

126
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,410
-Not hidden anywhere. -No.

127
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,310
No. No.A guy this good wouldn't risk his bike not being near when he comes out.

128
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,380
He'd park illegally.

129
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,000
Probably not in the parking lot,

130
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,500
but further down the block,maybe,

131
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,600
or right across the street here.

132
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,610
We need to know if any of these places have security cameras that might have caught the bike.

133
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,040
Ready?

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,530
Let's go rob a bank. 

135
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
Basically,

136
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,330
we assume the suspects will hunt close to where they live,

137
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,060
but far enough to remain anonymous.

138
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,610
Each one of these data points represents a bank that he hit,

139
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,800
and this area where the lines intersect give us the best estimate of the unsub's home.

140
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,170
So,how many does that narrow it down to?

141
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,170
Uh,couple hundred thousand.

142
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
Oh.

143
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,860
Witness statements.

144
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,400
Not planning on seeing any of the sights this afternoon,were you?

145
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,540
I've already seen the hollywood sign,

146
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,650
been to the getty center,

147
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm not really interested in john wayne's footprints,

148
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,890
so I guess that covers the sights of los angeles.

149
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,720
Oh. Let me guess,new york?

150
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,380
Now,what would make you say that?

151
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,750
Is this all the video equipment you've got?

152
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,440
It ain't quanico.

153
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,680
I need to set up a link with our tech back there.

154
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,830
We got another bay as crappy as this one down the hall.

155
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,240
You all right?

156
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,670
I just need some popcorn.

157
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,750
Have fun.

158
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,300
So,he enters and he walks right to this spot.

159
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,440
Pulls his weapon and shoots into the ceiling right there.

160
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,210
That gets everyone's attention,

161
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,890
let's them all know he's dead serious.

162
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,730
Efficient.

163
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,420
This is the best spot in the bank.

164
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,190
I can see all the tellers,the front door,

165
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,070
and that's the back office over there.

166
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,120
So,he knew exactly where to go.

167
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,160
He had been here before.

168
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,440
Next.

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,780
Next,he turns,aims the gun at the guard.

170
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,670
Don't you even think about it!

171
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,910
Back it up.

172
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,440
Disarms the guard and handcuffs him to the base.

173
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,020
So,where's the threat?

174
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,540
The guard's disarmed and chained.

175
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,630
How's he a threat to the unsub?

176
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,090
He isn'T.

177
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,990
Then why did he take the time to assault?

178
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,120
He's got control,

179
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,640
he's obviously got skills,

180
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,050
the very thing that he doesn't have is time.

181
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,260
He didn't assault the guards in the previous banks,why?

182
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,960
What's changed? What's different about this guard?

183
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,410
Maybe this guard reminded him of somebody.

184
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,400
What were the other guards in the previous robberies wearing?

185
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,400
Uniforms?

186
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,100
Black suits.

187
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,750
That's it.

188
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,620
That's all.

189
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,570
Our boy's efficient,

190
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,910
he's determined.

191
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,630
This ain't his first baby.

192
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,500
He's got his trade down cold.

193
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,470
Something about a guy in uniform triggers an emotional response.

194
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,530
Army?

195
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,270
Army,you're conditioned to work with people.

196
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,140
This guy,he don't trust anybody.

197
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,360
Prison.

198
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,400
Best trade school in the country.

199
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,610
I got access to 4 bank robberies with security footage.

200
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,520
What do I get to do with them?

201
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,050
You know your digital perspective whatever software?

202
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,440
Digital perspective analysis rendering?

203
00:09:59,490 --> 00:09:59,890
Yeah.

204
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,800
Honey,not only do I know it,I helped develop it.

205
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,990
Good,'cause I want every physical dimension of the unsub:

206
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,650
Height,waist size,inseam,everything that you can give me.

207
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,240
Honey,if he opens his mouth,

208
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,610
I'll give you the length of his teeth.

209
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,170
Just keep it clean and don't call me honey.

210
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,950
See anything interesting?

211
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,650
Maybe.

212
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
He took his time,

213
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,590
he looked at me,

214
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,140
then he pointed his gun at me.

215
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,910
And you were all naked at this point?

216
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,560
Yes.

217
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,080
Bank manager's wife.

218
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,420
She stopped by to pick him up.

219
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,810
They were going to celebrate their son's 16th birthday.

220
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,270
The son was with them?

221
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,080
Daughter,too.

222
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,560
He knows the kids are theirs?

223
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,880
Well,witnesses said he checked their wallets first.

224
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,190
He would have seen their names.

225
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,950
So,of all 13 people,

226
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,980
he puts together woman in her 60's,guy in his 30's,

227
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,390
married couple in front of their kids.

228
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,590
Why?

229
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,940
Maybe they were the most inappropriate couples he could think of.

230
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,650
He's sadistic.

231
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,720
Would explains why he brings them herE.

232
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,960
He could have taken them behind the teller windows,

233
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,460
he could have taken them back into the vault,

234
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,350
but he chooses here.

235
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,380
It's the most exposed place in the bank.

236
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,310
Like a stage.

237
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,320
Like,it was as important for them to see what was going on as it was for him.

238
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,490
Public humiliation. 

239
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,390
I said,watch it!

240
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,670
Robbery wasn't about the money;

241
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,200
it was about getting off on what he made these people do on this spot.

242
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,510
Forcing others to squirm and watch.

243
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,820
We got to know what exactly they were forced to do.

244
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,380
We need to see the fantasy.

245
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,750
Did you ever get a hold of the security videos?

246
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,130
Yes,but they were mostly erased.

247
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,290
That's henderson,the bank manager.

248
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,900
Said he was so flustered after what he had been through,

249
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,740
that when he was gathering the tapes for us,

250
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,970
he hit the wrong buttons and erased part of them.

251
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,780
You believe him?

252
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,570
No. I told him I thought he was embarrassed 

253
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,610
about the tapes getting out and he erased them on purpose.

254
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,710
He denied it.

255
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,520
You rule out the possibility he was in on it?

256
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,980
Why would he be involved in a robbery when he had to go through something like that?

257
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,700
Well,maybe he didn't know what was going to happen.

258
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,690
Maybe he was betrayed by the unsub.

259
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,310
Or perhaps he was coerced.

260
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,260
There's been many documented cases of robbers 

261
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,530
forcing bank managers to assist them with their crimes.

262
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,980
Yeah,none of that is consistent with the M.O.'S of the other robberies.

263
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,990
Maybe there's a reason this last one was different from the others.

264
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,480
Call from quanico on one.

265
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,530
Thanks.

266
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,640
Garcia,it's hotch.

267
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,730
Are we ready for something completely weird?

268
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,550
How weird are we talking,garcia?

269
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,000
The security footage hotch gave me,

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,120
I ran it through my software 3 times...

271
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,040
and?

272
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,490
And there are weird height issues.

273
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,070
I.E.,The unsub in the first 3 robberies is 6 foot 1 

274
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,990
and the unsub in the last robbery,he's 5'10".

275
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,780
So what?The last robbery we're dealing with a different unsub?

276
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,100
An unsub who is somehow able to erase tapes 

277
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,360
that show exactly what happened at that bank.

278
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,170
An unsub who may have possibly had inside help.

279
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,470
I think it's time we sat down with the bank manager.

280
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,850
Look,I already told the other agent that I was nervous.

281
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,490
I screwed up.

282
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,180
I--what else do you want me to say?

283
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,680
It took you 9 minutes to call 911 after the robber left.

284
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,240
I was collecting the tapes.

285
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,820
Before you called 911?

286
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,120
You think I had something to do with this?

287
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,090
You think I'd put my family through this?

288
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,830
No.

289
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,330
I don't think you'd put your family through letting those tapes get out either.

290
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,700
You were the only one who had access to those tapes,mr. Henderson.

291
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,710
Now,at best,you erased them because you were embarrassed,and at rst,

292
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,280
because you had something to do with the robbery.

293
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,830
Now,which one would you rather have us think?

294
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,770
You got to understand.

295
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,730
We were raised baptists.

296
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,570
It's hard for us to talk about this kind of thing.

297
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,280
It's hard for all of us.

298
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,500
The thought about anybody seeing those tapes,

299
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,790
even the police...

300
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,220
no.

301
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,840
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,750
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,540
I didn't think it would matter.

304
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,610
I think it's pretty clear what this is about.

305
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,680
Shame and humiliation.

306
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,070
Everybody,down!

307
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,290
I said,watch it!

308
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,650
Watch it!

309
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
there is nothing wrong with my software.

310
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,930
My software is perfect,

311
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,690
isn't it?

312
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,210
No,it isn'T.It is.

313
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,490
Why must your beauty be so painful?

314
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,070
Yeah?

315
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,790
Uh,pals,

316
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,500
don't be ticked,

317
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,620
but I think I may have missed the sort of  glaringly obvious here.

318
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,360
How would you make yourself taller without being a different person entirely or

319
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,400
having some sort of weird chinese surgery?

320
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Heels.

321
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,600
Right,sunshine,but would have seen heels,

322
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,850
unless the unsub had them hidden inside his shoe.

323
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,210
The point is,lifts.

324
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,930
Lifts.

325
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,550
Lifts,all hidden up inside his boot.

326
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,560
With a little fancy footwork,

327
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,690
pun emphatically intended,

328
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,370
garcia here managed to dig him out.

329
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,290
Thanks,girl.

330
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,560
He's trying to throw us off,

331
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,500
hide his real height.

332
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,960
But why would he take the lifts out just for the last robbery?

333
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,250
Maybe he's getting careless.

334
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,030
Which means he's also getting more dangerous.

335
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,050
At least we know we're only dealing with one unsub.

336
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,940
Aah!

337
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,710
Based on the knowledge that spending a significant time

338
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,440
in prison stunts emotional growth while increasing professional skills,

339
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
we can estimate this unsub went to jail

340
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,550
between the ages of 18 and 22 and spent 

341
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,370
between5 and 10 years inside.

342
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,340
That puts him at the approximate age between 23 and 35.

343
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,490
This guy's much more than just a bank robber though.

344
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,630
What started out as a practical M.O.,

345
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,840
Stripping his hostages,

346
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,750
triggered a deep psycho-sexual response.

347
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,820
In other words,

348
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,490
when he found himself in front of a bunch of naked people under his control,

349
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,560
he snapped,then he decided to manipulate them.

350
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,110
Better,or just getting worse?

351
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,020
He's attacking banks earlier in the day 

352
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,790
when more and more people are present.

353
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,040
This sounds like he's sacrificing the safety of having just a few hostages to contain,

354
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,310
for the satisfaction of having more subjects to control.

355
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,110
He'll be less interested in money 

356
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,960
and more interested in sadistically  anipulating his captives.

357
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,340
In all likelihood,he's high on drugs.

358
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,260
It'd be wrong,however,to write this guy off as crazy.

359
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,310
Bank robbing is an ambitious crime and 

360
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,210
it takes time and planning to pull it off.

361
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,440
What makes this unsub unique is his fractured psyche.

362
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,730
On the one hand,

363
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,350
a cold,organized bank robber.

364
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,670
On the other,

365
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,780
a disorganized sexual sadist full of bottled up rage.

366
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,630
Freeze!

367
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,900
Drop it!

368
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,620
No.

369
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,020
Come on now,just put it down.

370
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,470
I got a mac-10.

371
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,410
One shot. 

372
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,760
You got one shot to kill me.

373
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,520
Even if you kill me,I'm going down shooting.

374
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,860
The 2 parts of his psyche have just begun to bleed though,

375
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,860
and when they finally converge,

376
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,170
we're talking about a criminal 

377
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,330
with the skills and efficiency of a master bank robber

378
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,360
and the rage of a suicide bomber.

379
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,340
He will explode.

380
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,620
Take them off.

381
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,390
-I said take them off. -No.

382
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,950
Take...them...off!

383
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,770
Sir,bank robbery in progress.

384
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,430
Corner of washington and sepulveda.

385
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,990
Kid in the back called 911 on his cell.

386
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,900
Said the suspect's started making people undress.

387
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,770
How far are we from the bank?

388
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,580
Without traffic,10 minutes.

389
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,010
Let's avoid traffic.

390
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,080
Do I have everybody's attention?

391
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,280
How we doing?

392
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,870
5 minutes.

393
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,880
Make it 3.

394
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,640
Please?

395
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,620
Less than a mile.

396
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,410
Just around the corner.

397
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,390
Is this your bike?

398
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,160
Call E.M.S.!

399
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,680
F.B.I.He took off.Where?

400
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,410
I don't know.

401
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,190
Ma'am. Ma'am,can you hear me?

402
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,100
She's unconscious.

403
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,010
Medics are on their way.

404
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,590
Gideon,he may be headed your way.

405
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,350
You know what the odds are of catching a motorcycle with a car in L.A.?

406
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,510
Right now,I'm trying not to think about it.

407
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,450
There.

408
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,720
Damn it.Go.

409
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,110
It's the first time he's made so many mistakes.

410
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,030
Hit the bank in the morning,

411
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,060
more people around.

412
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,710
Didn't clear the back room,

413
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,910
parked his bike right out front.

414
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,090
Didn't bother taking any money.

415
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,830
Did almost everything you predicted.

416
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,430
Sometimes it sucks to be right.

417
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,800
Witnesses said he refused to take off his clothes.

418
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:57,940
Damn.

419
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,920
That's enough.

420
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,680
It's not the kind of rage you bottle back up.

421
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,100
This could be the beginning of a spree.

422
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,830
How's jj doing on that suspect list?

423
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,900
I'll call her.

424
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,630
I'll call reid and elle and get them on it,too.

425
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,990
You don't think he's going to rob another bank?

426
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,680
No.

427
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,220
He doesn't care about money anymore.

428
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,960
Whatever he's after,

429
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,320
he'll hurt anyone who gets in his way.

430
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,620
Hey.

431
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,770
You call elle and reid?

432
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,540
Yeah.

433
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:56,920
What's that?

434
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,430
My son's first steps.

435
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,010
I was out of town and haley sent me the file.

436
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,080
It's nice.

437
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,970
It's 5 months ago.

438
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,860
I haven't loaded anything on here since.

439
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,900
Ok.So you film a new one when you get home.

440
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,730
So,you're sure this is it?

441
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,620
Yeah. Based on all the parameters,

442
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,020
age,armed robbery charge,

443
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,730
time spent in prison,

444
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,400
approximate location of home address based on geographical profile.

445
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,450
It's about 360 names 

446
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,310
these guys aren't sweethearts,

447
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,440
but there's only a handful with sex crimes on their rap sheets 

448
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,180
and none are sexual sadists.

449
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,480
That's not surprising.

450
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,540
Bank robbers and gun nuts aren't typically sex offenders.

451
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,230
That's what makes this one so unique.

452
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,150
What about a pimp?

453
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,850
Roland lynch,32 years old.

454
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,410
Pimps are characteristically sociopath and,

455
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,820
in many cases,sadistic.

456
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,140
Helps control their employees.

457
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,080
Well,this one started out robbing convenience stores 

458
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,560
before working his way into pimping.

459
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,090
That's unusual.

460
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,800
Pimps typically violate by proxy,

461
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,520
forcing others to do the work for them,whereas,

462
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,310
bank robbers usually operate in pairs or alone.

463
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,030
So,he's sexually sadistic and has experience with armed robbery.

464
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,940
Along with fitting all other parameters of the profile.

465
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,600
All right.I'll get in touch with his parole officer.

466
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,890
You're lynch's parole officer.

467
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,190
When was the last time you talked to him?

468
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,490
Haven't talked to lynch in a month.

469
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,340
What can you tell us about him?

470
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,120
Roland?

471
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,760
A real peach.

472
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,100
He used to punish his girls by raping them in front of their little sisters.

473
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,760
He got a habit?

474
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,930
Which one of mine doesn't?

475
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,110
If I'm not mistaken,

476
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,810
he probably has about a 10 rock a day monkey.

477
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,210
If lynch is our guy,

478
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,220
he's going downhill fast,

479
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,880
but if he's tweaked,he's going down even faster.

480
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,360
His latest drug test isn't back yet,

481
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,410
but I'm betting it isn't going to be clean.

482
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,840
You got a line on him?

483
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,940
Give me a break.You know what my case load is like?

484
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,250
Hey,come on,maN.

485
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,630
He might have beaten a civilian to death with a mac-10,

486
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,590
caved in a meter maid's face,and that's just the beginning.

487
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,480
That make the top of your list?

488
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,740
I'll make some calls.

489
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,970
F.B.I. I need roland lynch.

490
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,220
I need to talk to roland lynch.

491
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,920
Roland lynch?

492
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,510
Hey! Roland lynch?

493
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,060
Don't even think about it.

494
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,970
Don't move!

495
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,720
Give it to me.

496
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,820
Give it to me.

497
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,880
Roland,I can count about 16 different ways you've just violated your parole.

498
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,890
They send in feds for busting parole?

499
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,640
We're here for the bank robberies and the delivery man you killed.

500
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,070
I don't rob banks.

501
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,140
You violated parole,

502
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,480
we've got you on possession,

503
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,320
you're going down.

504
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,000
You think I'm gonna roll over 'cause you're waving 3 to 5 at me?

505
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,230
I took beating's that lasted longer than that.

506
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,470
If i were you,I wouldn't even worry about the murder charge.

507
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,850
I'd worry what happens to you when word gets around you're a pervert.

508
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,850
Yeah,well,I made my living being a pervert.

509
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,780
You can tell them that.

510
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,920
Oh,this is different.

511
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,910
Went after little old ladies,kids.

512
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,260
Witnesses say you got off when the old lady took her shirt off.

513
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,290
Old ladies,kids,inside,think about it.

514
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,100
Hey,roland,

515
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,370
you're high out of your mind right now,aren't ya?

516
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,140
Get him in the car.

517
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,060
Take him back to the field office,

518
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,000
spend a few hours with him,he'll sober up.

519
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,130
Give me a pot of coffee and I'll go all night with this fool.

520
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:09,930
Get him out of here.

521
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,690
Hey,morgan.

522
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,250
We got him.

523
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,930
This guy's a hardcore prison rat.

524
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,100
Hey.

525
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,710
Hang on.

526
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,020
We just got another call,restaurant in the south bay.

527
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,610
Guy came in in a ski-mask,started making people undress.

528
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,160
He just shot a 14-year-old kid.

529
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,830
When?

530
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,830
10 minutes ago.

531
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,780
What'd she say?

532
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,750
Hardcore or not,you've got the wrong scumbag.

533
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,670
According to witnesses,

534
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,710
he came in and fired at the ceiling.

535
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,690
Then he separated all the kids from their parents.

536
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:11,880
Then?

537
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,040
He's forcing the sons to hit their mothers.

538
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,170
He started to.

539
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,320
When he tried to get the first one to hit his mother harder,

540
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
he refused,

541
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,870
and when he refused...

542
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,550
it doesn't make sense.They're children.

543
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,080
He's playing out a fantasy.

544
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,300
Yeah,but it's his fantasy and someone else's children.

545
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,610
They're surrogates of some kind.

546
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,690
No. You don't do this to someone else's kids to get off.

547
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,570
You just don't do it.

548
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,340
It just doesn't make sense to me.

549
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,420
You internalize violence.

550
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,860
You take it out on other people.

551
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,970
Why force somebody else to do it?

552
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,800
Why force children to act out your rage?

553
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,110
He didn't make the children do anything at the bank.

554
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,540
Manager said he put the parents together.

555
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,840
So,why is he so focused on the kids now?

556
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,400
I want to talk to the bank manager again.

557
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,020
I don't know what else I can tell you.

558
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,550
I've already gone over it 3 times.

559
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,730
What we need to know is 

560
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,480
if there's something in that tape that you don't want us to know about?

561
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,900
There were 12 other people in that bank who were forced to watch.

562
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,670
What could I possibly be hiding?

563
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,990
This is about your children,isn't it?

564
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,760
We're sorry.

565
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,610
Mr. Henderson,this is very important.

566
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,710
He's already killed 2 people and he's not going to stop.

567
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,170
God! Go ahead.

568
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Why don't you tell them what he did to us,

569
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,530
what you let him do?

570
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,370
He had a gun.

571
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,900
He was going to kill me.

572
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,060
Come on.

573
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,880
They took my family from me.

574
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,630
We can't even look at each other anymore.

575
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,650
I don't know how a family gets over something like that.

576
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,400
They don'T.

577
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,100
Excuse me.

578
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,800
Is it true he would have killed my father if he tried to stand up to him?

579
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,560
There's no way to know,darren,

580
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,170
but your father did the right thing.

581
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,900
Is there some reason you doubt that?

582
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,260
It's just...

583
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,150
the robber said something afterwards.

584
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,160
He said he was sorry.

585
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,440
He apologized.

586
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
Sadists don't apologize.

587
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,210
They gloat,maybe,

588
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,540
but they don't apologize.

589
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,910
Our guy's not a sadist.

590
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,960
We got that part of the profile wrong.

591
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,930
He doesn't derive any sadistic pleasure from these fantasies,

592
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,720
they're--they're more like a compulsion.

593
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,730
Compulsion that's literally life or death?

594
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,590
I mean,if anyone interferes,he kills them.

595
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,800
It's like he's compelled to direct these fantasies using these people as actors.

596
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,380
Actors on a stage,it's a play.

597
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,050
It's a psychodrama.

598
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,540
What's that?

599
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,870
It's a form of psychotherapy whereby actors serve as surrogates for actual people in the patient's life.

600
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,970
Incorporates many elements of theatre,including an audience.

601
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,920
There's a very famous pilot program 

602
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,270
at the san luis obispo county jail in the mid-nineties.

603
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,240
Isn't that just a couple hours away from here?

604
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,520
Let's go over the suspect list and 

605
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,750
see how many of them did time in san luis obispo.

606
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,940
The answer is 4.

607
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,220
Come on. Tell me you narrowed it down a little more than that.

608
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,870
Only 2 live in state,

609
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,120
but only 1 lives in L.A.

610
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,160
Ha,that a girL.

611
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,280
Caleb dale sheppard,last known address 236 harbor lane,inglewood.

612
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,140
Thanks,mama.

613
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,810
That's only 1.6 miles from the last restaurant he hit.

614
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,320
I've been studying a lot of L.A. Maps.

615
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,900
If he's been attacking that close to home,

616
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,200
he's given up any interest in protecting his identity.

617
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,840
You all go down there and split up,half to his address,

618
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,290
half patrol around the restaurant in case he's on the hunt.

619
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,030
Mrs. Sheppard,do you know where your son is?

620
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,530
Dale doesn't live here anymore.

621
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,900
Where is he,mrs. Sheppard?

622
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,820
He's a grown man.

623
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,960
You have any idea how much trouble your son could be in?

624
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,240
Jail?

625
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,980
He's a good boy.

626
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,080
Lost his way a bit,that's all.

627
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,440
Well,that's one way to look at 12 years in and out of prison.

628
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,550
You've never made a mistake?

629
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,640
Your son spent time in a juvenile home?

630
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,860
He was out of control,

631
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,430
even attacked his own sister once,

632
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
but his father died.

633
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,320
It wasn't his fault.

634
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,360
Was it yours?

635
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,520
What?

636
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,870
Was it your fault?

637
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,890
How many of these did you take today,mrs. Sheppard?

638
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,220
I had back problems my whole life.

639
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,130
She's completely out of her mind.

640
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,960
She's so lonely she'll just keep talking to us.

641
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,420
I doubt she'll tell us where he is.

642
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,540
That was garcia.

643
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,350
Apparently sheppard's sister died 12 years ago,suicide.

644
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,850
Lady sure did a number on her kids.

645
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,770
She's probably lonely after the husband died and on painkillers,

646
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,140
not in her right mind,

647
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,460
nobody there to turn to but sheppard and his sister.

648
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,290
So,now he's symbolically punishing his mother?

649
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,760
He's playing out a fantasy.

650
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,840
Sons gaining total control over their mothers.

651
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,510
We got something.

652
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,560
"Dale daybreak hotel."

653
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,950
Sheppard,F.B.I.

654
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,830
Key?

655
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,760
No,I got one.

656
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,660
Clear!

657
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,540
Yeah,it's clear here,too.

658
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,700
Morgan.

659
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,650
Crystal meth.

660
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,270
Oh,he's got to be halfway out of his mind by now.

661
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,290
Which would explain why he left this behind.

662
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,980
Well,it looks like he's on foot.Here's his bike.

663
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,210
I'm calling hotch.

664
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,210
Yeah?

665
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,050
Look,he's not here.

666
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,840
From the looks of it,he just left.

667
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,900
Hotch,he's tweakin'.

668
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,070
He's unmasked and he's probably on foot.

669
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,150
All right,stay there.Call if there's any sign of him.

670
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,320
Ok. You. Too.

671
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,770
If he's on foot,he must still be in the neighborhood.

672
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,810
How do we find him?

673
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,250
At this point,he'll probably hit the first thing that catches his attention.

674
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,270
Families.

675
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,670
Public places.

676
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,150
If the trend continues,he'll look for a bigger audience.

677
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,580
Public place with families.

678
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,460
Guys,there's a public park not far from here.

679
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,010
Where?

680
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,350
.6 miles from where we are now.

681
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,400
.9 miles from the hotel where the unsub's staying,

682
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,680
which we'll actually pass if we take a right at the next light.

683
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,060
It doesn't matter what they say

684
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,290
in the jealous games people play,hey ey ey

685
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,130
There's no sign of him.

686
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,760
We've got cruisers everywhere.Where could he be?

687
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,450
There's only a few blocks betweenhere and his hotel.

688
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,670
He's got to be really close.

689
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,430
-Do it. -No.

690
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,520
I said,do it.

691
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,570
No.

692
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,960
Do it.It's ok.

693
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,690
Come on,you can do it.

694
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,500
No,no.

695
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,380
Please,just do what he says,please.

696
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,760
I said do it!

697
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,980
Please,do what he says.

698
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,680
It's ok,sweethearT.

699
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,240
Mommy says it's ok.

700
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,490
Put it down.

701
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,330
Drop the knife.

702
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,660
It won't fix you,sheppard.

703
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,360
It doesn't matter what you make them do,

704
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,170
how many people are watching you.

705
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,370
Oh,my god.

706
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,090
Got him.

707
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,680
It's ok.

708
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,410
Look at these people.

709
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,620
Look at them!

710
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,160
They're children.

711
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,250
They're children,

712
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,290
for god's sake.

713
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,860
I need something that kills.

714
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,990
Give me something.

715
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,650
I need something. Aah!

716
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,390
You shot me!

717
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,670
You had a hunting knife to a little boy's throat.

718
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,690
Just give me something for the pain,

719
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,410
you son of a bitch!

720
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:19,940
She did it!

721
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,010
Who did?

722
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,260
My mama.

723
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,040
You don't know what she did to me.

724
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,050
Did you really think you were going to get back at your mom 

725
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,630
by attacking all these other people?

726
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,310
The bitch deserved it.

727
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,780
Except you didn't go after her,

728
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,130
you went after all these other women.

729
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,730
So what?

730
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,810
You went after children.

731
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,690
They're going to have to learn sooner or later.

732
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,680
What are they going to have to learn?

733
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,410
That no one's there for you.

734
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,670
He's a drug addict.He's detoxing.

735
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,030
I don't care what he asks for.

736
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,060
Don't give him anything.

737
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,660
Come on.

738
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,370
He's not a doctor.

739
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,350
He's right.I'm an F.B.I. Agent,and he killed a 14-year-old boy today.

740
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,430
"The basis of shame is not some personal mistake of ours,

741
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,830
but that this humiliation is seen by everyone."

742
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,940
Milan kundera.

743
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,110
You ok?

744
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,900
I was showing those trainees around the offices the other day.

745
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,640
They all want to be in the bau.

746
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,740
I told them what a great job it is.

747
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,460
And they even applauded when the tour was over.

748
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,660
I heard.

749
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,580
Yeah,but I really didn't tell them the truth.

750
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,120
I didn't tell them what it's like to spend your days in this hell.

751
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,240
It's fun,huh?

752
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,470
I mean,who's to blame for somebody like sheppard?

753
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,040
His mother?

754
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,250
Broken home?

755
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,100
Society?

756
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,670
All of it?

757
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,300
None of it?

758
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,050
It gets worse and worse with each case.

759
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,170
Save one life,we save the world.

760
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,460
Yeah.

761
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,010
Well,the one thing I didn't tell the trainees.

762
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,130
What's that?

763
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,820
We do not get paid enough.

764
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,300
You got that right.
