1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,780
- Nothing's happening 
- Watch

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,710
Ah

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,570
Ooh Ah,what--

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,380
I'm so sorry,emily

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,170
What was that

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,380
Don't you recognize a rocket when you see one

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,120
I--I was merely demonstrating a physics law

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,250
I--I--I didn't meant to hit-- oh,show me

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,120
All right

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,260
Uh... well,turn around,please

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,170
Turn around

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,370
Yeah,he's not gonna show you... how it's done

13
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,890
A magician doesn't reveal his secrets

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,440
But I thought you said it was physics

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,860
Physics...magic

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,640
Trust me

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,350
It will not do you any good to argue with him

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,170
All right,all right,turn back and observe

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,710
All: Oh

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,460
Physics magic

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,490
Yes,sir

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,110
Reid,we talked about this

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,470
I'm sorry,sir

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,700
Really starting to get some distance on those

25
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,610
So he does have a sense of humor

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,830
Sometimes

27
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,610
Hey,where's morgan

28
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,130
In chicago

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,970
He goes there every year for his mother's birthday

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,360
[Camera clicks] You're sure she's got enough butter

31
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,180
You know if sarah doesn't put it on the list she doesn't need it

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,300
- She doesn't make mistakes

33
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,500
Looking good

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,710
I mean,damn

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,210
You fillin' out all good in all the right places,aren't you

36
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,180
Step off,rodney

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,080
Desiree,get in the car

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,400
- Come on,derek,it's nothing

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,650
Heh heh

40
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,980
That's ok,baby

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,380
I'll get wit' you a little later,huh

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,610
Yeah,in your dreams

43
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,080
Ooh,most definitely

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,520
All night long,baby girl,huh

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,640
You better step off before I make you wish you never walked up on me

46
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,230
What,you think you a bad-ass now because they pay you to wear that gun,mr Fbi

47
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,870
Rodney,I proved a long time ago I don't need a gun to take you out

48
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,260
Past history,that's a dangerous thing for you to count on,my friend

49
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,850
Walk away

50
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,310
Ha ha ha

51
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,500
Des,I'll get at you a little later,huh

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,630
Go to hell

53
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,480
Bitch

54
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,160
You all right

55
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,730
Just a fool

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,180
come on,I'm taking you home

57
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,580
There's something I gotta do

58
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,980
That's the man,james

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
Way to run a route

60
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,950
Nice job,nice job

61
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,520
Come on,damien

62
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,080
You call that pass coverage

63
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,860
You bite on the inside route every damned time

64
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,250
Ok,let's bring it in,boys

65
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,440
Get your helmets,let's go

66
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,690
[Sighs] You pushed off on that last catch

67
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,280
Man,you weren't close enough to push off of

68
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,200
I blew you away

69
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,950
I could cover your ass all day long

70
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,960
- Man,kiss it all day long

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,620
Hey,hey,hey

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,050
Knock it off

73
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,500
Knock it off

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,810
That's enough

75
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,050
You did push off,james,on your second cut,with your inside hand

76
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,950
Damn right

77
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,240
Hey

78
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,820
It's not the push-off that beat you,though

79
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,340
That's happening off the line

80
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,780
Who are you

81
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,810
What's up,derek

82
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,800
What's up,youngster

83
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,430
I see you're still shakin' and bakin'

84
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,000
I get what I can

85
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,990
Damien,this is derek morgan

86
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,170
The derek morgan

87
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,380
Fbi derek morgan

88
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,670
Just derek,brother

89
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,490
Nice to meet you,man

90
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,580
- Yeah

91
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,510

92
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,450
Get over there Come on

93
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,510
Take him wit' you Get over there

94
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,000
Get the hell outta here

95
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,740
You wanna mess with somebody

96
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,990
Morgan: Uh-oh

97
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,020
1,2,3... happy birthday to ya

98
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,310
Happy birthday to ya

99
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,850
Happy birthday

100
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,020
Go ahead,momma

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
Did you make this yourself

102
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,690
Uh,sarah helped me

103
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,920
Momma,they wouldn't let me help so I don't know how good it's gonna taste

104
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,850
Oh,no,no,no

105
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,620
- You remember that christmas fiasco of 1994

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,830
Whatever,that was 12 years ago

107
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,350
Let it go

108
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,880
No,no,we still get cards from the fire department

109
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,220
Momma,momma,you see how they treat your baby boy

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,450
You be good to your brother

111
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,230
Uh-huh,what she said

112
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,580
No,no,no,you got the baby part right

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,530
Ok,you know what

114
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,400
Ok now... [Shrieking and laughter] Ok,wish,wish

115
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,280
Make a wish

116
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,680
Morgan: There it is

117
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,160
[Camera clicks] Just like the others

118
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,360
Hey

119
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,520
Stan

120
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,830
I'm gonna lock that son of a bitch up

121
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,720
Shouldn't we call the powers that be

122
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,940
This is big,stan

123
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,270
To hell with that

124
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,870
What is it

125
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,000
Here

126
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,780
It's a remote starter,mom

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,980
You hit that button right there and it starts your car from inside the house

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
Why would I do that

129
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,310
So it's nice and warm when you get in it

130
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,300
- Really

131
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,880
No more cold cars in the winter,mom

132
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,700
I would like one for christmas

133
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,350
Not for that bucket you drive

134
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,740
Shut up

135
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,440
get outta here

136
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,130
[Laughter] We miss you around here,baby

137
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,470
I know

138
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,760
Your sisters wish you were around more

139
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,410
You know the unit I work for is only out of virginia,you know that

140
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,290
Well...you're careful,right

141
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,890
I lost your dad

142
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,220
I can't lose you

143
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,970
You won'T

144
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,340
Good

145
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,680
'Cause you owe me some grand babies

146
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,520
Oh,come on,mom

147
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,710
[Knocking on door] Oh,look at that,saved by the bell

148
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,390
Phew

149
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,570
A bunch of them

150
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,860
Oh,come on,mom,stop

151
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,710
Gordinski

152
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,730
You armed

153
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,580
Excuse me

154
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,420
Are you wearing a gun

155
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,720
No

156
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,850
Not right now

157
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,520
Then turn around

158
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,190
This is some kind of sick joke,right

159
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,740
Don't make us get physical

160
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,280
It'll only make it worse for your family

161
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,830
You're under arrest,derek

162
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,180
how secrets deep

163
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,430
how secrets become dark

164
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,670
that's in the nature of secrets

165
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,930
" Writer,cory doctorow

166
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,030
You know,you better have a real good reason for doing that in front of my family

167
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,440
You gonna tell me the charges now

168
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,330
Oh,I bet if you think real hard you'll be able to figure it out,derek

169
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,500
Uncuff him

170
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,670
Agent morgan

171
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,440
You'll always just be derek to me

172
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,760
And you'll always be a racist son of a bitch to me

173
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,510
Right,derek

174
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,140
That's all it is

175
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,420
Then what,man

176
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,040
[Chuckles] Man,I should have done this a long time ago

177
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,610
What the hell are you talking about

178
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,940
Sit down

179
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,910
[Chuckles] Oh,wow

180
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,620
There isn't gonna be a hole deep enough to bury your career

181
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,410
What's wrong with you,man

182
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,860
You know I'm an fbi agent

183
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,850
Well,then you should be fairly aware of your rights

184
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,190
Do you want a lawyer

185
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,770
I'm not some punk kid you can scare anymore,gordinski

186
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,460
Tough guy... you want a lawyer Yes or no

187
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,010
I want a phone call

188
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,680
Local

189
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,400
I need to call my supervisor at fbi headquarters in quantico

190
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,530
Agent hotchner

191
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,910
He's already getting a call

192
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,470
There has to be a mistake

193
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,820
Yes

194
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,390
Of course

195
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,200
We're on our way

196
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,020
[Sighs] This is ssa hotchner,

197
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,070
I need an emergency recall of agents reid,prentiss,jareau and penelope garcia as well

198
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,690
Yeah--uh,yes,I'll call him myself,thank you

199
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,350
Jason,it's hotch,we've got to get to chicago,morgan's been arrested

200
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,630
Homicide

201
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,710
Righ I can wait as long as you guys can

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,170
Did you get some sleep

203
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,690
You know I didn'T

204
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,750
Slept like a baby,myself

205
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,520
Didn't even wanna get out of bed

206
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,070
Really

207
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,870
So that wasn't your donut-eatin' ass on the other side of that glass all night,then,huh

208
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,550
Here you go

209
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,360
You want the other ones

210
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,430
No,just this one right now

211
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,070
[Laughs] Come on,man

212
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,600
You gotta be kidding me,right

213
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,110
Pretend you went home and slept,put an empty box with my name on it on a table right in front of me

214
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,400
The fbi invented this stuff,you simple bastard

215
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,030
We teach it

216
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,570
What's this

217
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,790
It's yesterday

218
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,350
You're following me

219
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,390
Whose grave is that

220
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,360
Why would you be following me

221
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,840
Whose grave

222
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,500
You know I don't know his name

223
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,810
You paid to bury him,didn't you

224
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,880
The neighborhood did

225
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,420
But you led the collection

226
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,180
So

227
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,440
And you visit him a lot

228
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,380
Every time I come home

229
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,550
Is there something wrong with that

230
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,130
[Chuckles] What,you got a crush on me all of a sudden,gordinski

231
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,190
Ok,that's me at the youth center tossing a ball around with a couple of kids

232
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,110
You did a little more than that

233
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,010
This is about you giving one of them a ride home,one of the boys

234
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,330
Yeah

235
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,830
Yeah,I did

236
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,120
This kid named,um,damien

237
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,610
His place was on the way to my mother'S

238
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,580
So what,man

239
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,220
Damien walters,D O A

240
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,610
Oh,no

241
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,990
Somebody killed him

242
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,300
Not somebody,derek

243
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,770
You think I did this

244
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,090
Special agent hotchner,fbi

245
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,120
I'm looking for detective... gordinski

246
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,020
I got this,chuck

247
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,020
How you guys doing

248
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Wally dennison,cpd

249
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,920
Where's agent morgan

250
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,900
Detective gordinski's in with the suspect now

251
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,400
I need to see him

252
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,740
When my partner's finished talking to him

253
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,420
I have your superintendent's personal cell number,

254
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,190
and in the interest of not running roughshod over another police agency

255
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,170
I've resisted calling him so far

256
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,190
I need to see agent morgan now

257
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,600
I'll get gordinski

258
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,120
He's the,uh,primary

259
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,050
I don't like them calling him a suspect

260
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,430
Me neither

261
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,410
You're the last person anyone saw with my victim

262
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,220
You recognize him

263
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,550
Found in an alley four years ago

264
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,060
Still unidentified

265
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,690
John doe

266
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,540
Just like that kid whose grave you visit every time you come to chicago

267
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,210
Another boy

268
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,910
Just after you left the city

269
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,900
This is crazy

270
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,020
No kidding

271
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,880
Look,man,rodney harris

272
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,190
He's been following me around ever since I got back to town

273
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,350
Rodney harris the gangbanger

274
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,600
Yeah,he was waiting for me outside of a corner store

275
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,760
He did that drive-by yesterday

276
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,950
So you think this looks like something a gangbanger did

277
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,600
Is that how you'd advise me,mr Fbi

278
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,280
[Door opens] Dennison: Stan

279
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,390
[Clears throat] [Whispers indistinctly] All right,tell him I'll be there in a minute

280
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,300
You're gonna have to come up with something better than a gangbanger,derek

281
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,400
Detective gordinski,cpb

282
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,910
You think an fbi agent,a bau profiler committed a homicide

283
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,510
Actually,three homicides at least,over 15 years

284
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,080
You--you think he's a serial killer

285
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,290
This is ridiculous

286
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,500
Has he been charged with anything

287
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,710
I got 72 hours for that

288
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,110
I'd like to see him

289
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,030
Be my guest

290
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,070
This way

291
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,880
Agent gideon,right

292
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,820
Yes

293
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,580
I owe you a big thank you

294
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,150
I had no suspects at all until you looked over my case for me and sent me this profile

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,890
Everything in it points to that son of a bitch,derek morgan

296
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,110
[ ] I profiled him

297
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,050
It's all right there

298
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,450
Detective,a profile's just a guide

299
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,970
Yeah,this one guided me to him

300
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,200
They're really more useful in the elimination of suspects rather than the inclusion

301
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,950
That's not the way you presented it to me

302
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,420
Well,if I confused you,I'm sorry

303
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,940
I'm not confused at all

304
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,380
Look,whatever it is in here that made you consider agent morgan a suspect has to be coincidencE

305
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,980
You can't rely solely on this

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,660
You're right,I'm not

307
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,350
[Door opens] You ok

308
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,720
This kid

309
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,040
I was with him yesterday

310
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,310
So

311
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,560
So he's dead

312
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,550
I drove him home,hotch,and gordinski's saying I was the last person seen with him

313
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,740
15 years ago,I was a new detective

314
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,170
One of my first cases was a black kid

315
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,120
12 or 13 years old,found strangled in a vacant lot near here

316
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,540
Boy was a john doe,right

317
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,320
Still unidentified to this day

318
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,910
Wait,a 12-year-old kid that no one reported missing

319
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,000
Ever

320
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,370
Four years ago,another body turns up,same M O

321
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,510
Worked that case just as hard,came up with just as much nothing

322
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,550
Nobody in the area had ever seen the kid before

323
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,220
No one's looking for these kids

324
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,620
Then a few months back,I attended a seminar that you taught at cpd headquarters

325
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,160
I told you about my case,you said to send you the files and you'd look 'em over

326
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,860
This is the profile you worked up

327
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,140
There are about 3 million people in chicago

328
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,540
Your profile said I was looking for a black male,25 to 35,with a knowledge of the area

329
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,750
Nonthreatening to children-- either knows them or is normal enough that he doesn't scare them

330
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,150
A probable criminal record

331
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,620
It also said the way the body was placed

332
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,120
gently on a mattress,not just tossed on the ground,

333
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,410
indicated someone who was probably consumed with guilt,especially for the first victim

334
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,080
Your exact words are--

335
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,160
"with a guilt-ridden offender,"the bau postulates the first victim is the most important "

336
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,150
and the unsub may still visit the place of the crime or even the victim himself

337
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,860
" Care to guess who visits my first victim every time he's in town

338
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,460
Can't be just visiting the victim

339
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,920
There has to be more than that

340
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,860
Sure

341
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,360
You said the unsub might try to inject himself into the investigation to keep tabs on it

342
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,880
Morgan has called our headquarters many times since he joined the bureau

343
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,260
Always about this case

344
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,990
So,wait,he talked to you about it

345
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,860
Headquarters

346
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,250
He'd never call me

347
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,480
After I got your profile,I checked airline records

348
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,360
Turns out derek had just left chicago when the other body turned up

349
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,980
Tell me the story from the beginning

350
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,020
I--I guess it starts when I was 15

351
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,930
I was coming home from football practice one day

352
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,610
[Car horn blares] Me and my boy,we were goofing off,

353
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,680
you know,we were throwing a football around

354
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,910
[Telephone ringing] The only person that I'd ever seen dead before that was my father

355
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,470
when I was ten

356
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,520
I mean,there I was,I was looking at this kid and he was my own age,hotch

357
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,730
Dead in this vacant lot

358
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,600
And he was never identified

359
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,070
Nobody knew who he was,nobody ever even reported him missing

360
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,470
And that,that just didn't sit right with me

361
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,200
So I--I felt responsible for him,I mean,I was the one that found him,right

362
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,540
I went around the neighborhood,door to door,trying to start a collection,

363
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,710
and... eventually I got enough so I could bury him,and... I gave him a little headstone

364
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,100
What did you put on the headstone if he wasn't identified

365
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,550
Morgan: Just the date

366
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,950
I left room for a name if he was ever identified

367
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,610
And you still visit him

368
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,400
Hotch,I go see this kid every time I'm home

369
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,140
I just feel like he deserves to have somebody look in on him

370
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,140
Gordinski must read that as a guilty conscience,a killer revisiting his victim

371
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,760
But that can't be the only reason he suspects you

372
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,140
Believe me,that guy's had it in for me my entire life

373
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,840
He's supremely confident that you're his killer

374
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:13,380
Then yesterday another kid ends up dead and the last person he was with was derek morgan

375
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,250
In the boy's pocket we found one of his fbi business cards,

376
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,920
his cell number written on the back of it

377
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,990
In fact,every time morgan's in town,he hangs out with kids

378
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,470
This is all just coincidence

379
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,840
A hell of a lot of coincidences

380
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,420
It's purely circumstantial

381
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,850
So's a fingerprint

382
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,930
Did I mention that morgan found the body in 1991

383
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,580
Hidden way back in a vacant lot

384
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,930
Now,don't you teach that when a body is hard to find,

385
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,210
the person finding it is always a suspect

386
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,900
Reid: There are key pieces of the profile that don't fit,detective

387
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,890
Uh,the age,25 to 35,morgan was 15 or so at the time

388
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,180
Also says that age is the hardest to predict,

389
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,170
and I should never exclude someone simply because of a discrepancy with the age

390
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,070
What about the speculation

391
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,520
that since he didn't managed to leave any evidence at the scene of the crime

392
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,190
and he most likely has a criminal record or previous law enforcement knowledge

393
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,070
Derek wasn't even in the bureau yet when the first body was found

394
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,880
He may not have had a knowledge of law enforcement

395
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,580
but derek morgan definitely had a criminal record

396
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,520
A desperate detective here

397
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,580
Three dead boys,no evidence at all,

398
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,310
so he applies the profile directly to someone he already suspected

399
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,760
It's easy to get tunnel vision that way

400
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,700
One begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts

401
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,870
That's,uh,one of sherlock holmes's favorite quotes

402
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,790
We need to figure out who really killed these boys before they decide to charge morgan

403
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,740
What do you want us to do

404
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,790
Last victim was someone morgan was seen with

405
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,820
Conveniently,morgan was already a suspect in the other two

406
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,630
Someone set him up

407
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,660
We should consider morgan a victim

408
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,960
Prentiss,you and reid talk to his family,learn about him--

409
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,620
especially around the time of the first murder

410
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,620
Do we have the address

411
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,900
I can take you

412
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,420
Oh,that's ok

413
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,500
Gideon: No Actually,that's not a bad idea

414
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,820
Right

415
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,620
Okey-doke,lead the way,detective

416
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,680
According to morgan,he's got a bad history with gordinski

417
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,990
He's got a bad history generally

418
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,350
Resisting arrest,vandalism,aggravated battery

419
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,960
This is morgan

420
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,830
As a juvenile Look at the dates

421
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,670
This isn't in his personnel file

422
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,320
He said he told me everything relevant

423
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,680
Then he either lied or he doesn't consider this relevant

424
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,870
Since when is the criminal history of a suspect not relevant

425
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,600
You just called him a suspect

426
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,790
Get garcia into morgan's life

427
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,970
Yes,sir

428
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,290
Hey,hotch,I almost forgot

429
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,450
There's a local banger out here,his name is rodney harris

430
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,650
He's been running these streets for a while now

431
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,440
You have a criminal record

432
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,220
What

433
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,580
Where did you get this

434
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,710
What difference does that make

435
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,200
Hotch... this was supposed to be expunged

436
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,310
My record's clean

437
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,250
I asked you if there was anything you hadn't told me

438
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,360
A judge expunged this,it doesn't exist anymore,man

439
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,690
I was a kid,it's nothing

440
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,340
Aggravated battery

441
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,570
I-- [Sighs] Ok

442
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,170
I was with some guys,we got in a fight with some other guys

443
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,860
Rodney,this cat I'm trying to tell you about,it was him

444
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,940
We got into it a little bit,we knocked each other around,

445
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
he got a couple stitches in his head so they made it aggravated

446
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,230
That's it

447
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,170
So you're saying this rodney committed three murders because you beat him up

448
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,220
No

449
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,610
I'm saying he's been following me around since I got here,

450
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,970
so go talk to him and you might get something

451
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,730
This was expunged

452
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,890
You still should've told me

453
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,550
You know how important accurate information is to victimology

454
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,670
Whoa

455
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,960
Whoa

456
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,620
Victimology

457
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,830
It's very likely the latest victim was an attempt to set you up

458
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,460
Are you profiling me

459
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,390
Morgan,we need to look at-- no

460
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,210
We don't need to do anything

461
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,930
Derek,you're in trouble here

462
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,090
[Laughs] Hotch,I didn't do this

463
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,930
I am not worried about gordinski out there

464
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,210
You still have three dead children

465
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,100
Ok,ok,so you profile them

466
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,150
That's the case

467
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,330
Is there something else you don't want us to find out about

468
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,330
Hotch,I don't need the people I work with going into my entire world

469
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,570
Is,uh,derek all right

470
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,160
He wouldn't let us go down there

471
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,870
He's fine

472
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,860
Our boss is with him

473
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,120
Did he tell you gordinski's been harassing him since he was a kid

474
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,310
Reid: Why's that

475
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,720
You'd have to ask that bastard

476
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,760
Oh,sarah

477
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,160
It's true,mom

478
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,030
Sure it is

479
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,890
What are you even doing in my mother's house

480
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,430
They asked me

481
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,200
Oh,really

482
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,490
I don't understand how they could think he did this

483
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,460
Someone may be trying to make it look like he hurt those kids

484
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,020
And the police believe it

485
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,240
Just following the evidence

486
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,340
But he's an fbi agent

487
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,080
Reid: Actually... law enforcement officials

488
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,220
are just as probable statistically to commit a crime as anyone else

489
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,850
Look at the cross-section of a society,there's a general population

490
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,880
and a small fraction-- he's not actually saying

491
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,730
we believe derek's involved in this

492
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,960
Oh,no,no,yeah,not at all

493
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,770
I'm merely,um-- speaking theoretically

494
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,720
You're dr Reid,right

495
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,050
Mm-hm

496
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,080
Derek talks about you

497
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,960
He does

498
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,930
Anyway,so... someone may be trying to make it look like this was derek

499
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,060
But derek loves kids

500
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,530
Every time he's here,he goes to the youth center

501
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,520
Youth center

502
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,030
The upward youth center

503
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,810
Does that have some sort of significance for him

504
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,360
Oh... are you saying there's something in it for him

505
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,980
Other than giving back to the poor kids of your neighborhood

506
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Sarah... sarah,we're friends of your brother'S

507
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,260
We're here trying to help

508
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,550
When we ask a question,it isn't to denigrate or demean anything he's done

509
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,380
We just have to know everything,so we can figure out where to look next

510
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,670
Is there some special significance to the youth center

511
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,940
The youth center saved his life

512
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,120
Does this make any sense to you

513
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,970
No

514
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,010
He's clearly hiding something else

515
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,190
Well,we know he isn't involved in any murders

516
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,160
No

517
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,410
There are larger implications

518
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,320
We can't have people on this team who have secrets

519
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,820
Oh,come on,hotch,we all have secrets

520
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,110
Would you want us profiling you

521
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,130
I feel terrible looking into his life like this

522
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,090
I know,just remember we're trying to help him

523
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,150
Garcia: Right,ok

524
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,670
Graduated with honors from northwestern law

525
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,490
Did you know he was a star football player

526
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,530
Surprisingly,I don't know much about him at all

527
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,180
Quarterback

528
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,350
That's the guy who throws the ball,right

529
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,490
Yes

530
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,960
Ha That's what he was

531
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,060
Full ride athletic scholarship

532
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,180
Sophomore year he severely injured his left knee and he never played again

533
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,180
Ok,garcia,look further back,ok

534
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,330
Before college

535
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,310
Garcia: Right Where are we

536
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,390
Ok,um... wait

537
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,850
He was mentioned in the chicago register as...

538
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,800
body of a ch-child in a vacant lot in 1991

539
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,630
[Sighs] That's our first victim

540
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,180
Garcia: He never told me about this

541
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,300
He never told any of us

542
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,770
My husband,um,their father,was killed when he tried to stop a robbery

543
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,870
Derek was with him,he was ten

544
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,740
A year or so later,he started getting into trouble

545
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,630
What kind of trouble

546
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,570
He started running around with older kids

547
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,920
They would give him money to run errands for them

548
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,610
Not drugs

549
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,350
No,derek would never disgrace his father's name

550
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,930
But they were gangbangers

551
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,840
So people started looking at derek like he was one of them

552
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,950
One night,he and a friend were attacked by some boys from another gang

553
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,930
Big fight

554
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,950
And one of the other boy's head split open

555
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,100
And that was the first time gordinski arrested him

556
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,680
Now,he wasn't a detective yet,just a street cop,

557
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,580
but from that night on,no matter what happened in the neighborhood,he'd pick derek up for it

558
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,860
Dennison: Probably because he was involved

559
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,110
The hell he was

560
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,800
Stan's never arrested anyone who didn't need arresting

561
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,780
He did with derek

562
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,280
Until carl buford stepped in

563
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,280
Carl buford

564
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,770
He runs a youth center

565
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,900
He took derek under his wing

566
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,350
Mentored him

567
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,970
Became like a surrogate father

568
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,320
He taught him football and that changed derek's life

569
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,290
He got a scholarship to college,with it he got his degree

570
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,900
Where is carl buford now

571
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,780
He still runs the youth center

572
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,950
I'd like to talk to him

573
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,370
Detective,do you think you could take me over there

574
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,650
Just you

575
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,460
Yeah

576
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,780
I thought maybe you could stay here and keep going through this stuff

577
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,860
Good idea

578
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,890
Yeah,keep going through the stuff

579
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,000
Is there a criminal history

580
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,170
Garcia: Criminal

581
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,460
Garcia,is there a criminal history

582
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,990
Jj,there's not gonna be a-- [Computer beeps] There's a sealed file

583
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,580
Unseal it

584
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,820
But it's a sealed file

585
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,960
Garcia,helping him

586
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,110
Ah

587
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,260
Right

588
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,690
Helping him,helping him... that's a juvenile criminal record

589
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,380
It was expunged and sealed by a judge esposito

590
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,190
after presentation of a letter and testimonial from a local youth center director

591
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,870
"Finest young man I've ever known,

592
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,020
"criminal record could jeopardize "potential scholarship offers...

593
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,690
stake my personal and professional reputation..."

594
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,590
garcia: He was definitely a fan of our boy

595
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,180
Do we have a name

596
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,870
Hang on a second

597
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,050
I'm carl buford

598
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,070
I've brought damien walters' mother to see detective gordinski

599
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:29,850
Hi,carl

600
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,580
Stan

601
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,230
Mrs Walters,thanks for coming

602
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,530
This way

603
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,200
Buford

604
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,210
Did you just say buford

605
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,520
would you just give me the hell out here

606
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,480
That wouldn't be a good idea,would it

607
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,220
Says who

608
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,820
Apparently I provided the profile that led them to arrest you

609
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,490
You what

610
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,580
They sent the case to me a few months ago

611
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,330
I did a routine consult but he was looking for it to lead to you

612
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,840
Preconception of guilt

613
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,930
We just can't force 'em to let you go,it's not gonna look too good with the local press

614
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,040
Oh,like I give a damn about the press,gideon

615
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,820
Well,we cannot appear to be covering something up

616
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,150
You trying to say something to me right now

617
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,590
Only if you're hiding something You need to trust us

618
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,420
Trust us enough to tell us about it

619
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,820
Gideon

620
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,750
It's not about trust

621
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,360
It's about having a little privacy

622
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,610
I got the right to keep something to myself

623
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,960
Look at us,man,we practically live together already

624
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,940
Then the best way to clear you is...find the real unsub

625
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,380
Find anything out about morgan

626
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,290
The record wasn't picked up in his background check

627
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:00,070
because everything in it was expunged and the file sealed by a judge

628
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,520
Forgiving judge

629
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,780
It was based on the recommendation

630
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,220
of an upstanding member of the community who took personal responsibility for morgan

631
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,740
That sounds like somebody we should talk to for more background

632
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,580
Should be easy,he's right over there

633
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,230
Hello

634
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,650
Mr Buford

635
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,660
This guy's been honored by everybody but the nobel society

636
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,230
That's carl buford

637
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,880
Who are you

638
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,470
I'm with the fbi

639
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,880
Do you know derek morgan

640
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,300
Yeah,he's a friend of mine

641
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,730
I've been trying to call him

642
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,120
He's a little busy right now

643
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,820
Is there something I can do to help you

644
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,240
I just... a friend of mine

645
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,690
Someone killed him yesterday

646
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,590
Do you know something about who might have done it

647
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,900
No

648
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,830
Derek's always telling me if I need somebody to talk to,about anything,I can call him

649
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,790
Guess I just wanted to... I don't know

650
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,340
I'll tell you what

651
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,580
Why don't you give me your name and I'll let him know that you've been trying to reach him

652
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,850
James barfield

653
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,630
Does he know where to find you

654
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,160
He can find me here

655
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,650
Anytime

656
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,340
All the time

657
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,030
You folks work with derek morgan

658
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,350
Yes,sir,closely

659
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,880
You knew him well as a teenager

660
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,710
One of the finest boys I ever coached

661
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,610
Football

662
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,670
I run a youth center

663
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,910
I gather you were instrumental in helping to get his criminal records expunged

664
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,630
I feel terrible about that now

665
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,500
You do

666
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,950
Well,in view of what's happened

667
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,760
What's happened is a mistake

668
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,360
I'm confused,I thought stan said there was all kinds of evidence

669
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,330
There is

670
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,320
Thanks,carl,you can take miss walters home now

671
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,390
Appreciate you bringing her in

672
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,650
Of course,of course

673
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,750
Derek morgan

674
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,660
It's still hard for me to believe

675
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,790
For them,too

676
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,160
I can understand that

677
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,480
Derek had a way of charming people into looking past his deficiencies

678
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,720
Excuse me,deficiencies

679
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,000
Well,you've seen the records

680
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,970
Derek was at the youth center yesterday,wasn't he

681
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,370
Playing football with damien walters and some other boys

682
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,060
Carl's the one that saw 'em leaving together

683
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,090
Did you talk to him

684
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,160
I was working inside

685
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,010
By the time I was done,they were leaving

686
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,820
When was the last time you did talk to him

687
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,020
I don't know

688
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,280
Years

689
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,010
If you need anything else,stan

690
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,800
Anything at all

691
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,330
Thanks,carl

692
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,850
Appreciate it

693
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,800
You seem friendly with mr Buford

694
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,300
I can't tell you how many times that guy's come through for me

695
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,600
Goin' way back to my beat cop days

696
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,690
Carl buford knows the kids in this neighborhood better than almost anybody

697
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,180
He's knocked more than a few of them back onto the straight and narrow

698
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,370
Has he kept up with the investigation

699
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,370
I'm sorry

700
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,360
Over the years,does he ask how it's going

701
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,900
Yeah,he'S... wait a second,you're not gonna try to turn this off on him to save your guy,are you

702
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,870
Just a question

703
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,110
Carl buford is a local hero

704
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,800
I'm sure he is

705
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,100
Carl buford

706
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:53,980
What

707
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Carl buford,he runs the youth center

708
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,330
What's that got to do with anything

709
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,840
He's responsible for getting your records expunged

710
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,780
I told you to stay the hell out of my business

711
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,930
You said you visit the youth center every time you come here

712
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,430
So what

713
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,210
Buford says he hasn't spoken to you in years

714
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,220
Why don't you visit the man who made your career possible

715
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,290
Damn you,hotch

716
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,940
It is none of your damn business

717
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,480
Buford's the one who told detectives you were with damien

718
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,320
I am warning you,hotch

719
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,460
Back off

720
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,170
I'm not saying it's mr Buford

721
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,710
There's a huge amount of investigation left to be done

722
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,060
For 15 years he hasn't been the slightest bit suspicious

723
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,230
Morgan won't even talk about buford

724
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:41,990
He won't

725
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,810
Buford should be that kid's hero

726
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,780
Something happened

727
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
You talking about carl buford

728
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,880
Yes

729
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,510
We just left his office

730
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,130
Dennison: Hey

731
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,200
What,did we turn him loose

732
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,300
You let him escape

733
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,590
black male,33,six foot one,name is derek morgan

734
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,800
You're standing there trying to convince me

735
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,500
that a local hero is my killer while you let my suspect dance our the back door

736
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,930
I'm gonna charge all of your asses

737
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,180
Yes,as soon as possible

738
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,810
You have to tell your officers that morgan's not a threat

739
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,840
Like hell I will

740
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,840
But this-- lady,as far as I'm concerned,he is a threat,ok

741
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,260
They're beyond reason

742
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,480
We have to find hm first

743
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,340
Any ideas

744
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,740
His mother said that buford practically raised him after his father died,

745
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,510
he mentored him,took him on trips,spent all of his time with him

746
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,810
Basically became a surrogate father

747
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,140
Jason,I think I know what he was afraid we'd find

748
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,940
Detective,we may know where he's heading

749
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,580
Lookin' good there,kid

750
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,850
I was tryin' to call you

751
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,150
I'm here now

752
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,970
Someone killed damien

753
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,340
I know

754
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,530
James,we need to talk about carl buford

755
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,610
What about him

756
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,010
You're a star player,right

757
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,130
Center of attention

758
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,310
Yeah,I guess

759
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,640
You know,I used to be that guy

760
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,230
Yeah,I know

761
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,730
It's a lot of pressure,isn't it

762
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,080
Always wanna make 'em happy

763
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,490
Impress 'em

764
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,670
I can handle it

765
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,030
Oh,I'm sure you can,kid

766
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,820
Does he ever take you to his cabin

767
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,890
What

768
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,710
Fishin' in wisconsin,camping

769
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,110
Do things you wish you had a real father for

770
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,760
Sometimes

771
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,620
Yeah,he's good like that

772
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,510
You know about the cabin

773
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,490
James,i told you,I used to be you

774
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,190
What do you mean

775
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,620
The first time you weren't even sure what was goin' on

776
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,520
He brushed up against you

777
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,860
You thought it might have just been an accident

778
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,650
But then at the cabin,he let you sit and drink with him

779
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,640
You thought it was kinda cool

780
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,370
Made you feel grown

781
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,050
He gave you a glass of wine

782
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,640
Maybe a little shot of something harder

783
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,790
And then he took you swimming

784
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,580
Only he told you to jump in without your swimsuit on

785
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,770
He did things to you,james,didn't he

786
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,880
He did 'em to me,too

787
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,560
You do whatever you think you gotta do to keep him happy

788
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,380
because he's the closest thing to a father you got

789
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,200
But what he's doin' to you is wrong

790
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,460
And you don't have to let it continue,man

791
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,200
- Yeah,I do

792
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,880
My oldest brother's in jail,my sister was paralyzed in a drive-by,she's eight years old

793
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,370
I'm all my mom's got left

794
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,990
I gotta get us outta here

795
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,640
Carl's gonna make sure I get into college

796
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,120
Then I can make something of myself

797
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,740
James,you are something,man

798
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,030
You're something right here,right now,without carl buford

799
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,440
You just gotta believe that

800
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,210
Where's carl right now,huh

801
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,160
Look at you,man

802
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,240
You're out here in the dark running pass routes

803
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
That's you

804
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,660
That ain't got nothin' to do with carl

805
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,810
What you got inside of here,that's what's gonna get you off these streets

806
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,600
You never told

807
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,180
Not until right now

808
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,650
Damien always said I should call you

809
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,540
What

810
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,480
Damien knew

811
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,930
I didn't think you'd believe me

812
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:59,640
James... I got your back

813
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,930
Forever

814
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,080
Carl

815
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,430
You've been let go

816
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,240
Looks that way

817
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,670
I told 'em it was crazy,thinkin' you were involved in any killing

818
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,200
Really

819
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,090
Gordinski said you're the one who told 'em I drove damien home

820
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,950
Was that supposed to be a secret

821
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,590
No

822
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,870
That wasn'T

823
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,200
I don't follow

824
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,650
All these years,I kept my mouth shut

825
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,330
I let you go on being a hero

826
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,410
Carl buford,my mentor

827
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,360
What are you talkin' about

828
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,920
God,I was so afraid of you

829
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:07,490
I was afraid of the police,afraid of losing everything I was gaining

830
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,460
But that's how you work,isn't it

831
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,900
You make sure there's a hell of a lot to lose,don't you

832
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,810
I don't know what you think you remember

833
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,400
No,no,no See,it's not what I remember that's gonna hurt you,carl

834
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,090
Our business is over way too long ago to matter

835
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,840
You're protected by a statute of limitations and that's my fault

836
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,130
Then good night

837
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,540
You set me up

838
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,710
You knew damien walters wanted james to call me about you

839
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,490
So you killed him

840
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,860
You killed him because you knew I'd come after you,didn't you

841
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,440
Now you're just talking crazy

842
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,470
God,I should have told somebody about you when I was a kid

843
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,950
When you were helping me

844
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,370
Well,you know what happens in cases like this

845
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,130
Once that dam breaks,the flood comes

846
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,010
One kid steps up,just one

847
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,130
And then another one,and another

848
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,210
Because they're not scared of you anymore

849
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,050
They know they're not alone

850
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,780
James barfield is your dam

851
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,170
Whatever lies james told you... they're not lies

852
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,730
You did the same thing to me

853
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,160
I did nothing to you,to james

854
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,940
One by one,they're gonna pile up until there's so many accusations

855
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,680
- You can't say that they're all lies

856
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,670
any idea how many kids I've helped get out of this neighborhood

857
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,670
Hm

858
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:25,020
How many lives I've provided

859
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,750
Look at yo 

860
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,480
yeah,well,it wasn't for free,was it

861
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,760
I pulled you out of the gutter

862
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,060
I pulled myself out of the gutter,all the way to the fbi

863
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,030
I did that

864
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:42,020
You sayin' I had nothin' to do with making you who you are

865
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,920
No,carl

866
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,820
Actually I'm saying you have everything to do with making me who I am

867
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,530
Because of you I'm somebody who gets to spend the rest of this life

868
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,610
making sure guys like you go down

869
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:03,090
Look,derek... carl: I never hurt you

870
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,790
You could have said no

871
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,510
You're under arrest,carl

872
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,920
I've helped a lot of kids

873
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,760
Let's go

874
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,620
The neighborhood won't be the same without me

875
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,790
It's gonna be worse without the center

876
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,100
Somebody'll keep this center running

877
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,590
The neighborhood will

878
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,640
I will

879
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,870
Wait Wait

880
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,810
DereK... isn't there something you can do for me

881
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,090
You go to hell
