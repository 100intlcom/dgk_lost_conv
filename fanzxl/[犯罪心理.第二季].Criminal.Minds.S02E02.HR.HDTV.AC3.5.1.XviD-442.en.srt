1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,810
His name's jack.

2
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,570
He's a soldier,and he protects me.

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,950
I didn't mean to get you mad.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,280
Please?

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,860
I'll be a good boy.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,010
Please let me out.

7
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,360
Peter.

8
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,920
Katie.

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,230
I think peter's back.

10
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,080
Peter?
Are you sure?

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,930
I just got a new image.

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,240
The screen name onthe sender is hugz.

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,590
He just uploadedthis to me.

14
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,840
We're sure it'sa new image?

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,750
New image,same boy.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,290
Time and datestamped an hour ago.

17
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,510
- Are communicatingdirectly with this hugz?
- No.

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,250
I'm in a chat room.
I was just fishing.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,350
Put him up.

20
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,690
Carl,I need to know wherethis chat room originated.

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,840
People,listen up.

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,060
We have a boy we namedpeter a year ago.

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,130
At the time,he was listedbetween 5 and 6 years old.

24
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,690
I.M. Hugz "vn-ho."

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,370
Very nice.How old.

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,930
Very.

27
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,650
Go to the site.

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,600
That clock iscounting down.

29
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,890
It's an auction clock.

30
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,590
He's gonna sell peter.

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,230
Give me aaron hotchnerat the B.A.U.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,260
40,000 imagesof child pornare posted every weekon the internet,

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,880
along with the appearanceof 20 new children.

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,080
The appetite for babies as youngas 4 months old has soared.

35
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,670
Many of these childrenhave been kidnappedand sold into pedophile rings.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,420
One year ago,the same boy appearedon several web sitesused by pedophiles.

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,430
He was a new face then.

38
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,630
After a massive huntled by our crimesagainst children unit,the boy disappeared.

39
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,190
Until tonight whenS.S.A.Cole telephoned us.

40
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,250
Katie cole?

41
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,680
She was inthe B.A.U.,Right?

42
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,890
One of the firstprofilers,clinical psychologist,brilliant.

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,830
She runs the crimesagainst childrenunit in maryland.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,280
I always wantedto meet her.

45
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,810
Really?
I heardshe's a bitch.

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,800
Nobody ever calledyou that,katie.

47
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,150
Well,not to my face.

48
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,410
The first timeI ever saw him,he appeared in aseries of photos.

49
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,810
I named him peteR.

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,920
Now he's beingauctioned offwhen that clockruns to zero.

51
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,290
Auctioned.

52
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,000
His face isn't pixilated.

53
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,010
'Cause the unsubis confidentthat we're notgoing to be ableto identify himin time.

54
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,920
What aboutthe site itself?

55
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,330
Can't we justtrack its origin?

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,010
It's routed through aproxy server in belarus.

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,150
Even if that governmentwas friendly,peter'd be gonebefore we finishedthe paperwork.

58
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,080
We don't need to worryabout the paperwork.

59
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,600
We have garcia.

60
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,460
- Better get on that,will you?
- Yes,sir.

61
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,330
So,what happeneda year ago,katie?

62
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,880
We cross-referencedthe images of the boy.

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,040
We talked to knownoffenders nationwide.

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,070
We narrowed the locationdown to the easternunited states.

65
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,760
We had some suspects in,but the trail went cold.

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
Until today.

67
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,950
With all due respect,miss cole,how is this time goingto be any different?

68
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,810
We havea starting point.

69
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,020
The location where the imagewas first discovered.

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,210
A chat room--hosted by an independentweb companyin cleveland,ohio.

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,080
And this time,I am bringing youall in with me.

72
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:51,200
Theologiandietrich bonhoeffer said,"the test of the moralityof a societyis what it doesfor its children."

73
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,920
Well,if it isn'tdr.Reid.

74
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,530
Elle.
Wow.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,760
- Nice haircut.
- Thanks.Yeah...

76
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,370
I likeyour haircut,too.

77
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,400
Is that a boys' regular?

78
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,200
Yeah,it is.

79
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,260
Wa--do you not like it?

80
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,630
It's totally you.

81
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,420
So,you're,uh...
ok?

82
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,990
I didn't think youwere back till next week.

83
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,460
Oh,um,I gota text message,so...

84
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,210
then it was a mistake.

85
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,140
Is there a case?

86
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,570
Not untilyou're healthy.

87
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,350
Yesterday I found myselflooking forward towatching a soap opera.

88
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,310
Which one?

89
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,340
Please,can you put meback to work,hotch?

90
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,750
The doctor hasn'tcleared you forthe field.

91
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,560
- Please,hotch.
- You need more time.

92
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,980
I've been outfor 4 months.

93
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,770
What I need is togo back to work.

94
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,430
We're goingto cleveland.

95
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,840
Reid's going tothe crimes againstchildren division.
Go with him.

96
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,070
- But I can--
- or go home.

97
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,110
I'm all yours,dr.Reid.

98
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,790
The image was uploaded toone of our C.A.C.Undercoversfishing in a chat room.

99
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,620
We try to monitoras many of them as we can,

100
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,060
pretending tobe children,pedophiles,whatever works on that site.

101
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,160
Did you run forensiclinguisticson the chat log?

102
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,370
There might besomething to hugz'speech patterns.

103
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,880
It doesn't really work thatway with internet talk.

104
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,670
Fear of flying?

105
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,730
Lengthy,deep-rootedissues of control?

106
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,790
I--think better on my feet.

107
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,970
Most of the talkis abbreviated text--

108
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,180
L.O.L.,Laughing out loud. I.M.H.O.,,In my humble opinion.F.T.F.--

109
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,830
- face to face.
- Right.

110
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,260
Uh,pedophilescan be dividedinto two categories...

111
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,980
situationaland preferential.

112
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,280
Situational offendersrarely seek out children,

113
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,740
but they'll take advantageof a situation whenpresented with it,

114
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:18,140
whereas preferential offendersactively target childrenby age group,hair color...

115
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,320
they'll seek out jobs whichgive them as much accessto children as possible.

116
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,260
The often trawl aroundresidential neighborhoods,hijacking homewireless systems

117
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,330
and communicatingwith childrenoften outside the veryhouse the child is in.

118
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,630
Or they'll simply usea wireless coffee shopto find,locate,and arrange a meeting.

119
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,910
And it's growing.

120
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,770
It's growing as fastas the internet.

121
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,200
They're gettingsmarter and smarter,

122
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,920
and all the securityin the worldcan't stop them fromcoming through our doors.

123
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,120
Hell,the monsters arealready in our homes.

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,690
If he's had this kidfor a year,it makeshim preferential.

125
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,120
Definitely.

126
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,210
So,then why ishe selling him?

127
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,180
Maybe,uh...
maybehe's losing interest.

128
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,590
Peter's maybe gettingtoo old,too tall.

129
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,090
Preferential offendersare very specificabout their preferences.

130
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,230
And if he can't sell him?

131
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,340
He isn't going tojust let him go.

132
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,710
Hotch?

133
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,060
Yeah?

134
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,680
Yeah,I was thinking,shouldn't we releasepeter's picture to the media?

135
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,950
No.No,no.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,240
If this unsub thinksthat we're on to him,he may make a run for itand dispose of the boy.

137
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,670
Shouldn't we assumehe does know?

138
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,400
As I said,we interceptedthis image as part ofan undercover operation.

139
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,060
These predators havea fairly closed society.

140
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,230
The way they run thesesites gives them theexpectation of anonymity.

141
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,170
Right.

142
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,000
Have reid and ellecheck the live feed.

143
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,970
Not just the boy,but everythingaround him--the room.

144
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,270
See if wemissed anything.

145
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,960
- Ok.
- Yeah.

146
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,820
Amanda gilroy.

147
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,640
You're the B.A.U.?

148
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,900
I'm spender reedand this isagent greenaway.

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,850
You're the agentwho had contact withthe image of peter.

150
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,810
This time.
A year ago,it was katie who firstidentified him.

151
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,580
- You call her katie?
- Everyone does.

152
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,370
She hatesto be called agent cole.

153
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,530
Make yourselves at home.

154
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,890
We just got yourwarrants approved.

155
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,310
Katie and your team areabout to pay a visit tothe chat room vendor.

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,730
Yeah.
Well,yeah.

157
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,090
We went overthe probability.

158
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,960
That's fine.

159
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,100
Yeah.

160
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,570
Yeah,one of our main onlinelisting sites is down,but we should beback online--fbi.

161
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,280
We have a warrantto search these premises.

162
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,330
Stop what you're doingright now.

163
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,980
I'm sorry.
I gotta go.

164
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,060
Can somebody tell mewho owns this place?
Ahem.

165
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,780
That'd be me.

166
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,540
I want access to yourchat room database.

167
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,560
It looks like thewalls are padded.

168
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,320
- And the dimensionsare strange.
- Strange?

169
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,300
- It looks like a hall,but smaller.
- A basement?

170
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,350
I don'tthink so.

171
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,710
Katie just got us accessto the originalchat room's database.

172
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,830
It's coming through now.

173
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,480
Must be thousandsof screen names there.

174
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,970
All encrypted.

175
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,430
Yeah,but we're onlyconcerned about one.

176
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,100
Hugz.

177
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,080
This is so typical.

178
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,730
You feds just can'thelp yourselves.

179
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,720
You gotta pollutethe truest form of freeexpression ever invented.

180
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,170
Agent find a chatroomof your choice.

181
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,580
Your name is susie.
You're 12 years old.

182
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,060
- What are you doing?
- Fishing.

183
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,950
You know,I've got rights,and so do my clients.

184
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,730
That's the soundof pedophiles lookingto hook up witha 12 year old girlnamed suzy.

185
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,090
You let them runeverything throughssl connectionsfrom proxy serversin offshore countries.

186
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,080
So they can't be identified?

187
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,440
Not in 12 1/2 hours.

188
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,080
Hey,I'm justa middleman here,ok?

189
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,570
What can I do?

190
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,530
There's a little boy forsale on one of your sites.

191
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,900
"What can I do"just isn't good enough.

192
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,140
Cole was right.

193
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,600
Hugz routed throughan offshore proxy.

194
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,840
So we have no wayof tracking him?

195
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,200
Not if you only track himwith his address.

196
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,550
What else do we have?

197
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,070
He used a basicencryption programto hide hispayment method.

198
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,000
And as you know,I'm anything but basic.

199
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,020
Ah,gotta lovethe money traila credit card leaves.

200
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,540
Well,well,well.
Graham rose,15 hauser lane,rimond,va.

201
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,060
Check this out,jj.

202
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,390
He used the same cardto pay for a web domain.

203
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,980
Oh,my god.

204
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,700
Gideon,we just foundanother child being held.

205
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,820
Fbi!

206
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,900
You're a bad boy.

207
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,630
You needed to be tied up,didn't you?

208
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,890
Let me see you struggle.

209
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,060
Clear! ********

210
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,260
Fbi!

211
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,400
What are you doing?

212
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,370
Where is he?

213
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,340
Where is who?

214
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,910
- It's ok.
- You're safe now.

215
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,240
Safe?

216
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,910
- What's your name?
- Kevin.

217
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,940
The man who didthis to you.
Is he still here?

218
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,100
It's my house.

219
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,340
Graham rose is theowner of this house.
Where is he?

220
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,120
No,no!
Don't touch that.

221
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,100
Back up.

222
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,100
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

223
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,340
What do you mean,gone?
He's just gone,ok?

224
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,630
- Graham roseis your father?
- Yeah,sure.

225
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,420
You can call him that.

226
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,040
I just call him a bastard.

227
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,210
You scared?

228
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,320
You think dad'smad at us?

229
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,790
The father's been in jailfor the last 8 months.

230
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,090
In that time,kevin'sbeen selling the onlything he's got,which is himself.

231
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,200
Just likea street hustler.

232
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,280
Only now the streetis the internet.

233
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,200
And his client basespans the globe.

234
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,560
Well,this kid definitelyuploaded peter's videoto the chat room,'cause it's stillon his computer.

235
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,840
Yeah,but notthe live feed.

236
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,460
He say how he gothold of the video?

237
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,700
He said it came fromone of his clients.

238
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,590
It was a shared file.

239
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,220
They'd gone aroundthese chat groups.

240
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,600
It's possible.

241
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,680
Buyers and sellers routine.

242
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,240
They trade files becausethe act in itselfis an illegal act,which proves they'renot the police.

243
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,840
I'll see what elsewe can find out.

244
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,150
Kid,the boy whose videoyou've been sending aroundto all the chat rooms,

245
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,040
he's gonna be sold fromone pedophile to another.

246
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,630
Boo-hoo.

247
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,520
These are dummy logs.

248
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,950
What's the passwordto get me intothe real transcriptsof your sessions?

249
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,400
You're the fbi.
You figure it out.

250
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,380
I know you don'tthink so,kevin,but we are tryingto help you here.

251
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,020
Help me?
What I dois consensual.

252
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,230
No one's getting hurt.

253
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,440
Come on,kevin,what's the password?

254
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,480
Your birthday?
Your favorite band?

255
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,080
Kevin,this is prostitution.

256
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,590
But I'm a minor.

257
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,530
I don't even reallyknow what I'm doing.

258
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:10,870
Plus I never leavethis room,so no one,no one ever touches me.

259
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,910
Anymore.

260
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,990
Your father's been beatingyou since you can remember.

261
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,000
First it was when he wasdrunk on the weekend,then he was always drunk.

262
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,250
You never knew whyhe was hurting you...

263
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,820
why he was so angry.

264
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,040
At night you'd cryyourself to sleep,hoping someone wouldcome and save you.

265
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,400
No one ever came.

266
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,660
You have the chanceto be the one whosaves someone,kevin.

267
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,660
You can be the onewho answers him,the one who stopshis pain.

268
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,180
You can't getto your father,but you can getto the guy who'shurting this boy.

269
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,250
Move.

270
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,590
This backs upall my transcripts.

271
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,280
The screen name of the guy whosent me the file is mehtevas.

272
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,550
Can you hear me?

273
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,210
Can I get out anytime soon?
Please?

274
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,700
He's got food and water,a toilet and some toys.

275
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,820
He never has toleave the room.

276
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,160
That's it!
It's not a room.

277
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,360
A room has a door.

278
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,110
Even a prisoncell has a door.

279
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,490
There are no windows,so he can't be seen,and the walls are paddedso he can't be heard.

280
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,450
The unsub's anticipatingbecoming a suspect.

281
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,620
So he's hidden the boy.

282
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
If there are no doors,how did he get the boyin the room?

283
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,880
It's like a shipin a bottle.

284
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,480
He's built the roomaround the boy.

285
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,680
How long has mehtevasbeen a client of yours?

286
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,180
Like,6 months.

287
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,700
Where is he located?
He's a local.

288
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,920
He's always askingto meet with me,but I don't do that.

289
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,930
- Does he knowwhere you are?
- Just the city.

290
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,480
- How do you contact him?
- He contacts me.

291
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,830
Come on,kevin.

292
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,680
You don't just sitaround here waitingfor these guysto look you up.

293
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,010
That's no wayto run a business.

294
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,060
Right now you'rethe only person whocan help us find peter.

295
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,170
What do youwant me to do?

296
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,440
Ask him fora face to face.

297
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,530
No.
No way.I don't do that.

298
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,690
- I've never beenout of this room.
- It'll be fine.

299
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,260
He won'tlay a finger on you.

300
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,720
We'll right there,kevin,the whole time.

301
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,440
I promise you.

302
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,050
Won't he be suspiciousif I suddenly wantto meet with him?

303
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,640
He's a need drivenoffender,kevin.

304
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,610
What does that mean?

305
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,540
if you offer tomeet with him,he won't be ableto resist.

306
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,260
He can't help himself.

307
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,870
You said that he firstappeared a year ago,right?

308
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,320
But he wasin a normal room.

309
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,880
The pictures didn'tlook like that.

310
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,290
Here.

311
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,910
So,something changed.

312
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,370
A stressor for himto lock him away.

313
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,700
Hey,guys.

314
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,280
What is it?

315
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,620
I'm not sure.

316
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,130
Wait,do you see howhe's looking off camera?

317
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Someone's telling himto do what he's doing.

318
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,590
A bidder who must wantto see him wearing...

319
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,690
wait a minute.

320
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,900
That's a tadpole shirt.

321
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,650
That's a tadpole shirt.
It's a wilderness group.

322
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,380
Knot tying.
Compass wielding.Boy stuff.

323
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,200
Are you sure?

324
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,870
I have 4 brothers,jj.
They all hadthat shirt.

325
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,530
Is that numberson his sleeve?

326
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,170
Wait,wait,enhance it.

327
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,610
Capture that imagewhen he turns.

328
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,190
The badge is torn.

329
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,210
It's like,4 numbers.
What is that?

330
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,000
3,something,something,6?

331
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,850
That's a unit number.
4 digits endingwith a 6.

332
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,600
999 possiblecombinations.

333
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,690
But a unit number wouldbe registered,right?

334
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,200
Already on it,kid.

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,630
Where are you going?

341
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,800

351
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,900

I haven't done anything.

386
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,890
You're an educatedman,mr.Rawlings.

387
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,250
You know you'rein trouble here.

388
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,100
I believe I just walkedoutside my school.

389
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,620
Is that a crime now?

390
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,840
You knowwhere he is?

391
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,110

You sent thisimage to kevin.

394
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,320
Well,that was wrongof me,I know,but I was so shocked.

395
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,840
I wanted to try to savethis poor boy.

396
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,320
I thought hugz--kevin--might know him.

397
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,810
That's why I sent himthe link to the website,see if he knew.

398

Kevin,too.

405
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,430
Sit down.

406
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,280
Tell me we gotsomething we can nailthe son of a bitch on.

407
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,040
Not unless we canbreak the passwordon this guy'scomputer.

408
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,150
- Call garcia.
- Take too long.

409
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,630
Come on,genius.

410
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,820
Do somethinggenius-like.

411
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,150
If this guy doeshave child pornographyon his computerand we type inthe wrong password,it could triggera virus that wipesthe entire hard drive.

412
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,580
What's he saying out there?

413
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,710
He's a preferentialpedophilewho claims he'strying to save theM.

414
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,630
Save them.

415
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,830
Mehtevas.

416
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,800
Can you getany closer?

417
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,600
I can,but it'll distortthe image even more.

418
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,100
There,see,the edgeof his badge,it looks like itsays "mount" something.

419
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,640
Ok.

420
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,250

Ok,hold on,garcia.
Hold on.

429
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,080
It's,uh,research.
I'm writing a book.

430
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,680
Sit down.

431
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,490
I swear to you thisis all just research.

432
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,690
It's not research.

433
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,410
It's 100 years in afederal penitentiary.

434
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,640
I'd like to make a deal.

435
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,550
No deals.

436
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,160
All you have is a very,verysmall amount of good will.

437
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,870
Tell me about peter.

438
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,120
I was contacted by theman who was holding him.

439
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,060
I didn't search outthis boy.

440
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,680
- I didn't go lookingfor this.
- Give me a name.

441
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,910
Well,I only knowthe screen name.

442
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,970
It's manchild.

443
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,870
Did you bid on peter?

444
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,200
How much?

445
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,800
$8,000.

446
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,060
But it was onlyin order to save him.

447
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,240
You the high bidder?

448
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,620
I--I think so,yes.

449
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,980
I was,anyway.

450
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:06,000
I was supposed to goback onlineand contact himon his web siteand get the address.

451
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,540
So you can inspectthe merchandise?

452
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,960
Look,this child isbeing auctioned off,and I am tryingto save him.

453
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,870
Trying to save him.

454
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,880
He'd have given you a code.
What is it?

455
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,580
Come on.

456
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,240
I have a family.
I have childrenof my own.

457
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,530
I love children.I would never harm them.

458
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:32,510
In your pursuitto save them,you think you could haveavoided having sex with them?

459
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,820
Mr.Rawlings.

460
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,990
The code.

461
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,810
Butterfly.

462
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,770
Dad?

463
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,060
Dad?
When can I come out?

464
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,960
I'm being a good boy.

465
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,270

Both agencies have declinedto comment on the arrestat this time,or give any details of the case,

but it is rumored to beconnected to the investigationof a child pornography ring.

Get Hotch on the phone.

480
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,030
She's sure aboutthis,right?

481
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,850
If garcia says thattadpoles shirt camefrom a unit inmount pleasant,then I gotta believe her.

482
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,000
She better be.Mount pleasantis 60 miles awayand there's onlytwo hours left onthe auction clock.

483
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,550
Maybe.

484
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,600
If the unsubknows we're on to him,he may movethat clock up.

485
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,700
Think this guy'sgonna panic?

486
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,920
I don't know.
Depends on hiscomfort level.

487
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,200
Maybe getting closeto auction time,he can wait it out.

488
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,020
I know one thing: Ican't lose peter again.

489
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,000
Well,let's justhope jj bought ussome time.

490
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,630
Mary,I need a favor.

491
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,810
It's absolutelyall right that youbroadcast this.

492
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,330
We have to bluffthis kid's captorinto believing we arein another locale.

493
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,330
It will buy us time.

494
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,420
This kid's lifedepends on it.
Ok,this is a lie.

495
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,600
Say the crimesagainst children unitis searching fora boy being heldcaptive in virginia.

496
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,490
He's approximately4 feet tall,he has brown hair.

497
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,610
We need you to get thison the air immediately.

498
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,770
Thank you.

499
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,950
The fbi has informed usthat they are looking fora missing 7 year old child.

500
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,150
This child is believedto be somewhere withinalexandria right now.

501
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,710
A door to door searchis being coordinatedby the members of the crimesagainst children unit.

502
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:39,890
The boy is described asapproximately 3 feet tallwith sandy brown hair.

503
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,180
Jj,it's back.

504
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,480
Uh,we got itback up,hotch.

505
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,500
We got an hour tillthe auction closes.

506
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,240
The site went dark fora few minutes and thencame back online.

507
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,800
So he believes the storyjj fed to the media.

508
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,350
But we've only gotan hour left.

509
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,480
RighT.

510
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,640
Tadpoles areaffiliated with a church.

511
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,860
When we getto mount pleasant,elle and morganshould go to the church.

512
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,500
We'll take the school.

513
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,850
Peter may beregistered there.

514
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,250
That sounds good.

515
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,220
I gave up on him.

516
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,760
A year ago,I gave upon looking for him.

517
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,230
There were so manyother kids.

518
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,650
Katie,I'm sure youdid what you could.

519
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,270
You ever ask yourselfhow you make a decisionlike that?

520
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,920
How we come tothe conclusionthat it's time to moveon to the next kid.

521
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,910
How do you give yourselfthat kind of permission?

522
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,430
What's happened tothat boy in the year istopped looking for him?

523
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,950
Recognize him?

524
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,510
Can't say that I do.

525
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,400
But you're certainthat the shirt camefrom this unit ofthe tadpoles,right?

526
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,560
It disbanded6 months ago,before i took overthe congregation.

527
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,100
Why?

528
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,110
I was told therewasn't enough interest.

529
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,440
Only a few boysparticipated.

530
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,380
Do you have the recordsof those who did participate?

531
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,400
How could anyonedo this to a child?

532
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,040
We need to find this boy.

533
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,450
The records.

534
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,140
I'm sorry.

535
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,400
I don't think so.

536
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,620
Wait.

537
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,170
There may be a photoof the tadpoles.

538
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,650
This boy's ina terrible state.

539
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,020
But do yourecognize him?
Please look carefully.

540
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,830
You said his appearancemay have been altered?

541
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,350
First or secondgrade student.

542
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,170
Let me check my records.

543
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,560
This may be whatyou're looking for.

544
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,620
Yeah,that's himright there.

545
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,990
Is there a name,address,anything?

546
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,010
As I said,there areno records left.

547
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,740
The church was run prettysloppily until I took over.

548
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,180
Let me see that.

549
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,420
His name's charlie.

550
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,230
This is everyonewho registered forthe second grade.

551
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,240
That's a lotof names.

552
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,930
What about the kidswho didn't register?

553
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,560
Excuse me?

554
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,550
Were there anyfirst graderswho didn't registerfor second grade?

555
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,540
I imagine therewere some transfers.

556
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,130
Yes.
Yes,therewere two transfers.

557
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,760
Ashley watersand charlie sparks.

558
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,750
Charlie sparks.

559
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,570
Does it say wherecharlie's records went?

560
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,090
His father pickedthem up himself.

561
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,260
Can you describethe father?

562
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,470
Oh,dear,no.
I'd have no idea.

563
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,480
- Thank you.
- The end of the school yearhere is so very hectic.

564
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,370
We have children from--

565
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,690
the name the schoolhas is charlie sparks.

566
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,540
No sparks in any ofthe phone directories.

567
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,970
Garcia can't even finda sparks within 100 milesfor the last 10 years.

568
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,490
Probably not hisreal name anyway.

569
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,610
The school said hemay have moved away.

570
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,190
Then we startover again.

571
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,940
We don't havea lot of time left.

572
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,510
Guys,maybe we're lookingat this the wrong way.

573
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,230
What do you mean?

574
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,890
The behavior,it's odd,right?

575
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,250
The unsub apparentlylisted this kid in schooland the tadpolesuntil about a year ago.

576
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,790
At that point he hadpictures of him onlinein a regular looking room.

577
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:35,500
But now he's ina prison-like roomwith no windows,no doors,completely hidden.

578
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,430
Preferential pedophilesdon't change overnight.

579
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,520
So,what happened a yearago to make him changehis behavior so much?

580
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,270
Fear.

581
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,130
Katie almost caught him.

582
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
You probablytalked to him.

583
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,350
The unsub'sin your records.

584
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,130
Guys,we justran out of time.

585
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,530
Dad!

586
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,560
Dad!

587
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,840
Dad?

588
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,160
I never reallyhad a good suspect.

589
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,280
I only did somegeneral interviewswith child offenderson the east coast.

590
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,830
One of them wasthe right guy.

591
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,940
Amanda,hey.

592
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,260
Uh,I need youto pull all ofthe original fileson peter's case.

593
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,770

594
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,520
I need the names ofeveryone I interviewed.

595
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,170
Have her callpenelope garciaat the B.A.U.

596
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,260
She'll be able to tell usif we can cross any off.

597
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,060
You got it?
Thanks.

598
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,770
- You still there?
- Yeah.

599
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,480
Oh,oh,oh,
Got it,got it,got it.

Ok,uh,frank portwell,dob 11 april 1962.

601
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,280
He's doing 12 yearsin westover prison.

602
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,560
Martin devries,dob 20 november '70.

603
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,890
Got a death certificatefor him.
Shot on the streetlast january.

604
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,510
All righT.

605
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,730
Michael earlson,dob...

606
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,040
garcia,you're sure?

607
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,380
Ok,no.No,no.
I got it all.I got it all.

608
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,420
All right,thanks,baby.
You're the best.

609
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,590
All right,guys.Listen up.
We might have something.

610
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,950
12 men were interviewed.

611
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,430
8 are back in prison,one is dead.

612
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:38,770
One lives in california,and two have lastknown addresses within10 minutes of us--a patrick forestand a michael earlson.

613
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,170
Patrick forest isn'tsmart enough to putthis all together.

614
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,850
- What aboutmichael earlson?
- Definitely.

615
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,260
Where are you going?********. don't move!

Peter's real name is *********.

623

*** adopted him in north new jersy when he was****

624
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,740
sometimes it's the same as ****** punishment enough.

625
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,810
jj chases his mother.

626
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,350
- she's on her way.
- okay.

627
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,460
you know katie,no one has ever done the job you are doing as long as you are doing it.

628
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,430
I know.

629
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,980
maybe it's time to get out.

630
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,080
I don't know if I can anymore.

631
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,980

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,790
okay.

636
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,390
It's gonna be a long process.

637
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,290
I'll have to ******

638
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,600
